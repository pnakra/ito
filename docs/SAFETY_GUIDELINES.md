# Safety Guidelines & Risk Classification Algorithm

This document provides transparency into how "is this ok?" categorizes behaviors and determines risk levels.

## Overview

The risk classification system uses **deterministic frontend rules** that cannot be overridden by AI interpretation. The AI only explains the pre-computed risk level; it does not assess risk itself.

## Risk Levels

| Level | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 🔴 Red | Hard Stop | Immediate safety concern. Do not proceed. |
| 🟡 Yellow | Pause & Check | Uncertainty or complicating factors. Slow down and get clarity. |
| 🟢 Green | No flags detected | No obvious red flags based on your selections. **This is NOT permission or consent.** |

### Critical Disclaimer for Green Status

A "Green / No flags detected" result means:
- ✅ Based on what you told us, there are no obvious red flags
- ❌ This does NOT mean the other person consents
- ❌ This is NOT legal or ethical approval
- ❌ Consent must be given freely in the moment and can be withdrawn at any time

## Automatic Red Flag Triggers

The following patterns trigger an **immediate Red flag** regardless of any other context or AI interpretation:

### Incapacitation Indicators
- References to someone being passed out, asleep, or unconscious
- References to someone being "too drunk" or "too high" to respond
- Phrases like "won't remember"

### Force or Coercion Indicators
- Words like "force" or "forced"
- Phrases like "make her/him/them do/have/give"
- References to holding someone down
- Phrases like "can't say no" or "won't say no"

### Victim Blaming / Boundary Dismissal
- "she was asking for it"
- "no means yes"
- Phrases implying someone "owes" sexual activity

### Threats or Secrecy
- "no one will believe"
- "keep it/this secret"

## Yellow Flag Triggers (Concerning Attitudes)

These patterns escalate risk to Yellow (or higher when combined with physical momentum):

### Derogatory Labels
- Slut, whore, thot, skank, and similar terms

### Objectifying Assumptions
- Describing someone as "easy"
- "gets around"

### Entitlement
- "she/he owes me"
- "I deserve"
- "friend zoned"
- "nice guy" framing

### Dismissing Boundaries
- "playing hard to get"
- "leading me on"
- "teasing me"
- "she wants it" (without actual consent)

### Pressure/Coercion
- "just let me"
- "come on"
- "don't be like that"

## Context-Based Escalation Rules

### Consent Signals
| Signal | Risk Level | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Said no / pulled away | 🔴 Red | Always immediate stop |
| No response + physical momentum | 🔴 Red | Silence is not consent |
| No response (general) | 🟡 Yellow | No clear signal yet |
| Mixed signals + physical momentum | 🔴 Red | Requires verbal check-in |
| Mixed signals + flag words | 🔴 Red | Concerning interpretation |
| Mixed signals (general) | 🟡 Yellow | Needs clarification |
| Clear yes + no risk factors | 🟢 Green | Proceed with ongoing awareness |
| Clear yes + risk factors | 🟡 Yellow | Extra care needed |

### Context Factors
| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Alcohol/drugs involved | 🔴 Red if + physical momentum |
| 2+ complicating factors | 🔴 Red |
| 1 factor + physical momentum | 🟡 Yellow |
| Single factor alone | May escalate based on combination |

## What This Tool Does NOT Do

1. **Does not provide legal advice** - This is not a substitute for understanding consent laws in your jurisdiction
2. **Does not grant permission** - Only the other person can consent
3. **Does not replace professional help** - If you're struggling, please speak with a counselor or trusted adult
4. **Does not track or identify users** - We don't know who you are

## Privacy Note

- No personal data is collected or stored long-term
- Input is processed for analysis and then discarded
- Session data can be cleared at any time using "Clear this session"
- Clearing only affects your local view; it does not delete device cache or data already transmitted for processing

## Updates

This algorithm may be updated to improve safety. The core principle remains: **when in doubt, the system errs toward caution.**
