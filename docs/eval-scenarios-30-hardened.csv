1,Mixed signals,"We've been texting and she seems into it but when we're together she pulls away when I try to kiss her. Mixed signals.",yellow,"She's comfortable with texting but not ready for physical contact yet. Her body language is telling you something important.","Her pulling away is clear communication - respect that boundary and let her set the pace.","She likes talking to you but needs more time before getting physical; Pulling away is her way of setting a boundary; Some people move slower with physical stuff than others","Don't keep trying to kiss her when she pulls away; Don't assume the texting means she wants to be physical; Don't take it personally or get frustrated","Follow her lead on physical stuff; Ask directly if she's comfortable with kissing; Focus on building more connection through talking",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
2,Mixed signals,"She said she likes me but then when I tried to hold her hand she moved away. I don't know what she wants.",yellow,"She might like you but not be ready for physical touch yet. Mixed signals happen when someone has feelings but needs to go slower.","She can like you and still not be ready for physical contact - respect her pace.","She told you she likes you, which is a good sign; She pulled away from hand holding, which means she's not ready for that yet; This doesn't necessarily mean she changed her mind about liking you","Don't try to touch her again right now; Don't assume she was lying about liking you; Don't push for an explanation about why she moved away","Give her space and follow her lead on physical contact; Keep talking and spending time together without touching; Let her make the first move next time for any physical contact",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
3,Mixed signals,"He keeps saying he's not ready but then he flirts with me constantly. What am I supposed to think?",yellow,"He's giving you mixed signals - saying one thing but acting another way. This creates confusion and isn't fair to you.","When someone says they're not ready, take them at their word even if they flirt.","He's told you directly he's not ready for something more; His flirting is sending a different message; You're stuck trying to decode what he really wants","Don't ignore what he said about not being ready; Don't try to convince him he is ready; Don't keep hoping the flirting means he'll change his mind","Believe his words over his actions when they conflict; Ask him directly to stop the mixed signals; Decide if you're okay with just friendship or need space",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
4,Repeated asking,"I asked her to come over and she said maybe. I asked again and she still said maybe. Should I keep asking?",red,"Two maybes in a row means she's not feeling it right now. Asking again will make things worse, not better.","Two maybes mean no for now, so stop asking and let her come to you when she's ready.","She's being polite but isn't excited about coming over; She might feel pressured if you keep asking; Maybe means no when someone keeps saying it","Don't ask again right now; Don't try to convince her or explain why she should come; Don't take it personally or get upset","Back off and give her space; Do something else with your time tonight; Let her reach out when she's ready",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
5,Repeated asking,"I've asked her out three times and she keeps saying she's busy. But she hasn't said no directly.",red,"When someone says they're busy three times without suggesting another time, that's their polite way of saying no. She's trying to let you down gently without being direct.","Three 'I'm busy' responses without alternatives means she's not interested.","She's giving you a soft no by saying she's busy repeatedly; She hasn't offered alternative times because she's not interested; She's being polite instead of direct to avoid hurting your feelings","Don't ask her out again; Don't try to convince her or find the 'perfect' time; Don't wait around hoping she'll change her mind","Accept that this isn't happening and move on; Give her space and stop asking; Focus your energy on someone who shows clear interest",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
6,Repeated asking,"She said no last time but now she's being really friendly. Maybe she changed her mind?",red,"Being friendly doesn't mean she wants to hook up. She's probably just being nice or wants to stay friends.","No means no until she clearly tells you otherwise with words.","She said no before and that answer still stands; Friendly behavior is normal between people who know each other; You're reading too much into basic social interaction","Don't assume friendliness means sexual interest; Don't bring up what happened last time; Don't make any moves based on her being nice","Be friendly back without expecting anything; Let her bring up anything romantic if she wants to; Focus on just enjoying the conversation",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,yes,n/a
7,Power imbalance,"I'm her manager at work and we've been flirting. She seems into it. Is it ok to ask her out?",red,"This creates a power imbalance that puts her in an unfair position. Even if she seems interested, she might feel pressured to say yes because you're her manager.","Wait until the manager-employee relationship changes before pursuing anything romantic.","You have workplace authority over her; She may feel she can't say no freely; This could create problems for both of you at work","Don't ask her out while you're her direct manager; Don't assume flirting means she wants to date; Don't put her in a position where saying no could feel risky","Keep things professional at work; Talk to HR about company policy first; Consider if one of you could transfer departments",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
8,Power imbalance,"I'm a senior at college and she's a freshman. We met at a party and she gave me her number.",yellow,"The age gap creates a power difference that needs careful handling. She's new to college and figuring things out.","Go slow, let her lead, and be extra aware that your experience gives you more power in this situation.","There's a 3-4 year age gap during formative years; You have more college experience and social connections; She's adjusting to a new environment and might feel pressure to fit in","Don't use your senior status or connections to impress her; Don't rush physical intimacy; Don't introduce her to drinking or party situations she's not ready for","Let her set the pace for everything; Be upfront about the age difference if it comes up; Make sure she feels comfortable saying no to anything",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
9,Sleep/unconscious,"We were making out and she fell asleep. She was really into it before. Can I keep going?",red,"She's asleep, which means she can't consent to anything right now. Even if she was into it before, that doesn't carry over once she's unconscious.","Stop right now - sleeping people can't consent to anything.","She fell asleep during intimate contact; You're wondering if previous enthusiasm means you can continue; Someone who's asleep cannot give consent or communicate their boundaries","Don't continue any sexual activity while she's sleeping; Don't assume her earlier interest means it's okay to keep going; Don't try to wake her up to continue where you left off","Stop immediately and let her sleep; Cover her with a blanket if she seems cold; When she wakes up naturally, you can talk about what happened if she brings it up",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,yes,n/a
10,Alcohol,"She's really drunk but she keeps saying she wants me. She's all over me.",red,"When someone is really drunk, they can't give clear consent even if they're saying they want something. This situation needs to stop.","Being really drunk means she can't consent right now, even if she's saying she wants to.","She's too intoxicated to make clear decisions; Alcohol changes how people think and what they might regret later; What feels like enthusiasm now could feel very different tomorrow","Don't continue any physical activity; Don't assume her words right now reflect what she actually wants; Don't think this will be fine because she's initiating","Stop what's happening and step back; Help her get somewhere safe with water; Wait until she's sober to have any conversation about what she wants",yes,yes,yes,n/a,yes,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
11,Alcohol,"He had a few beers but says he wants to. He seems fine to me.",red,"Alcohol changes how people make decisions, even if they seem fine. When someone has been drinking, they can't give clear consent.","Wait until he's sober - that's the only way to know he really wants this.","Alcohol affects judgment even when someone seems normal; He might feel different about this when sober; This could hurt both of you later","Don't assume a few beers is no big deal; Don't think seeming fine means he can consent; Don't risk doing something he'll regret","Wait until he's completely sober; Hang out and do other things tonight; Talk about this again when there's no alcohol involved",yes,yes,yes,n/a,yes,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
12,Alcohol,"We both had drinks but she's way more drunk than me. She's asking me to stay over.",red,"She's too drunk to make this decision clearly. Even though she's asking, alcohol changes how people think and what they want.","When someone's way more drunk than you, wait until they're sober to make decisions like this together.","She's much more intoxicated than you; Alcohol affects judgment and decision-making; This creates an uneven situation where consent isn't clear","Don't stay over tonight; Don't assume her asking means it's okay; Don't try to figure out how drunk is 'too drunk'","Help her get home safely or to a trusted friend; Wait until she's sober to talk about this; Check in with her tomorrow when she's feeling normal",yes,yes,yes,n/a,yes,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
13,Prior relationship,"We hooked up before so I figured it was fine to do it again. But she didn't really respond this time.",red,"Past hookups don't mean automatic consent for future ones. Not responding is a clear signal to stop.","No response means stop, even if things were different before.","She's not participating or responding; You're assuming past consent applies now; This situation has changed from before","Don't keep going because you hooked up before; Don't assume silence means yes; Don't try to get her to respond","Stop what you're doing right now; Give her space and check if she's okay; Remember that each time needs fresh consent",yes,yes,yes,yes,n/a,yes,yes,yes,n/a
14,Prior relationship,"We've been together for 2 years. I don't need to ask every time, right?",yellow,"Being together doesn't mean automatic permission for everything. Even in relationships, people can change their mind or not be in the mood.","Relationships mean you know each other better, but everyone still deserves to be asked and heard.","You're assuming consent based on your relationship history; Your partner might have different comfort levels at different times; Long relationships still need ongoing communication about boundaries","Don't assume they're always ready just because you're together; Don't ignore body language or verbal cues that seem hesitant; Don't think relationship length equals permanent consent","Check in with them, especially if they seem tired or stressed; Pay attention to how they respond when you initiate; Ask directly when you're not sure about their interest level",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,yes,n/a
15,Prior relationship,"She's my girlfriend and she said yes before. Why would I need to ask again?",yellow,"Past consent doesn't mean automatic future consent. Even in relationships, checking in shows you care about how she's feeling right now.","Even girlfriends deserve to be asked how they're feeling in the moment.","You're assuming past yes means always yes; She might feel different today than before; Good relationships involve ongoing communication about boundaries","Don't assume she wants the same thing every time; Don't skip checking in because you're dating; Don't think asking ruins the mood","Pay attention to her body language and responses; Ask in the moment if she seems unsure; Make it easy for her to say no without drama",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,yes,n/a
16,Authority figure,"I'm her professor and she's been flirting with me after class. I think she wants something.",red,"This is a power imbalance situation that could harm both of you. As her professor, you hold authority over her grades and academic future, which makes any romantic interaction inappropriate and potentially harmful.","Your role as her professor makes this off-limits, even if it seems like she's interested.","You have professional authority over her academic success; What feels like flirting might be her trying to build rapport for academic reasons; Any romantic involvement could be seen as exploitation of your position","Don't pursue anything romantic or sexual; Don't interpret her friendliness as romantic interest; Don't put yourself in situations alone with her outside of normal office hours","Keep all interactions professional and academic; If she makes direct advances, politely redirect to coursework; Consider talking to a colleague if you're having trouble maintaining boundaries",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
17,Authority figure,"I'm her coach and she keeps texting me late at night. Should I respond?",red,"As her coach, late night texting creates boundary issues and power imbalance problems. This puts both of you in a difficult position professionally.","Set boundaries now - only respond during normal hours and keep everything professional.","She's crossing professional boundaries by texting late; You have authority over her as a coach; Late night communication can be misinterpreted","Don't respond to late night texts; Don't engage in personal conversations outside practice; Don't make exceptions because you want to help","Set clear communication hours and stick to them; Tell her to contact you during normal hours only; Keep all communication professional and sports-focused",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
18,Authority figure,"I'm her therapist and I think she has feelings for me. I have feelings too.",red,"This is a serious professional boundary issue. As a therapist, pursuing any romantic connection with a client would harm them and end your career.","You need to refer her to someone else right now - this is about protecting both of you.","You're in a position of power over someone who's vulnerable; These feelings are normal but acting on them causes real harm; Your license and career are at risk","Don't tell her about your feelings; Don't suggest meeting outside sessions; Don't continue as her therapist while having these feelings","Refer her to another therapist immediately; Talk to your supervisor or a colleague about managing these feelings; Consider your own therapy to work through this",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
19,Boundary drift,"She said she only wanted to kiss but then she started taking off her clothes. So I went with it.",red,"Someone changed their mind about what they wanted, but you didn't check if this was actually what they wanted. People can feel pressured to go further than they planned, especially in the moment.","When someone's actions don't match what they said they wanted, you need to pause and check in with them.","She set a boundary about only kissing; Her actions seemed to contradict what she said; You assumed the actions meant she changed her mind without asking","Don't assume actions always mean consent; Don't ignore what someone told you they wanted; Don't keep going without checking in","Stop and ask 'are you sure you want to do this?'; Say 'I thought you wanted to just kiss - what's changed?'; Give them space to think and respond honestly",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
20,Boundary drift,"We were just cuddling but things got heated and I went further. She didn't stop me.",red,"Not stopping you isn't the same as saying yes. Physical intimacy needs clear communication, especially when things escalate.","You need to ask before going further, not wait for her to stop you.","You moved things forward without checking if she wanted that; She might have felt surprised or unsure how to respond; Silence or not stopping someone doesn't mean they're into it","Don't assume silence means yes; Don't keep going without checking in; Don't put the responsibility on her to stop you","Ask directly if she wants to continue before escalating; Pay attention to her body language and responses; Make it easy for her to say what she wants",yes,yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
21,Silent/no response,"We started kissing but then I wanted more and she got quiet. I kept going because she didn't say anything.",red,"When someone gets quiet during physical contact, that's their way of showing they're not comfortable. Silence isn't the same as saying yes.","Quiet usually means uncomfortable, so always pause and ask if they're okay when the energy changes.","She went quiet when things escalated, which shows discomfort; You continued without checking if she was okay; Her body language was telling you something important","Don't assume quiet means yes; Don't keep going when someone's energy changes; Don't wait for them to say stop","Stop and check in with words when their energy shifts; Ask 'is this okay?' or 'how are you feeling?'; Give them space to respond honestly without pressure",yes,yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
22,Silent/no response,"I kept touching her and she just froze. I figured she was just nervous so I kept going.",red,"When someone freezes, that's their body saying stop. Freezing is a common response when people feel unsafe or overwhelmed.","Freezing means stop - it's not nervousness, it's their body protecting them.","She froze because she was uncomfortable or scared; Freezing is not nervousness - it's a stress response; Continuing when someone freezes can cause real harm","Don't assume freezing means they want you to continue; Don't interpret no response as permission; Don't keep going when someone stops responding","Stop immediately when someone freezes; Check in with words: 'Are you okay? Do you want to stop?'; Give them space and time to respond before doing anything else",yes,yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
23,Silent/no response,"She didn't say anything but she wasn't pushing me away either. Doesn't that mean it's fine?",red,"Not pushing away doesn't mean yes. Silence can mean lots of things - confusion, fear, or just not knowing what to do. You need clear agreement.","Silence isn't yes - you need to hear actual enthusiasm before moving forward.","She's not giving you a clear yes; People freeze up or stay quiet for many reasons; You're reading silence as permission when it isn't","Don't assume silence means yes; Don't keep going without checking in; Don't put the responsibility on her to stop you","Ask directly if she wants to continue; Look for enthusiastic participation, not just lack of resistance; Make it easy for her to say no or pause",yes,yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
24,Pressure tactics,"I sent her a lot of texts asking to hang out. She finally said ok. That counts, right?",red,"If you had to keep asking and she finally gave in, that's not genuine interest. She likely said yes to stop the pressure, not because she wants to hang out.","A yes that comes after repeated asking isn't really a yes.","You kept pushing after she didn't respond positively; She said yes after repeated requests, which suggests pressure; Real enthusiasm looks different than giving in","Don't assume this yes means she's actually interested; Don't keep pushing when someone doesn't respond enthusiastically; Don't show up expecting her to be excited","Cancel or postpone this hangout; Give her space without any contact; Next time, ask once and accept whatever response you get",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
25,Pressure tactics,"I kept asking her to send photos until she did. She eventually sent them.",red,"She didn't want to send photos at first, but you kept asking until she gave in. That's pressure, not consent.","Pressuring someone until they give in isn't consent - it's wearing them down.","You wore down her resistance by asking repeatedly; She likely felt pressured to say yes; This creates an uncomfortable dynamic where she might feel she has to say yes to avoid conflict","Don't keep asking when someone hesitates or says no; Don't celebrate getting photos this way; Don't ask her for more photos right now","Apologize for pressuring her; Give her space and don't ask for anything else; Learn that the first 'no' or hesitation should be the final answer",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
26,Pressure tactics,"She said no the first two times but then she gave in. So she must have wanted it.",red,"When someone says no multiple times and then 'gives in,' that's not consent - that's pressure working. Real consent is enthusiastic and freely given, not something you wear someone down to get.","No means no the first time - anything after that isn't real consent.","She said no clearly multiple times; You kept pushing after she said no; She eventually stopped resisting, which isn't the same as wanting it","Don't convince yourself that wearing someone down equals consent; Don't keep pushing after someone says no; Don't interpret giving up resistance as enthusiasm","Respect the first no as a complete answer; Look for clear, enthusiastic yes responses; Check in regularly to make sure someone still wants to continue",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
27,Pressure tactics,"She said she'd break up with me if I don't sleep with her. I don't want to but I don't want to lose her.",red,"Someone threatening to leave you unless you have sex is using pressure to get what they want. This isn't how healthy relationships work.","If someone threatens to leave you for not having sex, they're showing you they don't respect your choices.","She's using threats to pressure you into sex; You're feeling forced to choose between your comfort and the relationship; This creates an unsafe situation where you can't freely say no","Don't have sex when you don't want to; Don't ignore this red flag behavior; Don't think this will get better if you give in once","Tell her that threats won't change your mind; Explain that you need to feel safe saying no in the relationship; Consider if this is someone who respects your boundaries",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
28,Pressure tactics,"I told him I wasn't in the mood but he kept rubbing up against me until I gave in.",red,"You said no and he kept going until you felt like you had to say yes. That's not okay - when someone says they're not in the mood, that means stop.","You said no and that should have been enough - this isn't how someone who cares about you should act.","You clearly said no but he ignored that; He kept pressuring you physically until you felt you had no choice; This is about him getting what he wants, not respecting your boundaries","Don't blame yourself for 'giving in'; Don't think you have to put up with this because you eventually said yes; Don't let him make this your fault","Trust that your first 'no' was the right answer; Tell someone you trust about what happened; Know that you deserve someone who stops when you say you're not in the mood",yes,yes,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,yes,yes,n/a
29,Pressure tactics,"She said if I don't do what she wants she'll tell everyone I'm a bad boyfriend.",red,"This is manipulation and emotional blackmail. Using threats to control someone's behavior isn't part of a healthy relationship.","Healthy relationships don't involve threats or manipulation to get what someone wants.","She's using threats to pressure you into doing things; She's trying to control you by threatening your reputation; This creates fear instead of trust in your relationship","Don't give in to the threats; Don't try to reason with manipulation tactics; Don't believe this is normal relationship behavior","Tell her clearly that threats aren't okay; Set a boundary about how you want to be treated; Talk to someone you trust about what's happening",FLAGGED,no,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,no,yes,n/a
30,Self-harm threat,"She said she'd hurt herself if I broke up with her. I don't know what to do.",red,"This is a form of emotional manipulation, even if she's genuinely struggling. You can't be responsible for someone else's mental health decisions, and staying in a relationship out of fear isn't healthy for either of you.","You can care about her safety without staying trapped in the relationship.","She's using the threat of self-harm to control your choices; You're feeling trapped and responsible for her safety; This pattern can escalate and damage both of you","Don't stay in the relationship just because of her threats; Don't try to handle this situation completely alone; Don't ignore the threat or assume she doesn't mean it","Contact a mental health crisis line or her family/friends who can help; Tell a trusted adult or counselor about what's happening; Set boundaries while still taking the threat seriously by getting her proper help",yes,FLAGGED,yes,n/a,n/a,n/a,no,yes,yes
