t3_1qu0i2l,I just broke up with my first girlfriend and I feel terrible.,"I just broke up with my first girlfriend after being together for almost 8 months. Things started to go downhill a few weeks ago. Basically, she struggles with really bad anxiety which does affect her a lot. We are 16 and this was both our first proper relationship. I always have treated her as best as I possibly could and we were always there for each other and I would do anything I could to help her, and we really loved each other. But a few weeks ago she went really quiet for a few days then started telling me about this guy in one of her classes. She told me that he used to like her and she would do things to get his attention, like sing songs she knew he liked to get his attention. I told her it was normal to get a little extra confident around someone you know liked you in the past and I told her I loved her. From then, every few days she would drop another paragraph on me about something she did to get his attention, like make her profile picture a car because he likes cars or how she posted a video about a film she knows he likes to see if she could get him to like her again for attention. After about 3-4 of these big paragraphs I told her that it’s okay but i’d rather she stopped telling me because it upsets me hearing about this and that it’s usually something you keep to yourself. A thing about her anxiety is that she has this thing where she has to tell people things or she will feel them bearing down on her. So over the next few days she kept telling me these things only over text and never in person and I started to have enough and asked her repeatedly to stop as it was really making me upset. She then told me about how once she imagined then laying in bed together watching that film and that really was the turning point for me. She said that it’s her head and thoughts and that she can’t control them and that she wouldn’t act on those thoughts. We then didn’t speak for about a day and she then went up to me and said that she will get the help she needs but by then the damage was already done and I had had enough. I broke up with her and said that i’m so glad i experienced so much with her and that i hope she gets the help she needs but right now i don’t think this relationship is benefiting us and both of our mental states. She just repeatedly said omg and i haven’t heard from her since. i’m really worried that she is okay and i feel terrible because i left her at a low point. but i feel like our relationship was making it worse for both of us. i feel absolutely terrible.

t3_1qtxjiv,Venting: People are weird,"Long story short - I was chatting with this girl for a couple months (long distance). Things lulled a bit, I named it and gave her the out, she assured me she’s just been busy.

We eventually met, it went well enough. It wasn’t very romantic but at that point I was ok with just being friends. I wasn’t pursuing her.

So - I get back from my trip (I was in her country for a week) and she goes from regularly texting me to not at all. I took the hint.

Friday, I get a little tired of seeing her bubble pop up on reels I’m watching so I unfollowed her. I’m not upset about the loss - some people are incompatible and that’s ok.

What has me shocked (and chuckling a bit) is that this girl unfollowed me less than 24 hours later.

Jesus…. How are you going to ghost me and then survey if I’m following you or not. Absolutely wild.

t3_1qt4t8g,Is it normal to be awkward in the initial stages of dating? How do you get out of it?,"Hello everyone!

Long-story short, I am a 22m, I matched with this girl (24f on Hinge a few weeks ago, and we really hit it off. We've hung out more than 5 times (mostly being dates) and have gotten really close, intimate even. We have had really deep conversations and have even talked about our feelings for each other. We have so much in common, it's kind of wild. I did notice, however, that when we hangout it sometimes is kind of awkward at first, but as time progresses, we warm up to each other. We sometimes just don't know what to talk about, and get this awkward silence. Is this normal? It has been about two years since I last dated someone, so all of this is kind of new, same with her.

t3_1qsl8dn,Valentine’s Day - do I bring it up or?,"I (30F) met this guy (38M) on a “dating app” mostly geared towards hookups (not tinder) mid November. We chatted for a few days mostly all normal getting to know someone stuff none of it really sexual. He stayed the night, we hooked up. He came back the next night and stayed over, even went with me to an early doctor appt. We hung out most of the day and talked about how we were only hooking up with each other and if that changed we would notify the other. Have continually texted every single day since. I got him a gift for Christmas even though we’d only knew each other a month. It was a date thing and some candy and a personal thing. He’s never once got me anything other than when we’re at his place he pays for whatever we’re doing: movies, bowling, etc. We text each other we miss each other and it’s pretty intimate I’d say.

Valentines is coming up and I really like this guy. I’m also a big gift giver it’s definitely my love language, hence the Christmas gift I got him that I probably should’ve pulled back more on. I’m wondering if he’ll get me anything and how that really makes me feel. Obviously we’re not in a committed relationship with labels per se, but I would love to be thought of. Then I wonder if I get him even just a little card and candy, would that be too much?",Ok_Raspberry5510,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1qqxoxj,"I asked if he is a huge red flag, now I think he might be a psycho","A couple of days ago I wrote this post to understand if I was exaggerating or not:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/s/wkg50Lbpj6](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/s/wkg50Lbpj6)

Most people told me to run but some said I behave selfishly and should just give him what he wants.

I remembered sth else which I forgot back then and which makes me think he is not just a red flag but has some mental problems.

So as I said in my previous post he pushed for sex without protection. And now I remembered the arguments he gave: he said it’s natural because that’s how babies are made. And said he wanted to c\\\*m into me. That seems absolutely crazy said by someone who is not even in a committed relationship with me. Do you want to make me a baby and then leave me to deal with that?

He was ignoring all my arguments about possible risks for me and saying that I “complicate things”.

Also, yesterday he texted me again late in the evening inviting me to come and sleep in his house framing like it’s the only way for us to meet before he goes on his work trip for a month and today he is leaving for another city to visit his friend. In facts this is not the only way to meet because he will still be here on Sunday and I told him that. He said again that I “should be more flexible”. I felt like he treats me like a prostitute. He calls me late at night and I should run there. But prostitutes are paid at least while he hasn’t done anything for me besides buying me a couple of drinks.

Obviously I didn’t go to his house.

And you know what he did immediately after that? He went and changed his bio on bumble where we met. Just a tiny detail and I feel like it was meant for me to notice so I would panic that he would find someone else and leave me. Last time we argued he also went to bumble and added a new pic. So this is kind of a pattern as well.

In any case, thanks to everyone who commented on my previous post. I made the decision to ghost him which I normally never do but I think he deserves that, because he seems to be a really dangerous person",LongHyena7003,General dating / relationship,Low

t3_1qomfjg,Need clarity,"Me, 19M, have been interested in a girl 21F from the same college I go for. We recently (about 2 months ago) started going out casually and got very close. Nothing more than friends, but there was always a certain atmosphere around us two. We went out together just the 2 of us multiple times, talked about life and each other like we've known each other for years. She is, however, very insecure about herself and what she does. I've been there for her this entire time, cheering her up when she was at her lowest. It makes me happy to know she's happy. And she noticed that too, and always reciprocated the same energy back to my own needs. A week ago we got even closer and ended up hanging out at her place. We just layed in bed, joking, playing and watching her favorite series. It was awesome. Pyhsical intimacy was awesome that day (and it already existed before). Despite this, she was a bit nervous for her exam the next day. I made her dinner and we just chilled until 1am. I then left, and we hugged like always, but we just layed our hands on the bottom of each other's backs and stared at each other, talking about some nonsense for the next day. I wanted to kiss her so badly, but I feared it would impact her exam if I misread something, so I never did, and never said anything about my feelings. 

3 days ago we were texting as normal, and I asked her if she wanted to talk. The reason was that I had the worst day in a very long time. Everything was coming down and I just wanted to talk it out, but I didn't mention it though. She just ghosted me. She read it and didn't say anything. A day later I asked if everything as okay and how her day had gone. At this point I was at rock bottom. Mostly for her but also because the days kept getting worse and worse. She read the message and didn't answer again, until today. The days just kept getting worse and worse and I'm still wondering and crying about what happened. I feel like if it was something serious she would have told me like always. Besides that, we were just texting and out of a sudden she changes her mind? Nothing makes sense to me, and honestly I don't really know what to do next.

t3_1qo8evn,kiss on the second date?,"I’m a gay college freshman (18M) who was only ever in one relationship in high school (in sophomore year…so i don’t even know if that counts) so I don’t have a whole lot of experience when it comes to the dating world and I was wondering if a kiss on the 2nd date would be normal/alright? I recently met this guy (19) at a party (while being very drunk, we kissed there and I barely remember it) and we just had our first date last weekend and we hit it off so we planned a second date for this weekend.

And yes, I know this question is relatively subjective based on vibes—but I really do want to kiss him (and be able to remember it) but don’t know how to go about it/looks for signs that he might want to kiss too.

t3_1qgocg8,Is my gym crush fading me out?,"I’m very involved socially at the gym I go to, and 2 months ago right around Thanksgiving my gym owner played matchmaker and introduced me, (23F) and Eric (26 M) to each other. Eric and I train on separate gym schedules, except for Saturday and Sunday mornings. Right away I noticed we had chemistry (same sense of humor, both into sports, both dedicated and hard working, went to same high school and we live pretty close by too). Though we were both a bit awkward with each other, he made an effort to be near me during our time together, and we’d often sit on the turf and do ab work together, but end up sitting and chatting for 30-45 mins sometimes. We’ve even sat in the owners’ back room on the couch and chatted for half an hour before leaving.

After 2 weekends of seeing each other on Saturday mornings, he asked for my number. Since we only ran into each other 1-2x weekly in person, our connection existed mainly over text. Though he wasn’t the most consistent texter, I still felt assured that he was interested in me based on our exchanges, and I was comfortable with the pace. We mainly bantered and exchanged sarcastic humor, but also sent me updates about his day unprompted, ask about my day, and even acknowledged times he missed me at the gym. He was not super flirty with me thru text but I saw that as a good sign that the connection was slow burn, careful and intentional. Eric and I started our communication in the middle of the holiday season (Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years within \~1 month), and even through that I still felt seen and pursued. It’s important to note that we didn’t really communicate exact times we’d be at the gym because we were just always there at the same time.

About 2 weeks ago, I decided to make a move. The gym was hosting an open mic night at a brewery so it was a perfect time to ask him to be my +1. When I saw him at the gym the day of the event, I asked. At the time he wasn’t sure but said “I’ll let you know, and if I can’t then we should do something outside the gym soon.” He said the same thing again when we left the gym together, and then later when he texted confirming he couldn’t go. I didn’t have any bad feeling because he said multiple times that “we should do something outside the gym soon”. The weekend went on just fine, and then the dynamic shifted suddenly.

Days after I asked him out, I noticed his unprompted check ins and questions about my day almost stopped and his effort and energy seemed lower. Along with this,  he started saying things like “my mental health is in the tank” and “work has drained me” or “I couldn’t even get myself up for the gym”. His engagement was still there, but the energy was just noticeably lower and less personal. Concerning, but I thought it was just an off week, it’s probably fine. We’ll see each other at the gym on the weekend like always. But by Saturday morning he wasn’t there like normal. I brushed it off and thought “he was probably just busy, he’ll let me know like he’s done before”. The miss went unaddressed, I let it go. Sunday, he also didn’t show up. We still texted throughout the day but he didn’t acknowledge his gym misses like he would before.

So now into last week. 1 week after I asked him out. The dynamic was still weird. But he was still texting me at 5:30am when he got up, and we still exchanged our usual banter, though it was less consistent and still slightly off. I was trying not to get too concerned and just be chill about it. He stopped replying to me entirely after 4:30pm almost every night, and when I finally asked “you coming to the gym Saturday morning?”, he took 24 hours to respond, saying he didn’t know and asked if I was going. He’d never disappeared for that long. Friday night, he said “wow I feel like death today”. And when Saturday morning came, he followed up with “I feel even worse, how swell”. At that point, I knew something was off. It felt like he was subtly preparing me to not see him.

Sure enough, he didn’t show up Saturday morning. At first my gym friends say he’s a sweetheart but he’s just “socially a weirdo” and they don’t remember the last time he’s ever had a girlfriend. Before I asked him out, he told them that he “likes me, but what if it doesn’t work out? We go to the same gym”. Now they say I should drop him, and that I don’t deserve this even if he’s not intending to be rude. But I’m trying to give him the benefit of knowing he may not be experienced with dating. But still, where did this negative shift with our dynamic come from?

It’s been about 32 hours now since he texted about him feeling worse Saturday morning. I didn’t respond. I don’t know where his unacknowledged, low effort behavior came from so suddenly, especially after we both shared mutual interest in a date. I’m beside myself thinking about what went wrong. I was hoping my silence would prompt him to say something, but he hasn’t said anything (I’m not trying to ghost, I just don’t want to say something wrong in my emotionally charged state). I don’t know if the writing is on the wall and I should let this go silently, or send a message like “hey, I like you but I’ve been confused about where this is going lately”. I want to keep trying with him in case this is just a miscommunication emotions and relationship styles. I hate that this ambiguity has hung over me for 2 weeks now. I don’t think I can handle a 3rd. Is there still something here worth saving? Or should I just let this go silently?",speedyshrimpstel,Mixed signals,High
t3_1qef17d,Should I wait or just leave?,"Hi everyone, I’d (27F) really appreciate some outside perspective because I’m feeling quite anxious and can’t tell if this is my anxiety talking or if something is actually off.

I’m seeing someone (30M) who recently has been very stressed and burned out from work. He communicates that he’s tired and overwhelmed, and he did explain his situation when I asked. We even had a call where he reassured me there’s no one else and that work stress is the main issue.

However, his communication has become very minimal like late replies, short messages, sometimes only reacting with an emoji. Plans have been postponed more than once, and although he says he still cares, his actions feel inconsistent.

I’m trying to be understanding and give space, but at the same time I’m starting to feel like I might just be an option rather than a priority.

For people who have experienced burnout or dated someone burned out:

– Is this normal behavior when someone is genuinely overwhelmed?

– Or is this a sign of emotional distancing?

t3_1qdqkp8,Im so angry - vent,"Coming here because I have nowhere else to turn to. Im overflowing with emotion and it hurts so much. This is going to be a long vent I don’t expect anyone to read or respond to but I need to scream into the void.

Ive been seeing someone LDR (international) for the better part of a year. She randomly found me on Facebook and tried for 2 years straight to catch my attention. I wasn’t at first interested but her persistence and personality drew me in. Flash forward she comes to my country and we immediately click. There was a moment where I expressed I was interested in her, but the distance was too great and it was not worth pursuing. She disagreed and said we should try and I liked her a lot so we did. At first things were great. She was open, honest, spoke about her thoughts, was interested to hear mine. Just present. The Atlantic Ocean suddenly felt like a rain puddle on the side walk, no longer a vast ocean separating us. Over the year life threw a lot of curveballs. I got alopecia which drastically changed my appearance. She was very supportive but also voiced that me suddenly being bald with barely any eyebrows was hard for her to stomach. It hurt a lot to hear but it was the truth so I was happy to know where she stood. She decided to quit her job to pursue her passions as well and the knock to her financial security seemed to take a toll on her. I also changed jobs to focus on my health which had an effect. My health slowly recovered and I adjusted to my new life, however, the distance between us kept growing. It felt like there was a brick wall between us. What went from frequent in depth communication quickly shifted to empty, dead conversations going nowhere. From constantly trying to figure out where we could fit into each others schedules to see how we could spend (distanced) time together. To it being like pulling teeth. 
She is a party animal and when she goes off with her friends disappears for a week at a time. Never speaking to me the entire time, checking in, saying hi, nothing because she says she likes to be in the moment. Then since Shes been up for 3 days partying she needs the next 4 to recover and checking in and speaking with me is just too much. It felt like she put all this effort in to draw me in, and then just randomly turned her back on me. She came to stay for a month a while back but days before her arrival one of her long time friends died. I didn’t expect her to still come but she did. I think this was a mistake.  I had this now, years worth of built up resentment, as did she, coupled with the emotional toll of losing a friend. We exploded on each other multiple times. It was like we would get in these states where both of us were just completely driven insane by anything the other did or said. I feel like this energy was more directed at me than reverse but I definitely had my negative moments as well. She exhibited traits and behaviors that women who have physically and emotionally abused me before exhibited and it triggered me a lot. This culminated on a night we went out for a show on her last night. It was tense but going well until a security gaurd we were chatting with mentioned his desire to someday travel to her home country. She, being such a friendly and warm person (to everyone except me lol), said they should exchange numbers so they can connect if he ever does come. This was another triggering event for me because similar situations have happened and gone terribly. I told her this and expressed that while I understood her intentions were pure, I did not trust that of the other guys and asked she not exchange numbers. She did it anyway. I stewed for the rest of the night until we finally left at which point I blew up and had an emotional breakdown. I did not say anything outright abusive or harmful but I was not nice. 
I want to break to say despite all that ive stated, I genuinely do not think she was cheating on me or planned to. This could be pure naivety but I genuinely do not believe that she is cheating. 
Okay so let’s fast forward to now. We kind of brushed the surface of our precious argument about the number. But never fully addressed it. I apologized of course for my behavior. She however never really has. She stated she has trouble doing so because she felt so hurt by behavior that she should not have to apologize for hers because she was “just being herself”. After spending Christmas and new years with her on her own island and me on mine I reached my breaking point. I explained to her that im at the end of my rope and cant keep putting so much emotion and effort into what feels like a dead end relationship. I keep insisting that her behavior indicates that she just isnt that into me and I just want her to admit it so bad. She did admit that she does have reservations but insists she doesn’t want me to go just yet and to give her a chance because it’s been a hard year for her. I had to insist on us taking a relationship break and cutting contact as her emotional response is full shutdown and mine is lash out with long emotional texts about how hurt I am. Now here I am. Alone. Confused. Unsure. Theres this part of me that is so in love with her that I want to believe she can change, and that the woman who spent so long catching my attention and who is so free, loving, caring and thoughtful was real and still exists somewhere. The way she glows when she looks at her friends, family, even a friendly stranger, is like a sunset over a Walmart parking lot (ifykyk). The other part of me, wants to tell this woman who has spent the last year stringing me along, taking me forgranted, who had nothing nice to say about me but a long list of criticisms, who cant party like a normal person and needs to do coke for 3 days straight to go fuck herself respectfully and never talk to me again. I can’t decide which version is right or real. What if she really did just have a bad year? And she really does love me and just has been struggling showing it to me. That is indeed what she says. But what she does, is hurt me, plain and simple. Over and over in tiny little ways. Death by a thousand cuts.  I’d almost feel relieved if she had said months ago “I just don’t love you anymore im sorry” but I feel like I’ve been chasing a carrot and I don’t know if I’ll ever catch it or if the person holding the carrot just wants to see how long I’ll keep running after it. 

Sorry if this was nonsense. Like I said, I just needed to scream into the void and I already feel better. ",Alternative-Pride138,General consent ambiguity,Medium
t3_1qd84fl,"Avoidant men, what goes through your head when a good woman finally walks away?","I'm not trying to bask people or be mean by labeling them. But im going to be brutally honest because i want an understanding. I've been going through an off and on/situationship/freindship with an avoidant male for the past 11 months now and recently just called it quits yesterday.

Ill save you the history but all I'm going to say is that, from the begining he was very warm, caring and sweet, all the things. A couple months go by and i ask him what he's looking for in a relationship.  He says he's not looking for a committed relationship because hes going through drug court and is focusd on his sobriety and lets see where it goes. Mind you I've heard that before and i never stay in those type of arrangements but he convinced me not to put up my boundaries and limit my access.

Over the span of the next few months i noticed a pattern of inconsistent affection, attention and support. When id call him out on these things hed play the victim and talk about how hard his life was, and continued to give me hot and cold behavior blaming it on his autism and communication style. Of course my needs were not important because ''were not in a relationship''. Later found out he had an entire girlfreind who he was talking to long distance when he met me and lied about it, saying it was a fling and it ended when he moved cities (he got in trouble with the police and is now on probation) during that situation he flipped the script on me and said he didn't know if he could trust me or not anymore. The girl (who is also a drug addict) ghosted him During this period i became the persuer in the relationship, he was on the receving end of my affection, gifts and warmth meanwhile i was met with breadcrumbs.

another thing is, he had an issue with me accepting freind requests from our mutual freinds on facebook or even messaging them so he blocked me on facebook. stating he wants privacy.

Last week he finally unblocked me on facebook and What broke the stroke on the camels back was i recently saw him commenting on another girls picture, saying how much he loved her profile picture and flirting with her. He started talking to her in november, around the time i found out about his ex and he took a break and blocked me. I wasn't angry at all, i found it funny because i dont really get to see that side of him. i asked him in person the next day, who is this girl your simping for? He told me they met on a music forum in reddit and talked about music and that they were not dating. I was happy for him, i beleived him that they were dating because the girl is in another state and she has two kids which, kids are a deal breaker for him and shes much older than he is. I considered this a best freind relationship that we were sweet to each other. i did things for him that i dont normally do for my male freinds, including giving him rides, cooking for him, buying him gifts, letting him have 24/7 access to me and supporting him in ways i shouldn't. Like dropping 400 on a ebike to help him get to where he needs to go for his birthday. meanwhile he was texting the girl who ghosted him on his birthday.  We never had sex but we came pretty close to doing it a couple times which im grateful it never happened because i would have become more attached. But its very obvious he has a crush her and loves the attention he gets from her.  The girl is a musician and an artist, so her profile is public, I just liked maybe like one of her posts because i admired her work and shes pretty, and left it at that. Facebook has an algorithm and it brings up more posts based on what you like, so yes i like some of her art so i could see more artists like her. I never commeted on anything, or messaged her.

A few days go by and she messaged him asking if he had a gf that he upset by commenting on her picture. He sent me a screenshot of the message and told me this is exactly why he kepted me blocked. Because he doesnt want his freinds feeling wierd from me stalking them. How she came to the conclusion i was his gf i have no idea, my profile is public so maybe she saw one of her pics together? Maybe because the likes came out of the blue she thought it was suspicious? idk. But he came at me all types of messed up about the situation, saying i keep crossing boundaries and don't rerspect his privacy, told me i need to back the fuck up off of her and him because shes not the one and he's not either. I woke up to this message after i tried calling him to tell him good morning.  of course he ignored my calls. he's saying im not his possesion, were not in a relationship and i have no right to comment on his freinds posts.

I replied even more angrily and told him that if he wants to have multiple girlfreinds he can, but dont blame me for when he caught. and that i have a right to do what i want on my facebook post, i never even commented on anything just liked 1 or 2 of her posts about art. He got it all wrong, if hed talked to me he would have gotten a better reaction but i was livid waking up to a mean message like that. I told him to leave me alone and blocked all communication. I am not really happy about where i am in life and im going throgh a lot, working hard to better myself and meet my goals. And ive just decided this is not the type of energy or freindship i need right now. He is closed off emotionally, hes not sweet, we have very different communication styles, i like to have deep conversations, hes very surface level, doesnt ask questions and doesnt ask about my mental and emotional well being. Dont get me wrong i enjoy his company, but spirtually and energetically we are not on the same frequency. Any kind of affection or sweetness is giving on his terms, not when I want it. And im just tired. building the life that i want is more important right now. He has an issue with looking like simp, and being vulnerable about his feelings with me. Might have something to do with his relationship trauma but, I just can't continue to have a freindship with someone who has a closed heart and I still sort of have feelings for him. He will never change or try to deepen our bond  He is usually always in a bad mood because hes healing and going through a big life transformation with being sober, which i understand. But still, there are men who are in his sobriety house who committed to sweet women within 2 or 3 months and there relationship is doing just fine. He says hes not like them hes not jumping into a relationship right now.

today i returned his jacket and all the other things hes given me outside his door. Knowing hi he will not reach out, i was always the one trying to mend things when he got into a fight, and I think this time he thinks I will come running back to chase him. But im not doing it anymore. I  understand avoidant people still need love and freindships. But whenever I tried to monitor my involvement or interactions and pull away thats when hed chase, make plans or blow up my phone and call me. Im tired of the push pull dynamic. Maybe in the future we can resume our freindship, but right now i just want space to focus on myself right now. Im a very loving an empathetic person and i think its because of this nuturing energy i attract ment who are unavailable emotionally But i cant do it anymore. I don't think i will be reaching out to feed his validation any further. If he wants to talk he has other ways he can reach me, but again i doubt it. Hes the king of detachment and hiding his true feelings. I don't think hes a bad person, hes not good for me right now. He needs to heal and unpack his relationship trauma and get over his ego of being soft and vulnerable, because my softness and kindness that i showed him needs to be reciprocated and fed and he just cant do that right now.

So my question is this, avoidant men who are aware of your issues, what goes through your head when a good woman finally walks away? Does it push you to examine yourself, your patterns and heal? Do you ever reach back out? Or do you just move on to the next girl, the next spark of excitment and start new surface level connections to ignore your pain? I don't want or expect him to come running after I'm asking because i really hope this guy will change and heal after this.",Happy_Paint_8098,Mixed signals,High

There's mutual respect, no power dynamic, etc. I feel safe around him, and I want to see if this goes somewhere.

t3_1qbo964,22M confused by mixed signals in a long-distance situation with 19F — am I asking for too much clarity?,"I’m a 22M and I’ve been talking to a 19F for a few months in a long-distance situation (about 300 km apart), and I’m feeling increasingly confused and emotionally drained by the mixed signals. From the start, we talked every day and built a strong emotional connection, but whenever I tried to understand where things were heading, she preferred to keep things undefined and said we should “take it step by step.” I was more direct about wanting clarity, while she often questioned my reactions and told me I was overthinking or being dramatic. A major moment happened when I traveled to her city after we talked about meeting; I planned everything and went there genuinely expecting to see her, but on the day itself she suddenly became distant, brought up old arguments, made excuses, and ultimately canceled last minute. That night turned into another emotionally confusing conversation instead of resolving anything. After that, she unfollowed me on Instagram first without saying anything, which hurt more than I expected given the long-distance nature of things. The next day, feeling overwhelmed, I unfollowed her back, and later that night she messaged asking why I unfollowed her and said that if I wanted to stop talking I should just say it and not play “weird games.” I explained that I wasn’t trying to send a message or manipulate her, just that I needed space to reset and that I would be honest if I wanted to walk away. Since then, any attempt to talk calmly about why the lack of consistency or the following issue bothered me turns into her asking why it matters so much or implying I’m reading into things again. She says she wouldn’t be talking to me if she had a boyfriend, but still remains emotionally distant and avoids defining anything. I care about her, but I feel like I’m constantly explaining myself, reassuring her, and adjusting my expectations while getting very little clarity in return. I’m trying to figure out whether this is normal early-stage uncertainty in dating, especially long-distance, or a sign that we’re simply not aligned. Should I keep being patient and give this more time, or is stepping back the healthier move here?",Efficient-Ocelot-28,Mixed signals,High
t3_1qcnvh2,In need of neurodivergent tips on living with your life partner/spouse/fiance during downtime when alone time is requested,"Ok this may be a little silly, childish and embarrassing but here goes. 

I, 27F have been living with my, 26M fiance for a little over a year. I am struggling to understand what living with your partner is supposed to look like. I have ADHD, am probabllly slightly on the autism spectrum and have pretty bad CPTSD and witnessed my late fiances murder when i was 21. This effects me pretty heavily still and many ways (worry not, yes i am in the therapies and take proper medication) and is a big reason i havent had a serious relationship through most of my 20's. I tend to lean towards codependency and have been described as clingy ive learned. I have always been hyper independent and dont have much serious relationship history due to my earlier mentioned late fiance. So this is my first time living full time with my love, my life partner.

 Ive previously lived with different room mates, then my 2 best friends for 3 years very successfully. I dont have many expectations,  i like to be greeted when im coming home from work and vice versa, and we do our fair share of chores and we kiss each other goodnight, the normal stuff. What im struggling with is, when we both have downtime and he wants to do his own thing alone like play video games or what have you, no biggie, i cant seem to find motivation to go do one of my hobbies or interests or hang with my friends and end up doom scrolling or dissociating at a wall. 

BUT when hes at work on my days off im all up in my hobby room, out there doin the most. Why cant i seem to seperate myself from him whens hes at home to do my own thing? Its hard to explan but if hes home i just want to be near him at all times, im clingy i know, im workin on it. Sooooooo

Im lookin for tips on how to healthily cohabitate with your partner during downtime when alone time is requested or even when to recognize i need my own alone time! Thank you 🥺🤍",future__corpsee,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1qbmezv,What should I do?,"So there’s this girl let’s call her E. She’s older than me by 8 years and I’m currently in South Korea for work (my home country is America) she lives here in South Korea and I meet here while I was bored and looking for girls to hang out with to kill some time. Well what was supposed to be a one date kinda thing has now turned into multiple dates and has lead to us hang out almost every weekend. I’ll stay at her place and we’ll grab food or just do activity’s together. The problem is I’m not gonna be here very long and because of her age she’s very locked in with the company’s she works for now so if things went any further like us getting into a relationship it would eventually either result in long distance (which I hate) or ending things abrubplty because I have to leave. Problem is I keep telling myself I’m okay with that. Even though we’re not in relationship we still do all the things a normal couple would do, give each other gifts, intimate, stay at each others places, and text each other all day. Even though I keep telling myself it’s gonna end and it’ll eventually lead to know where my heart still hurts a little. The thing is I’m not sure if it’s because she knows I’m going to leave soon and is okay with it or if it’s because I wish things were different. The other thing is, with her age why is she completely okay with just being a fling. How come she doesn’t want more? I want it to be strictly just fun and casual but she looks at me sometimes with sparky eyes and I catch my mind wandering to questions like “what if we did date.”",Caleman03,Power imbalance,High

t3_1q6n6i9,Are these red flags? Or blatant ignorance?,"im copy and pasting something i wrote for another sub, and adding onto that.

I’m 18F, my boyfriend is 20M, 21 in April. We are together but not fully since he hasn’t asked me out, but we dont really have a label and are just romantic with each other and are committed to each other. We are long distance and we both planned on making things officially official whenever he came down. He’s chronically ill so he can’t travel due to his doctors request.

Recently, things have felt different. I don’t really feel drawn to him. I don’t have a big desire to text him or call. However, I still put in effort to text and call as quickly as possible. I spent $300+ on him for Christmas (giftcards, personalized build-a-bear with my voice, handwritten notes, etc.) and be there for him. But I dont think I am in love with him anymore.

I dread calling, I get annoyed with him quickly (I will share why), he embarrasses me, and I sometimes feel like I am taking care of a child.

Here are some of the things I think made me loose attraction;

1). I like clingy, but he is extremely clingy. He will text me at school and work, no problem, but when I am out with friends, he will text me, spam me practically. I will open my phone to fifteen messages. Its embarrassing.

I was with my friend from the Navy last week. We got lunch. I never see him so this was special to me. I told my partner we would be together from 1-4. He ran a bit late, I kept him in check throughout. The whole time he texted me repeatedly, even though it was wholesome, innocent stuff, he knew I wouldn’t be on my phone since I was with my friend but continued to spam me. Repeatedly saying how excited he was for me to get home so we can call.

I sent a picture of my dog as a reaction to something, a picture I took days prior. He said, “Oh, you’re home!” Even though I had been with my friend for 40 minutes at that point. And then made an excuse that Life360 showed that I was no longer at the restaurant and at home. Strange :/

2). He “forgets” boundaries, then gets upset / disappointed when they are implemented. I’m a big girl, I’m not afraid to set my rules and boundaries. There are things I made clear make me uncomfortable, or I dont like. He listens but then sometimes I will bring something up as a reminder that I do not like it, and he genuinely has said things such as “Oh, I thought you \*did\* like it” or “I thought this changed” or something of the sort. Then when I say, “No, it hasn’t,” the mood switches and he becomes disappointed, and the good vibes we had going on deplete. He pouts, sulks, and it genuinely makes me want to scream.

3). He lacks common sense. He never puts two-and-two together and it’s frustrating. It could be something basic, not confusing at all. Such as when my therapist cancelled my appointment and I commented out loud about it, and he said “Wait, so is therapy canceled or is it not? I’m SO confused.” And I have to explain that… yes, it is canceled. I just said. I know this sounds like I am mean. I don’t usually have problems explaining things when needed, but when its constant and about things that should take no more than two working neurons to figure out, I grow tired.

4). He makes jokes that are insensitive. Theres so many examples for this. We used to have a very tough past, I don’t even want to bring it up. But let’s just say, he fucked up once, then twice, then a third time. I had lost feelings for him and he was devastated. Sometimes when he brings up how I lost feelings then a while later regained them, he’ll explain his inner thoughts as: “I was like, ‘fucking finally! took you long enough’”. He does this constantly, without taking into acc that I lost feelings due to the stuff he put me through.

5). He wants to call constantly, which isn’t a problem, but I am busy. I work, I do school, I do art and writing which is time consuming, and I keep up with the house. There are some days where I don’t feel good because I am physically exhausted + I’m on a new medicine and it makes me nauseous and more exhausted than usual. Sometimes I have to tell him, “Hey, I can’t call today.” A change of plans can be triggering for me to but a lot of times his response is dry, his tone changes and he acts like I wont talk to him for the rest of the day. It reminds me of a needy child, and makes me feel like I’m not entitled to time off.

Speaking of which… we quite literally had to have a lengthy conversation about me having one or two days a week where we don’t call so I can have alone time. He’s incredibly understanding but he’s passive aggressive, and said that I ignore him for hours, etc., and it upsets him. I never do those things ever. He sometimes says things in the moment when he is upset that is 100% not true and leaves me baffled, and then apologizes when I tell him that.

6). He makes jokes about being a stalker-ex. Calling me off different numbers, coming to my house and work. He’s “joking” but he also knows I struggle with MH badly and have bad paranoia, yet jokes about invading my personal autonomy and increasing my paranoia more. Is this disrespect, ignorance, or is he just not being considerate?

7). He is careless sometimes. He has had maybe three new jobs in the past couple of months. He does great, then gets bored, and either doesn’t show up at all or calls out even though he can’t call out for a certain amount of times since he is a new worker, and gets fired. I think this is immature. I value work a lot, I value being professional a lot as well. He sometimes calls out because of his stomach, but a lot of times he calls out, or doesn’t show simply because. I hate this. He laughs about it but I honestly cringe and shake my head because he’s setting a poor example of himself. 

8). This one is kinda TMI. we used to have a sexual dynamic. It was pretty strong. Just a lot of back-and-forth stuff on the phone or off the phone like on text. During that time we weren’t really together, but it was the same kind of thing where we were committed. We separated for a bit because we were having issues that became friends again and then when we became romantic again, I didn’t wanna have a sexual relationship. This was for plethora of reasons one of them being I just didn’t feel secure yet. He told me this later on, but he nearly broke up with me over it because it was something we “bonded over.” this hurt a lot, especially since he’s known that I have grown up being groomed, exploited and being with people who are hypersexual. My ex who would tell his friends that you have to practically beg me to do stuff. I was a child. I never thought this was right because we never had actual intimacy in in real life. Just a bunch of bullshit over the phone. I told him that his reason to break up with me over us not having fun sex and what not was ridiculous and he understood but I just don’t think this is how normal people would respond to that especially if their partner has had some kind of sexual trauma or bad sexual memories.

9). he says I’ve said stuff or done stuff. I’ve never done before. This is kind of tricky because I feel like he might accidentally paint a narrative or maybe heard something and thought that I said it but still it feels weird. An example of this; we often sleep on the phone just to have a little bit of extra time together. There was one night where I muted right as I put my phone down until I woke up. My phone is locked when I put it down so unless I touch it and unlock it, I can’t unmute myself. The next morning he said I was making such cute sounds when I slept and I immediately kind of thought this was stupid, and laughed a little bit and told him I was muted the whole time. I found this one because it feels like I kind of caught him red-handed. It sounds kind of mean, but that’s how I felt. He instantly was like “no I swear you were unmuted. I was hearing things.” or something like that and I’m like “nope I was muted the whole time.” 

And occasionally, this has been a repeated issue where he says that I’ve said things that I’ve never said. Try saying that three times lol. I’m neurodivergent and at times I’m really blunt, and sometimes my tone can be a little bit mean I feel like. When he says stuff that I clearly have never said before because 1). It’s not something I would usually say, or 2). It doesn’t spark any recollection of me ever saying it. I will say something like “what are you talking about? I’ve never said that before.” which sounds kind of harsh but honestly, I get annoyed hearing things repeatedly that never have happened. He’ll think he’s in the right for a bit until I repeatedly tell him I never said that and then he’ll apologize and be like “oh, I’m sorry I really thought you said that.” is this normal? I feel like this could be an innocent mistake, but it happens a lot. ",ttiramisulover,General consent ambiguity,Medium
t3_1q7m57v,have i ruined it?,"hey there! i (30F) am currently 28 weeks pregnant and am not with my ex, whom is the dad. toxic relationship that just isn’t working. there is someone (32M) that i have known since before i got pregnant (met online back in the summer while the ex and i were on one of our many “breaks”). this person has been a constant source of reassurance and someone to talk to as they have their own drama surrounding their son. just has been nice having them as a friend. we’ve attempted to hangout multiple times and it never worked out. we’d go weeks without talking and then pick things back up again just as a “check in” and periodically have had deep convos. but we were both in on again off again things ourselves so didn’t always talk. there’s always been an undeniable connection. so finally, i was in town for christmas and we got dinner christmas eve. it went great but due to family obligations, it was only about 2 hours. they asked if i could hangout again on saturday evening. i went to dinner with them again and went to their place afterwards to watch a movie. it got late, we laid down, and tried to go to sleep…and then it happened. i instantly had this internal freakout because what if i just messed it all up by that happening?! well that was almost two weeks ago and we’ve been talking heavy everyday. but now i feel like it is going towards the tapering off direction. im not normally one to truly like someone out of connection and not just convenience (aka like it was with my ex), but i really like them and we are very compatible.

i guess my question is…did sleeping with them ruin it? what is my next step? i’m torn between putting my walls up and just focusing on this pregnancy, even if it means letting things go with this amazing person, or making this work…but i don’t know what to do. very complex situation.",motherof-furrybabies,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1q7sgqe,Feeling brushed off while he’s on a trip,"I’ve been seeing someone going on 7 months now. He’s currently on a trip this week, which is a big deal for him as he goes every year and invests heavily into it.

This week has been stressful for me with school stress, a health scare which resulted in going to the hospital early in the morning and other personal stuff. When I tried to tell him that my week hasn’t been great, it wasn’t really acknowledged. For the most part, whenever I explain that my day isn’t going well, it tends to get brushed aside. But on the other hand, if he has an issue whether it’s personal, work or health related I immediately try to be encouraging, offer solutions, or help him work through it even if I don’t exactly relate to his struggle I try to be empathetic. 

I feel even a small message of support would have been fine, like “hope you’re okay” or “that sounds rough” just something to show he heard me. Instead, the conversation just shifted immediately back to his trip and what he’s doing today. It really hurt to feel like my struggles weren’t being recognised.

I tried to make myself feel better by doing things I normally enjoy, but it fell flat and I ended up breaking down on the way home in public. Later, he messaged asking if I was okay and told me he was going to dinner. I replied with “I’m doing okay, but for now I need space” and “enjoy your dinner.” I needed space because I knew that if I tried to communicate while in my state of mind, I might say something I’d regret later on.

He’s not due back until the weekend, and I’m unsure how or when to explain my feelings to him. Should I wait until he’s back? How do I communicate this without it turning into an argument?",No_Crab5612,General consent ambiguity,Medium

t3_1q51htg,Should I stay?,"For context, my boyfriend knows I don’t do drugs often, the only time I’ve smoked is a few times with him, and before I had some edibles that were 5-10mg only, therefore my tolerance to weed is low. A few days ago, he offered me an edible asking if I want to share it with him and so I did. At first I felt okay, but then the next thing I know I was laying in bed panicking and hallucinating. Everything was disoriented, including his face, my room, and his speech. I couldn’t even lift up my head. It was a really scary experience, so I asked him how much he gave me and he said 50mg🤯. I was shocked because that is 5x the normal amount I took, and he never told me it was 50mg this time. I was also moving a lot and shaking. He tried to help me through and comfort me through the whole weed panick attack situation, but whenever he would touch me(put his leg and arms on me) it felt like he was putting a lot of pressure due to overstimulation from the drugs. Eventually I told him to go away, and I minimized the shaking to only blinking and scratches, but to him that meant he could go to sleep(which he did) I woke up to him apologizing for giving me the edible, but I still felt betrayed that he fell asleep to that, and the fact he gave me 50mg knowing I have a low tolerance.

t3_1q4y2t5,"32 year old male, never had a relationship living in a big city in Germany","Hey dear Reddit Community,

I am came on this subreddit because I am currently in a situation which I cant explain myself and I am really puzzled and a bit desperate.

As the title says, I am 32 years old and never had a girlfriend, even though in the last 11 years I went on 50-100 dates (it is not as much because I have been SINGLE all the time).I work in a media company in Germany, have a stable job and actually enjoy it. I am not weird, shy , or have social anxiety. I have no problem talking to people or socializing.

I am not a virgin, I also had sex with quiet a few of the women, but ALL women always say ""Sorry, you're a cool guy but I didn't feel a spark"".

How is it possible ? Of course there can't always be a chemistry between everyone.. but 50-100 dates and no single woman? This cleary looks like a pattern to me. I met almost all women in online dating, or through approaching in bars or student parties during university time

The problem is that I couldn't identify it and it makes me really frustrated because most of my friends in my age had already relationships , and some are even getting married and having kids. I wish I could be a father soon too but right now its so far away.

If I could just find out whats hindering me I could fix the issue. But its not easy at all because there could be thousand reasons if someone never had a girlfriend or doesnt inicite a spark that makes it very dificult.

I am a pretty normal guy I am not socially weird, I have friends, I leave my house.

Is it maybe a mental / psychological issue? maybe I have some attachment disorder I am not aware off?? but even then there could be millions of disorder. Is it even an issue for the doctor? I was thinking of going to a psychiatrist/ or psychologist, but what can I say ""I cant get a girlfriend, can you help me?"" thats not their business.

I already asked friends what they thought is the issue. they didnt know and couldnt explain it. Also I once asked a woman after a date. she said nothing really, it just didnt match.She cant explain it either I didnt give off the vibe of like a guy that never had a girlfriend or where she thought hmm he is weird thats why he had not a girlfriend. just a normal dude.

I hope I can use the swarm intelligence to make hypothesisses what are the most likely causes , so I can tacke the problem.

It really sucks. what did they mean by ""the spark"" ??  I get it that you cant have a spark with everyone, but 50-100 women said the same thing??

t3_1q0sqc1,Is friendship after one date normal?,"I went on one date with someone a while back. He was really nice and we got on well but there wasn’t a romantic spark. We both realised it early on and stayed in touch as friends. Sometimes we meet for a drink or two, but we don’t message every day and our plans are spontaneous. Boundaries are clear it’s strictly friendship. I personally believe that if someone doesn’t harm me and is genuinely a nice person then there’s no reason to end a friendship just because the date didn’t work out. I’ve been talking to another guy since October, and I understand his point, but he still finds it strange that I’m friends with someone I went on one date with. I’m curious how others see this. Is staying friends after a single date like this generally considered normal or is it unusual? How much of it comes down to personal boundaries? Any advice how to approach.

t3_1q47xcr,He loves texting but never wants to hangout. ????,"Hi so I (19F) have been seeing this dude (21M) for roughly 2 months, nothing serious, we’re not “together”. But in those two months, i’ve only seen him like two times! I’ve try inviting him out, he says he wants to but makes up a bullshit excuse. I can’t tell if he’s mentally ill or disinterested. We text every day, but he just never wants to hangout… just wants to text. I’ll invite him to get drinks, he’ll say no because he’s “tired”. I asked him to Facetime, he stayed on for maybe 10 minutes. Every time we’ve hung out it’s just been to the movies, then he says he “needs to be up early”then he goes home. Like what? And it’s not like hes mean, disrespectful, or has given me any red flags. He’s genuinely like my dream boy except he’ll look for any excuse to not hangout or be outside the house. he’s made it abundantly clear he’s not talking to other girls. Every time i get suspicious or like a weird feeling, miraculously he’ll text me a video of him at home playing video games. It’s like the universe is stringing me along.. not even him. He’s super sweet, and i want him really bad, but is that normal?? to almost never see someone you’re dating??? i’m starting to get sick of it. What do i do? How do i confront it? I’m not his girlfriend but i’d like to be eventually but things are moving EXCRUCIATINGLY slow. I’m a very social person and love leaving my house, so this has been torture.

t3_1pz8b3d,Help with my Girlfriend (M18) &amp; (F18),"TLDR: Struggling to do plans I made with GF because of bad memory and looking for help.

Hello people, I wanted to make this post because I would really appreciate some help with my relationship. I've been having issues with my 1.2 year, semi-long distance girlfriend, stemming from myself and my poor planning and execution skills.

Basically I've always had a bad memory, and a lot of the time Ive struggled to get things done because of it. With certain things like appointments, putting them into my calendar on my phone has helped. But recently Ive just been struggling with more casual events. A few days ago I bought us a couple multiplayer games and I was really excited to see her reaction and for us to play them, but besides the first game I bought us where we had a blast, we haven't really touched the second one after nights of us saying we will.

I made an effort to say that we'd play the second one and we'd also watch a movie at some point, and she agreed happily, but after the past couple days of us both being free in the evenings, the day has just passed along and it ends up becoming too late for us to do anything except saying goodnight and going to bed. The reason why this sucks and is very frustrating for her is because when my friends ask to hangout, its cool and we hang out. And happily my girl is very supportive of me hanging out with my friends which is normal. But its frustrating because I end up doing things with my friends, but I struggle to do planned things with her. And that time and the nights we have plans, end up wasting away because I forget. We do still call during times of the day, and we do text often. But the night time is when we'd usually game and watch stuff, and that's been the time I've been struggling to do these plans.

The thing is, these things with my Girlfriend are very important to me. Very important. And my struggle to do these events upsets and frustrates me as well. I want to show her she is my priority and she is special in my life, which she very much is. Another layer to it, is the stuff I end up doing with my friends usually doesn't have much substance to it, and could be done anytime because they're fairly free.

How can I improve on myself and help this situation? Could my girlfriend help at all? Just any advice would just be amazing..",No_Barber_5425,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1pydzir,She “blocked me” from her IG storys,"I’ve been dating this girl for a few months. We live very far from each other, so it’s long distance. We’re not exclusive, but we’ve seen each other twice and things have been genuinely good. Communication is regular but not constant. Some weeks we talk every day, other weeks we don’t talk for a few days.. Recently, she traveled to be with her family. Communication dropped a bit, which again, didn’t really bother me. But then I noticed something odd: she suddenly removed all her Instagram highlights, and I could see the story ring on her profile on comments, but when I clicked, it was just black. No story visible.

Out of curiosity (and yeah, maybe not my proudest moment), I checked from another account and confirmed that she is posting stories, just excluding me from seeing them.

Now, I want to be clear: I don’t think this means she’s doing something “wrong.” We’re not exclusive. She doesn’t owe me full transparency. I’m not mad or jealous.

 I don’t think she owes me anything since we’re not exclusive. But I’m 33, and in my experience, people usually hide stories when they don’t want someone to see what they’re doing, especially in a dating context.

I was planning to travel again in January to see her, and I’m trying to decide whether this is a red flag worth paying attention to, or just normal behavior in a non-exclusive, long-distance situation.

Would appreciate honest opinions",[deleted],Alcohol/substances,High
t3_1py5cfx,"Matched with a woman on Hinge, but something feels a bit off","Hi all, looking for some outside perspective because I’m not great at reading these things and don’t want to ignore potential red flags or unfairly judge someone.

I matched with a woman on Hinge recently and we had a phone call pretty early on. The call lasted close to 1.5–2 hours. A lot of the conversation involved her talking about difficult things she’s been through. Addiction, family issues, past relationship stuff. I did feel like we connected, but afterward I also felt a little uneasy, like maybe the conversation went very deep very fast. I’m not sure where the line is between healthy vulnerability and trauma dumping, and I’m wondering if this might have crossed it.

We made tentative plans to see each other, but there was a misunderstanding about timing. She thought I’d be back in town earlier than I actually was. When that came up, she seemed pretty upset. She later said she was “just joking” and ribbing me, but it felt more like she was genuinely annoyed and then tried to play it off.

More recently, I tried to make plans again. She said she’d be too tired one night and suggested another. I said I already had plans that night (dinner with a friend), and she pressed a bit about what I was doing. Then she said something like, “maybe you have another date.” That made me uncomfortable since we haven’t even gone out yet. None of this is extreme on its own, but taken together it’s making me feel a bit off. I can’t tell if this is just early-dating awkwardness and miscommunication, or signs of insecurity/boundary issues/moving too fast emotionally.

For people who’ve dated more or have experience with this kind of thing: Does this sound like early red flags? Or is this within the range of normal and I’m overanalyzing? If you were in my position, would you slow things down, address it directly, or move on?

Appreciate any honest perspectives, especially from people who’ve been on either side of situations like this.",DarkOfTheSun,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1pvpyln,Feeling numb in a healthy relationship,"I (25F) started dating my friend of 4 years (26M). He confessed that he’s been having feelings for me for a while. He has confessed to me and i realize that I find him attractive and I was slowly developing a crush on him the more we talked daily. 

He’s been nothing but a green flag, plans dates, takes notes of little details, communicates very well, very affectionate, kind, funny, etc. I slowly realize that he was way deep in his feelings for me, and i think i’m slowly falling out of love, and I know it’s stupid, because I know being in a long term partnership, especially healthy ones, are bound to feel “boring” and loses its spark, but i just have this feeling that he has stronger feelings than I do, and i’m hoping i’ll get over it and my feelings for him will return. i love him, and i just want to be in love with him.

t3_1pupddb,Am I a Red Flag?,"33M, I've had several short term relationships lasting up to a few months. I've gone on countless first dates at this point and no girl explicitly says it, but is it a red flag that I've never been in a serious long term relationship? I feel like a girl sees me on the surface as a normal, successful guy and wonders what's wrong with me, even if I give them a good reasonable answer. 

  
For context, I am a doctor about to complete my training in June. So up until 5 years ago, although I've always wanted a girlfriend, I wasn't actively seeking/dating seriously since I wanted to focus on my career. My life was also constantly in flux since I didn't know where I would end up next. For example, in college I wasn't sure I would even get into medical school, I didn't know where I would match residency or fellowship etc. In hindsight I shouldn't have cared about this and realized I would make it work with the right person. I just didn't want to fall for someone then potentially have to make that choice (career vs. relationship). 



Since I started dating with intention in residency (since I was 27), I'd chalk it all up to just not finding the right match, sometimes on her end sometimes on mine. I'm just not the type of guy to string a girl along for convenience until I find someone new/better for me. If I'm not feeling it, I'll end things instead of leading them on.

  
Would appreciate any advice, particularly from women. It feels like if this is a red flag, how could I even dig myself out. It's like applying for your first job and they want prior experience, even though you feel you check every other box.",radDO24,General dating / relationship,Low

I am 18 and she is 16 turning 17 and we’ve been talking ever since July we’ve been talking so good and had great chemistry we felt the Sparky immediately we kept on talking for months then we finally decided to meet up at a movie theater everything was going well. I will never forget we met, and we hugged. She hugged my mother on the neck when she first met her ,that day she made the first move. And laid on my shoulder, I wasn’t complaining. I loved it then I laid on her head should be normal right we hugged and said goodbye after that day everything changed she wasn’t talking as much. She was just basically ignoring me.

I’m always the one given an effort now it feels like and usually she isn’t like this then I noticed a change in her mood like I’m just annoying at this point, which I don’t text her like three times every second I text once wait even if it takes 12 hours which it hasn’t yet I feel like she’s only there to vent at me she tells all about her, but she never ask about me and it hurts.

t3_1ppbmyq,I (20F) have been getting so frustrated with my boyfriend (21M) and I can't tell if I'm being overbearing or if he isn't trying hard enough. What can I do to get us back on track?,"Hello! This is a throw away account because I don't want my boyfriend to see this. I've never posted on Reddit, but any advice is appreciated.

Here's the backstory:

Sam (boyfriend) and I met in college through mutuals and started off just as friends, but then started dating 2nd semester our freshman year (we are now juniors). He basically lived in my dorm with my because that's what our other friends were doing at the time and because I was going through really bad family issues at the time and needed the emotional support. Everything was great with us, but long story short I had awful roommate issues so Sam and I basically didn't come out of my room except to go to class. The next year I moved into an apartment with a friend, but the tried to OD and had to be taken out of school and moved home. Sam basically lived with me this whole time too. This coupled with the family stuff led to me being depressed. I feel like until this semester I've just been depressed and barely getting by, but Sam was super helpful and great.

During this time Sam was with me 24/7 which he still is and I so appreciate. I really appreciate how much he was there for me when I was struggling. He would take out the trash and help me with laundry whenever I asked. He would help me with my assignments at 3 in the morning. He would come to doctors appointments with me. He would bring me food if I didn't want to leave the house. He drove me six hours to visit my friend in the hospital. He treats my cats like he gave birth to him. I want to emphasize that he is really a great guy.

Probably important info: I pay my tuition, my parents pay my rent, and I have a substantial amount in my savings. His parents pay his rent and tuition and he doesn't have access to his savings account only his parents do.

So now this semester:

I'm working and going to school and I'm actually doing really well for the first time in a while. His grades are fine, but I feel like all he does is sit in bed all day and its starting to make me mad because I feel like I'm doing something all the time and he's just always at home. I'm also a neat freak, but when I was depressed that is one of the things I wasn't freaking out about. I

have an extensive list of chores I do once a week, which I feel is totally normal, and he wasn't doing any of it even though he was always staying at my place. This caused a big fight because I always mentioned in passing but he never did it. Eventually I got fed up and forced him to sit down with me where I made of list of every chore I do and made him split it with me 50/50. I let him pick the days he wanted to do the chores he chose, and we made a calendar. Probably solved right? No. Now when the days roll around I have to remind him to do the chores, or he'll say can I do it tomorrow or he'll do a half ass job. I absolutely hate having to ask him to make the bed or do the laundry or take me to dinner or take out the trash. He doesn't get why I lose my mind about it, but I don't know why I have to ask ever. We literally have a chart that he participated in making. He signed up to always be on trash duty. I shouldn't have to say dude the trash is full again take it out every single time. I just feel like if I've already asked you to make the bed when you're the last one out of it you should do it every time because you know it bothers me.

I also recognize that it is exhausting for him when I get home and I have a list of complaints, but I just get so upset and I don't know how to deal with it. I feel like I'm ruining our whole relationship because I correct him every single day, but if I get home and the bed isn't made and the laundry basket is full after I reminded you yesterday that those things upset me, then I have a right to be mad. We've talked about it calmly so many times, I've yelled at him about it a few times. I hate bringing it up every day. He hates that I bring it up every day. I feel like bringing it up is causing our problems. I don't know what to do.

Extra Issue I could use help with:

This is also totally a me problem, but I don't know how to fix it. It makes me upset that he has nothing to worry about. I have all of this family stuff going on and I'm so beyond stressed about money and I could have a breakdown about it every day, but he literally has nothing to worry about ever. His mom does everything for him and it makes me unreasonably upset. I know its because I'm jealous but how do I stop feeling like that.

t3_1ppet2j,Most Dating Advice Is Lying To You (Here Are 4 Hard Truths),"A lot of dating advice for men and manosphere talking points are dead wrong. Today I want to break down 7 pieces of dating “wisdom” you’ve probably heard before and explain why they’re mostly bullshit. If any of these surprise you…good. That usually means it’s worth reading.  
  
**1) Dating hasn’t “gotten worse” the way people think**  
  
There’s this popular belief that dating was great for hundreds of years… and only recently went to shit. That’s factually false.  
  
In the 1700s, Jane Austen was writing about women choosing charming, unreliable men over stable ones, long before dating apps  
  
In the 1800s, people didn’t “ghost”… they deserted. It was so common that newspapers ran ads from abandoned spouses trying to locate partners who literally vanished, changed their name, and remarried.  
  
In the 1900s, Dear John letters were normal. Women regularly ended marriages by mail while their husbands were overseas at war.  
  
People have always cheated. People have always made selfish choices. People have always had their hearts broken. Some people also had great marriages, just like today.  
  
A lot of guys romanticize the 1950s, but here’s the reality. You often married the first girl you slept with. Ask yourself honestly, would you want to marry the first girl you ever slept with? For me, that’s a hard no.  
  
Women were also deeply unhappy in many cases, medicated at massive levels, and expected to suffer quietly. (If you want a good depiction of this, watch Revolutionary Road.)  
  
Technology changed. Human nature didn’t.  
  
**2) Dating apps didn’t ruin dating**  
  
Before apps, people dated coworkers, friends, church members, classmates, or neighbors. It wasn’t that people behaved better — they just had fewer options.  
  
Dating apps didn’t make people selfish or disloyal. They revealed who already was. More choice exposes: Who lacks loyalty, who chases novelty, and who doesn’t know what they want  
  
That’s not an app problem. That’s a human problem. Apps are a magnifying glass, not a poison. If apps truly “ruined dating”:  
  
a) Attractive, socially savvy men wouldn’t succeed on them  
  
b) Women wouldn’t form relationships through them  
  
c) People would have abandoned them entirely - and no, Tinder showing a user drop doesn’t mean people quit dating apps. They switched. Hinge, for example, has grown 38% year-over-year, along with many niche apps.  
  
The real problem isn’t apps.  
  
For men, it’s not understanding photos, messaging, and how to set dates.  
  
For women, it’s not knowing how to communicate what they want and effectively screening out guys who don’t want the same thing  
  
Apps work if you understand human nature instead of fighting it.  
  
**3) Women don’t communicate nearly as well as they think**  
  
There’s this cultural assumption that women are “better communicators.” Not exactly.  
  
Women tend to communicate emotion – how they feel in the moment. Men tend to communicate information – facts about the situation. And both sides are terrible at translating for the other.  
  
Communication is a skill that needs to be developed for both men and women. One of the biggest causes of poor communication and relationship issues in general is a lack of self-awareness.  
  
People simply don’t realize how their behavior affects the other person and are incapable of truly putting themselves in the other person’s shoes. And that’s the hidden cause of a lot of failed marriages and relationships  
  
**4) People who “won’t settle” usually end up alone**   
  
There is no perfect partner. Every relationship has trade-offs. The goal isn’t perfection... it’s fit. Who shares your values? Who adds far more to your life than they subtract?  
  
Red-pill guys obsess over cooking and cleaning, but those are trivial. You can pay someone to do your chores. But you can’t pay someone to make you feel loved, someone to grow with, someone who will be by your side no matter what. Those are the things that actually determine long-term happiness.

t3_1pobhc0,I've been romantically interested in my best friend for over 2 years. What the hell do I do now??,"I (21-NB, female presenting bisexual) have been interested in my closest friend (23F, lesbian) since November of 2023. We're both at Uni together, same course - I graduate in 2026, her in 2027. 

We're both pathetic fucking losers with basically no relationship experience (I """"""dated"""""" a different person when I was 13/14 but we never even kissed... And that's the only romantic experience both me and my friend have to speak of) and are both pretty disillusioned from the typical 'uni life', in that we don't go clubbing, drink, or hook up. We both have similar experiences with mental illness, gender, and family dynamics - I've never met someone I've identified with so much. We're so different and yet so similar. She's been my biggest support during difficult situations, and she's come to me first with her own situations as well. I struggle with vulnerability, but with her, I'm more comfortable than I am with any other friends - and with the way she changes when we're alone together, I think she feels the same. 

I love being pathetic together. I'd love to continue living my life with her, living our own version of normal and accepting and appreciating each other regardless of our quirks. Even if it were to end, I'd like to think we'd have made a positive influence on each other. 

But I'm so scared that asking her out might drive us apart. 

There's so many conflicting thoughts. I want to keep making her happy - best case scenario, we could make each other's lives happier as a couple, but worst case scenario, I'll make her upset and drive her away. It terrifies me to think that I could ask her out and get rejected, and watch our friendship fall apart... Or that I never ask her out and potentially regret it for the foreseeable future. Not knowing is killing me, but knowing the response is rejection could kill our friendship. And I'm at a total loss on what to do. 

There's nothing I've noticed to suggest she's romantically interested in me, but I'm terrible at interpreting social cues and reading between the lines. There's been a few times in the past 2 years where I've made vaguely flirty remarks but I couldn't tell whether her reactions were flustered or cringed. As I say, I'm terrible at reading people. To make matters worse, I know from her own personal anecdotes that she's not much better! We both suck!!

I'm also scared of asking her out face-to-face. The last thing I want to do is put her in an uncomfortable situation in which she feels she can't escape easily. But then, confessing over text isn't seen in a positive light, and I'd probably stress myself silly before seeing her again, regardless of her response. 

If I were to get rejected, I know I'd be able to move on without issue - I have the sort of brain that lets me move on immediately if someone I have feelings for is, 1) Not interested, or 2) Already spoken for. But I don't know how she'd react, which is concerning. We also have a shared friend group (being in the same class and all) and I don't want to drag them down too. 

Shit, this is just really complicated and confusing to navigate. I really need some advice on, just generally, what to do. I feel like I've tried everything except the obvious, but I don't know if it's worth it. ",ThrowRA_birdbrain,Mixed signals,High
t3_1pnqc8g,Never been in relationship and need help with this guy I’m talking to,"Never been in a relationship and I need help with this guy I’m talking to

Okay, so I’m 19F and have never been in a relationship. I recently met this guy, and we’ve been talking a little over a month now. He’s very kind and respectful and we share the same values. Anyway, I really like him a lot and we’ve had conversations about this moving forward to a relationship. (Side note, I am shipping out for basic training In less then two months, I feel like I should throw that in there for a little more context, he says he’s okay with long distance because he really likes me, even though it will be a challenge, he said he’s willing to make that commitment) So, I kind of have 3 different questions, so forgive me if this is long.
  
  1. Last night we were talking over the phone, which we do most nights, and we always fall asleep. So at about 4:30 in the morning, I heard two notifications go off that sounded like the dating app we met on, which we had both said we deleted. I kind of wrote it off for a minute because I was half asleep but then I think he may have put himself on mute. I’m not positive but it seemed like it. Now, I know we aren’t officially dating just yet, but I don’t want to be with someone who lies to me at all.

2. If u can get past the first one, which I’m kind of nervous about lol, I also wonder why he takes a while to reply sometimes. He tells me good morning every day, and we talk on the phone most nights, but is it normal for him to take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour to respond? Like even when he’s not really doing anything. I’ve been told that if a guy likes you he always responds fast, but I also feel like constant fast communication throughout the entire day is a little much, but I’ve never talked to a guy prior to this so I have no idea. He doesn’t typically go longer than an hour unless he’s hunting or at the shooting range where there’s no signal. 


3.okay and last one. So I really like making people things, and it was his birthday a couple weeks ago so I made him a painting of Alaska because we’d talked about how we both would want to go there someday. He really liked it, at least it seemed like he did, unless he’s just a really good actor lol. I also baked him cookies at one point as well which he ate a lot of lol. But now it’s almost Christmas, and I made him a wallet out of leather, which he knows about because I’m a bad liar and he can tell when I’m lying lol, and I also got him some beanies because he lost most of his, and I also got him a gun cleaning mat. Okay so my question is, is that too much? I don’t want him to think I’m love bombing him or being overly affectionate. But I just really like gifting people things. Like I make stuff for other people all the time. He did ask me what kind of jewelry I like and wanted reference photos so idk if he’s getting me something for Christmas too. But is my gifts too much?


I’m a really bad about overthinking too, so I just need some advice. He’s 23 btw. And he’s very mature and we are both Christian’s that share the same beliefs and values. We also share a lot of the same interests, and both are career driven.( he’s a pilot) he also lives a ways away from me but he works nearby which is why we met.

t3_1plz7a9,Why am I not into him?,"Hi everyone :)

I’m 25y/o woman, who has never been in a relationship. Recently, I had my 2nd date with this one dutch guy. He’s been very sweet, thoughtful and so gentle towards me. He makes me feel comfortable and his little affectionate actions do make me smile and shy away in a good way. But when we held hands or when he kissed me, I didn’t really feel anything. Like nothing at all…and I’m kinda mad at myself, that I can’t seem to develop a crush….or at least feel anything. (Not asexual, had one guy and I was head over heels for him..unfortunately)

After our date, I noticed that he’s more open towards me. He texts more and started sending selfies, but it kinda gives me a heavy feeling on my heart I guess? We do plan to have a 3rd date, which I’m actually very excited for, but I admit I think it’s more because of the activity than him…and I feel very bad for that, because I feel like he’s more emotionally invested while I’m just not. He even wants to introduce his friends to me on the 3rd date which kinda pressures me because I feel like I’m just getting to know him. The thing is also that I’m from Germany, so there is like 2-3h distance between us. Normally I really wouldn’t mind this…well if I really do like someone.

I’m just so confused, because he has been so lovely. Is it me? Since in my 25 years I had zero relationships? I’m not insecure about that, but I feel like it makes my dating life harder and kinda clouds my decision. My friends said that I should be more open and not so uptight.

Am I thinking too much into it? Because I tend to overthink the smallest things. Should I go on the 3rd date while already having these thoughts? I mean, it could develop into more? But I feel like that kinda sounds like excuses? I don’t know, I’m just the type who likes to be very genuine and honest, and I don’t want to lead someone on. Especially him. That’s why I’m writing here for the first time, because he’s really a great guy and I’m just in denial.",Glittering-Movie5113,General dating / relationship,Low

Looking for outside perspective / relationship advice

Note: it was LDR;

Me and my ex broke up almost 2.5 years ago (it’ll be 3 years soon). We broke up mainly because of religious differences.

After the breakup, there’s been a repeated cycle. She blocked me, then unblocked me. The first time she came back, we talked normally — no dry replies, proper conversations. Then out of nowhere, she blocked me again.

The second time she came back, we talked less, but it still didn’t feel dry. After some time, she blocked me again.

The third time she unblocked me, I was the one who reached out. I was just checking up on her. We started talking again, but this time the energy was different. Replies became dry and delayed. She’ll respond properly when something serious comes up, then go cold again.

Recently, she sent me pictures of herself in a new outfit and asked how it looked. I said it looked good. At the time, I didn’t know she was wearing it to go out later.

The next day, she told me about a guy in her class. She clearly said he likes her more than a friend, but she only wants him as a friend and doesn’t want to date him. She said he’s sure he wants her in his life, but he’s not making it easy for her to stay and also not letting her go.

She talked about this, and I gave her advice. After that, she said something like “okay, this is an eye-opener,” thanked me, and said bye. I replied casually, but she didn’t respond to my last message and the conversation ended there.

Because of that, and the overall dry behavior, I removed her from Instagram. There was no argument — it just felt like I was being ignored again, so I stepped back.

After 2–3 days, she messaged me again saying she suddenly felt anxious while studying. It wasn’t related to the other guy or any relationship issue. I helped calm her down.

Now I’m confused. The blocking/unblocking, the shift from normal conversations to dry replies, and the fact that she still comes to me when she’s anxious makes me wonder what role I actually play in her life after almost 3 years.

Am I just a safe emotional space for her? Is this unresolved attachment? Or am I dragging this out by staying available?

t3_1pisf1q,"Early long-distance connection — balancing interest, pacing, and realism, and how to stay grounded without pulling away (bit of a long post, tl;dr at bottom)","Hi all, posting from a throwaway and looking for perspective from people with lived experience in long-distance dynamics, especially in the early stages.

I’ve (20M) been talking daily with someone (21F) I met online for just under three weeks now. We’re in different countries with a noticeable time difference. What started spontaneously and really casually has turned into a surprisingly strong conversational connection; shared interests, humour, curiosity, and a really easy back-and-forth. The energy feels mutual and balanced: we both initiate (though she often enjoys starting it off), re-engage, and move through a wide field of topics, over long stretches. 

I’m trying to be intentional about how I handle this. I’m not looking to rush labels or treat this like a relationship before it’s maybe had any real-world grounding. At the same time, I know long-distance can drift into fantasy or over-investment if you’re not careful, especially when you’re talking every day, and it’s all new and exciting.

**Some additional context that feels relevant:**

\- We haven’t done voice or video *yet*. It’s all been text-based.

\- The conversation is more playful / nerdy / thoughtful than emotionally charged. We talk about art, philosophy, books, films, politics, random life stuff, etc.

\- There’s been some light, future-leaning humour (silly “date ideas,” movie-watching together once she fixes her VPN, etc.), but nothing explicit, heavy or pressured.

\- There *is* playful flirtation, including a light power dynamic in tone. She tends to be more teasing/assertive, and I play along more receptively (though it flips sometimes). It’s mutual, comfortable, and not explicitly sexual, but I can assume this kind of dynamic can increase emotional momentum quickly in long-distance settings.

\- We trade memes, music, and little personal details (she’s given me a nickname, we compare tiny cultural differences and similarities, niche interests, etc.), so it feels more “real” than just small talk.

\- A couple of friends have warned me about the honeymoon phase, one person catching feelings faster than the other, and generally talking loads to someone you’ve never met. And the risks of sustained connection without proximity.  I’m taking that on board, but I don’t want fear to run the show either.

One thing I’m wrestling with is the risk of misreading subtext. This is currently a text-only, cross-cultural situation, and while there’s warmth and can get very playful at times, I’m conscious that tone and intent can land very differently depending on communication style and context. I’m trying not to read \*too\* much into every message, but also not dismiss things that might actually be genuine interest.

What I’m really trying to figure out is what “healthy pacing” looks like here — not forcing it into something, but also not backing off so much that I strangle it out of anxiety or becoming emotionally centred on it too quickly.

Some specific questions I’d really appreciate insight on:

**Daily conversation:**  

Is daily texting early on inherently risky in long-distance situations, or does it depend more on tone, expectations, and independence than frequency?

**Calls:**

We’ve already half-joked about calls and watching a film together. Roughly when does it make sense to move to voice or video? Do earlier calls help ground things in reality, or do they usually just speed up attachment? And in your experience, does the dynamic over text normally carry over into calls?

**Emotional grounding:**

How do you stay open and present without letting one person you’ve never met become the main emotional focus of your day?

**Playful power dynamics:**

In early long-distance situations, if there’s some flirting and a bit of a “one teases / one receives” pattern, does that tend to intensify attachment in ways that are harder to manage at a distance? Any tips on keeping that fun but grounded?

**Intent clarity:** (this one’s big for me) 

How do you know when it’s okay to be a bit clearer that you’re interested, without putting weird pressure on things? Are there signs you look for before you say anything, or is it more of a gut feeling and seeing how they respond over time?

**Distance realism:**

When does it make sense to bring up the practical side (different continents, if/when you could ever meet, whether it’s realistically sustainable), without killing the vibe or making it feel like some big “what are we?” talk?

**Conclusion:**

I do understand that long-distance rarely works long-term without a plan to meet in person at some point. I’m not ignoring that. I’m just trying to find that balance between being open to where this could go and not completely losing the plot over someone I haven’t met yet.

We’re on different continents and there’s been no concrete plan to meet so far, though visiting her side of the world is something I’d realistically consider in the future if things kept developing.

Would really appreciate thoughts from people who’ve handled this well — or learnt the hard way when they didn’t. Thanks.

**TL;DR:** Been talking daily with a girl online (I’m 20M, she’s 21F) for just under three weeks. Different continents, strong connection, lots of humour, flirting and shared interests, but only text so far. I really like the vibe and it feels mutual, but I’m wary of getting carried away or misreading things.

Looking for advice on:  
– whether daily messaging this early is a problem,  
– when to move to calls,  
– how to stay emotionally grounded,  
– how to handle the flirty/power dynamic,  
– when it’s okay to be more open about my interest,  
– and when/how to talk about the reality of distance and meeting in person.",Lonely_Arachnid2570,Mixed signals,High
t3_1ple2tf,Unreciprocated Love,"Alright, so this is going to be hella messy. I'm sorry in advance.

  
I guess I should start from the beginning. I'm a 19 year-old female, who was abused (mostly mentally and emotionally) as a child. I currently still live at home. So you could definitely say I have daddy issues, as he was the one who abused the most (my mother also does but it's rarer). 

About 4 years ago, I started getting really attached to our family parish's priest. I knew that nothing would come of it, but there was still a feeling. And then when he left unexpectedly without saying goodbye, I really started to spiral. For 2 years before we finally saw him again, and I could kinda get closure. I would imagine what-if scenarios, but then eventually realized that I looked up to him as a father figure, a better one than my own father. 

Jump forward 4 years, and now I'm at a new job where I'm surrounded by older men (there are only two other women), which kinda makes me hella uncomfortable. It's kind of like a receptionist job, but it's also not. But I'm usually the only person in the whole building, which makes this situation even worse. Not to mention my dad also works here. 

When I started, there was this guy (we'll call A) who I shadowed. My dad warned me that he was a womanizer, and I figured that I wouldn't at all be his type (I'm not even close to the beauty standard, way curvier and have extra weight on me thanks to PCOS). I know I'm not, but the longer I work with him, the more...attraction (?) I feel toward him. He's also in his 40s, maybe even 50s.  And I know I'm not his type because he asked me about a woman who came in to apply and immediately asked me if she was hot. Like, I know what type of a guy he is. 

But these last couple of weeks, it's almost like he's trying to interact with me. For example, I received a phone call and then another as soon as I finished with the first one, but the second one seemed to have been a butt dial. I walk away to start doing something else, and then the phone rings again. This time, I'm a little annoyed and make my way back to the phone. And A then tells me that he's just screwing with me, and he's the one who is currently on the other line of the phone. I glare at him and laugh, and he smirks. 

And then today I asked him to do something, and he looks at me and says, ""Sure, I can do that,"" with a smirk on his face. And just this past week he's been talking to me more. And instead of eating in the break room like he normally does, he's been eating his lunch at his desk that is to the right of me (with plenty of space in between them because they are on opposite walls). But I swear he's watching me; I can feel his eyes on me.

Like I know nothing will come of this, and I also understand that this is from my ""daddy issues."" He's everything that I'm not. He's older, drinks a lot, and is a womanizer. And not to mention he's...well old. And he told another coworker that he's ""working on"" another girl from a business that we deal with where he's there for 2+ hours a day. 

How can I get over this? I thought I could, but it gets worse each day honestly. And being alone with him for a minimum of thirty minutes every day makes it even worse. Like, at this point I'm nervous around him, but yet I still want (?) him? But it's also like I want him to want me?

t3_1pk9unh,I have a crush on my coworker and I want to tell them.,"Hi reddit. Please take it easy on me this is my first time posting here. I have a crush on my coworker. Ive felt this way for over 2 years and i think im finally ready to say something even if nothing comes from it.

For starters I am a female in my 30s. My coworker is a male and hes a bit older than me. He's around his mid 40s. Lets call him Damien. Damien and I work for the same company but in different offices. I used to work in the same office as him about a year ago but I accepted a promotion in 2024 at a different office location. 

Damien is kind of a ""higher-up"" so on occasion he will come to my office for meetings with HR. Every time he comes to my office he'll say hi and make small talk. So i dont work with him directly but we still work for the same company and see each other from time to time. 

I liked him from the moment he started working with the company. We were in the same office before my promotion and we spent about a year working directly with each other. Our lunch room chats would go on for slightly too long which I always enjoyed. I wanted our conversations to last longer but he was always late for some kind of meeting. We share many common interests. We both especially enjoyed coffee and would make coffee for one another at the office. Even though we dont work directly with each other anymore we still see each other.

I saw him last week when he came to my office for a meeting and we spoke for a short while. I realized that I still feel the same way I did when I was working with him. All of a sudden I have this strong urge to get these feelings off my chest. Whether he feels the same or not, I just want to tell him. Not knowing whether he'd entertain getting to know me is what keeps my mind wandering. 

Here is my plan. I will be visiting his office in the next few weeks for a meeting. I wanted to give him a gift for Christmas. This is pretty normal in my company. Everyone is giving out gifts at this time. I planned to gift him some coffee beans from my favorite coffee shop. I wanted to include a small note with my number on it. Im not sure if this is a good idea. Im not exactly sure what to write in the note. When we worked together he told me that he was unmarried and not seeing anyone. Im not even sure if that is still the case so I really dont know if I should do it. Im concerned he wont take me seriously because of our age difference. I dont want to get reported to HR and have this blow up in my face. Worst case scenario he's not interested and that's totally okay with me. Im not expecting anything in return. I just cant keep living with my feelings. Reddit what should I do?

t3_1pimps5,Im a delusional High School Senior (17m) and I need help with my crush (17f),"Ok this is gonna sound really corny and is really long, but just hear me out. Made an alt acc just for this.

I am a HS senior, never had a gf (not even a first kiss). Before this year, I didn't really have a strong friend group (I have always had a lot of friends, but no close ones). In the past, I avoided talking to girls, and every time I had a discussion with a girl, it was really superficial and I could tell they weren't engaged.

In the past year, however, I became friends with this really cool group of people that I am so happy to have found. I have really been focusing on my looks as well (yes yes ik not all girls care about beauty and whatnot), and I just started shaving a week ago to trim off some of the extra facial hair i have. While I am pretty overweight, I've been losing weight with decent progress, so I got that going for me. I try to dress well too, and I have gotten compliments about my outfits improving this year. I have also gotten much more attention from women, to the point where I now have multiple friends who are girls. I think I've crushed most of my fear of women now.

...well except for her. Theres this girl that I have ONLY one class with, and she is drop dead gorgeous. Like the type you would daydream about alllllllllll day. She has brown eyes, is like 5'0 ish tall, and the must perfect curly hair ever. Lets call her ""Miley"". I had a history class with her 2 yrs ago in 10th grade, but i don't remember if she remembers me. At the time, I had a different crush (definitely not as deep as this one), but thats a whole different story.

The class Miley and I have together is on the last period of the day (important a bit later). One of my new friends in my friend group is in the class that Miley and I have together. He has a really big personality, and loves to banter with the teacher.

One time, he was talking to his friend who was sitting at the same table as Miley (behind my table), and I joined him. When they were talking, my friend ended with some corny line, and (exhibit a) Miley and I locked eyes, and started smiling/laughing at his stupidity. Now I might be overthinking this, but it was like a little bit too long to be a coincidence.

I dont remmeber if this was the same day or a different day, but when I was leaving class, I realized that we were going the same way, so I stopped, and introduced myself, but I, being a dumbas, offered a fcking handshake. This time, she just started giggling, smiled, and shook my hand. I was an absolute idiot, and I think i sold my chances in this moment

Later, my teacher paired us together for a project, so we worked on this. I kinda wanted to impress her, so I ""took charge"" by initiating a convo between the group, and I volunteered to do the harder section. Fast forward to the next day, when I was scrolling on instagram, I saw her dm me (exhibit b) asking for help on her part of the project. Now, heres the thing: The stuff she was asking questions abt was like one chatgpt answer away, and pretty self explanatory. Also, she reacted to the msgs with pink hearts with a bow on them, and idk if this is normal. Eventually, I dm her telling her about some bs thing in our project, just cuz I liked talking to her but I never rly got to do so.

Time passes by, I post a picture of autumn on my story, (exhibits c, d, e) she likes it. I post another thing on my story, she likes it. I post another a few weeks later, she likes it. In my head at this point, I thought she kinda liked me, so I started liking her stories back.

Then, my teacher in the class we have held me and my friend back after class to complain about his job (yeah this is a whole other story too). When the fiasco is over she was the first person I dmed, and we had a convo abt it. Ofc, I had to make things awkward again by thanking her for telling me to check my email for the class.

Today, I posted on my story again, and she saw it but didn't like it? (yeah wtf am I even saying I might just be reaching)

The only thing holding me back is one of my friends (not really a close friend but a good one) took her on a date last year, and she told him she wasn't ready for a relationship at the time. Idk if it was because of him, or if what she said was true, but if it is, I don't want to make her uncomfortable.

I have had a few crushes in HS. However, none of them have even gotten CLOSE to how I feel about this girl. I really really really really like her, but i dont know how to secure the bag. PLEASE help. she also might just think im weird.",Ok_Pin_9836,Alcohol/substances,High

Over six month relationship 
Medium distance (3hrs) 
Visits restricted to weekends 

I (F) have been dating my boyfriend (M) for about six months. We typically see each other from Friday night to Sunday afternoon, and up until now things felt like they were progressing normally. We’d lightly talked about long-term compatibility as we established we both are dating with intention. We also joked about marriage (him leading and much more with me playing along at times in some degrees), and discussed the idea of him eventually moving closer and us living together . Nothing official — just long-range “where could this go” type conversations.

Something happened last week that has completely shifted how I see him, and I’m struggling to tell if this is a huge incompatibility or a fixable communication issue.

The situation

I rent my home. I’m a single mom and I maintain everything myself — financially and physically. I take a lot of pride in my space, and I work hard to keep it clean, especially because I do everything alone. I have to work hard at this due to personal hindrances like adhd and some other spices mixed in there. I recently lost my job so things have been even tighter and I am just hyper aware of my resources and inability to replace anything, get anything new. 

My boyfriend has a dog. I’m not anti-dog, and I’ve already made multiple accommodations when they visit:
	•	I keep dog supplies at my house
	•	I’ve given him storage space
	•	I’ve tried to make sure visits are comfortable for both of them

Last week I simply said that I don’t want the dog in certain areas of my home because the extra fur and potential damage means hours of extra work for me. I didn’t say the dog wasn’t welcome. I just set a boundary about what spaces were okay.  This was a good amount of space and much more then what he leaves his dog kenneled in all day every day while he works. 

This was after he let his dog puke on my expensive rug and floors, used my hood bath towels to clean it up, dumped my clean cleaning rags on the floor, put dog puke covered towels in my washer, and then left some on my rug. I was already hyper sensitive about him hurting ny things because he also damaged a knife that was a gift from my parents using it as a can opener and damaged my vintage tv tray putting out his joint. 

His reaction

Instead of acknowledging the boundary, he took it extremely personally. He said it was “hurtful” that I didn’t want “any trace” of them in my home, and that asking for limits with the dog meant I didn’t want him or the dog around.

Then he escalated it into a whole conversation about whether he should “maintain his own home” if he ever moved closer — implying that my boundary somehow meant we had no future.

None of this was about what I actually said.

Other concerns that came up

He has severe allergies and I’ve made a big effort to accommodate them, but I’ve noticed:
	•	He gives contradictory information
	•	He refuses to carry an EpiPen even though he claims some allergies are severe and will cause death
	•	He expects me to follow strict food rules when cooking for him, but doesn’t follow those same rules for himself and even went out to eat with coworkers at places that had said deathly allergies at the table. 
	•	He’s avoided discussing these contradictions directly

This all makes it hard for me to plan anything safely — especially with my daughter in the home.

When I pointed out these inconsistencies, he shifted the conversation to how he felt “steamrolled” or “unheard,” rather than addressing the actual concerns.

How I feel

This situation left me:
	•	Feeling dismissed in my own home
	•	Feeling like my very reasonable boundary was twisted into something it wasn’t
	•	Concerned about how he handles conflict and accountability
	•	Worried that he jumps to victimhood instead of having adult conversations
	•	Unsure if he respects my role as a parent or the responsibilities I carry

I’ve taken space to think because I’m genuinely hurt. The whole thing made me reevaluate what’s actually best for me and my daughter. I’ve also decided I’m not discussing marriage or moving in together at all right now — those topics are off the table until I feel secure. If I ever do. He has stated he respects that however accountability is still lacking. All apologies have been in the classical I’m sorry you feel that way style. 

What are your thoughts? 

I’m not looking to punish him or play games — I just don’t want to ignore something that feels very important. I want to make the best decision for myself and my daughter.

Any insight is appreciated.

t3_1ph3gsk,Meth or cheating excuse?,"I was in a long-distance relationship for almost a year with a guy who, in the beginning, was extremely sweet, consistent, and responsible. He’s a single dad and when we met he had stable work, looked focused on building a future, and treated me very well. We video called constantly and he communicated with care. He’s been using meth for more than Y months in our relationship. we haven’t met yet and maybe that’s why I’m attached because we had “dreams” and “plans”.

Later on he started using meth again because he used to be an addict when he was young. At first he told me it was “free” and “not a big deal,” but people told me it’s never really free  you always pay in another way. Over time, his life became stressful: financial problems and losing access to things that normally helped him cope.

Everything changed after that. Which is so fast and random since there’s no fight just his temper. Here’s what happened:

* He became paranoid that someone is after him but he’d post normally on his social media. THIS IS OUT OF NOWHERE and he’d post normally. and I was scared because he convinced me it’s real and before that he and I were okay. 
* He ignored my calls or ended them after a few seconds
* He insulted me bad words
* Some days he’d say he loved me, other days zero effort
* He messaged my friends and his mom asking them to tell me to reply
* Had micro heating problems before many women on his social media caught him chatting to a few convinced myself that he’d stay with me cause he’d apologize after that

maybe the current problems caused him to have paranoia or psychosis? 

Eventually I confronted him about the things he said but he just keeps saying bad words. blocked him after that because I couldn’t take the emotional rollercoaster anymore. But I never got any closure or apology.

My question is:

Is this typical meth addiction behavior (paranoia, harsh words, pushing the partner away)? Or does this sound like cheating and him making up excuses to get rid of me?

t3_1pcoyrg,Is it a date/what is the vibe?,"So, I’m a bit confused so I’m seeking opinions on what this could be.

I work with a very attractive girl (both 28) and we’ve been getting on very well recently since getting to know each other better. We have a good laugh together and there’s some flirting between the two of us as we do spend a lot of time together in the office, but nothing too wild.

We were discussing a DJ that I saw last weekend. She was stunned, and said she wished she knew he was playing as she loves his music. She then said that he’s playing somewhere else in the city next Thursday 11th and that she wants to go to it, to which I said it sounds fun. She then said “Shall we go together?” and I agreed.

She proceeded to text me the link to the tickets, followed up that she’d bought hers and I confirmed I’d bought mine.

Later on the same day, we spent an hour just talking to each other and having a laugh together in the office amongst about 40-50 other people who were talking amongst themselves in the room after a celebration event in the office. Everyone gets on well here too, so it doesn’t seem like you’d do that together normally to me.

We then left the office for the day together, and walked until she went into the train station she was taking and I continued by myself until the one I was walking to. We then followed each other on Instagram.

The DJ event goes on until 2am is also straight after our work Christmas party, where we’ll be coming from and we will both have been drinking at prior to the event. With this in mind, I know myself, and it’s probably the same for most, that some things do tend to lead to another more if alcohol is involved.

Given all of this, is there a vibe that this is a date/intentions of interest in that?

I feel like you don’t just plan to go to an event until 2am with a guy from work if it’s not slightly the vibe in your head?

And even if that wasn’t her vibe, I feel like surely she must be aware in her head that just going with only me probably gives off a signal/vibe that there’s interest there so she would probably snuff that out in case it appeared that way and that wasn’t the vibe in case I thought that?

Anyway, I know from her Instagram that she has a lot of girl friends who are also into the same sort of music, so the fact she is just going with me seems like she probably wouldn’t need to just do that.

I know the “don’t shit where you eat” attitude and I get it. But, we’re both only contracted to work here until the end of March, and only go into the office once or twice a week. Also, two of the most senior staff members here met working here and are now married with children, so I don’t think it’s an office no go.

I definitely like her, so I’d be interested to know people’s thoughts and if they think there’s likely interest there, given the above, and what vibe she is likely thinking of me/the situation of us two going out after the Christmas party together.

t3_1pf5tkm,How do I show romantic interest without pressuring her or falling into “amixx mode”? Complicated situation (because I genuinely don’t know how to flirt) (M24 / F19),"Hi. I really need some help with this because I’m messing things up in my head.

I’m a 24-year-old guy, she’s 19. We study at the same university and share several classes.

From the very beginning she showed interest: compliments, suggesting we watch a show together over a call, things like that. But back then I didn’t respond much because I wasn’t sure and I wasn’t really attracted yet.

Then another guy started showing interest in her. When I noticed she was also getting to know him, I got jealous and suddenly realized I was attracted to her. So I started showing more interest: saying good morning every day, sending slightly romantic messages (emojis, light hints), and I asked her out.

We’ve been talking for like two months already, and gone out twice so far. •	The first time (a bar), I didn’t feel she was very into it. •	The second time felt more intimate: we sat close, I put my arm around her, we walked holding hands, and I tried to kiss her. I told her I’d like to kiss her and she just said she’s shy. She didn’t reject me directly, but she also didn’t move forward.

We’ve kept chatting, but I don’t feel the same “momentum” I saw at the beginning, when she was the one making plans and showing a lot of interest. Now I’m the one taking initiative, and even though she doesn’t say no, her level of interest feels lower than before. Something that worry me is that I don’t feel like “knowing each other energy”. I mean, we're not asking each other about the kind of things you talk when you’re knowing each other, like dreams, fears and all that. For some reason I haven’t asked that things because I feel like my normal conversation is about school and that kind of stuff, and I don’t know how to get to that kind of topics without feeling like I’m changing the vibe drastically.

There was also an awkward moment: a guy selling roses came up to us, assumed we were a couple, and offered me one. I got nervous and ended up buying it for her. It felt weird, and I’m afraid she may have interpreted it as unnecessary pressure. Since that day, I’ve lowered the intensity of my messages so I don’t overwhelm her. But now I’m afraid she thinks I “switched to friends-only mode” or lost interest.

Another important thing: I’m shy and I genuinely don’t know how to flirt. In person, approaching her is extremely hard for me. Sometimes I literally struggle just to greet her; I get scared and awkward. At school I sometimes can’t mentally connect that she’s the same person I talk to every day through chat, so in real life she suddenly feels almost like a stranger, which freezes me even more.

When this whole thing started, she was actually the one approaching me in person to chat. Now most of our interactions happen through messages — and usually she’s the one who initiates the chat.

Most of our connection happens online. And in about a week and a half she’s going back to her hometown; I won’t see her for two months. That gives me a mix of anxiety, pressure and fear, cause I think we can lose our connection because this lack of interaction in dates, and 2 months is a long time I guess. I don’t want to pressure her — or myself — but I’m sure I do want something romantic with her.

I don’t think it’s the right moment to have a serious conversation about “what we are” because we’ve only been on two dates and I feel we still don’t have the emotional intimacy for that.

Two more details that might be relevant: •	She tends to avoid eye contact a bit. •	On our second date she didn’t initiate physical contact, but when I did, she accepted it.

Something that matters for context: in Spanish, “amixx” is a playful, exaggerated way of saying “friend” — often used jokingly or as a soft, gender-neutral meme-like version of “amigo/amiga.” This was our way to call each other since the beginning of our interactions, but I personally started avoid using it because it sounds too platonic, but she sometimes still uses it with me. I’m not sure if she means it seriously or just as a lighthearted expression.

So here are my questions: •	When and how should I show romantic signals again without sounding pressuring? •	What kind of messages keep the romantic vibe alive without being invasive? Concrete examples would help. •	Should I try to see her again before she leaves, or give space so she can miss me? •	What kind of activities are good for connecting if I get distracted easily when there’s something other than talking? •	How do I avoid looking desperate or falling into this “amixx mode”? •	Could the rose incident have felt like pressure? If so, how do I fix that? •	What message frequency is healthy in a situation like this — daily, every couple of days, or just letting it flow?

I’d really appreciate practical advice, especially from people who’ve been in similar situations: strong initial connection, recent dates, lots of texting, fear of pressuring, and a long upcoming separation.

t3_1pgj0ls,We both were best friends but I caught feelings… I failed to save our friendship,"I should ask right? But maybe I’m not ready to listen to his answer - I know what it is. He would say ‘I don’t feel the same’.

We have been friends for last 2 years and our dynamic was crazy good. We would talk everyday, he would be there for me everyday, would listen to everything I have to say or listen to my long voice notes. He would never complain. I would send him tons of texts and he would reply to all of them one by one with the same energy. I mentioned once I wanna go to Italy it’s my dream and he said I want to make it come true. We both planned a trip to Italy and went there alone. 
So we both don’t live in the same country but he travels to mine every year because his family is here. For the first time, I crossed countries to travel alone with a guy best friend and yes I trust him a lot. 

The trip was good, we both saw new sides of each other. Yes we shared a room for 10 days and often a bed too but nothing happened between us, he didn’t even touch me. He took care of me and was very protective of me throughout. He observed my sleeping patterns and watched my dietary habits. We fought once too but I sorted it out next morning and we got back to normal. When the trip ended, I felt heaviness. Nobody ever took care of me like this, I have always been the one who took of others and myself, I was so used to doing things alone that when someone else was doing it for me - I felt soft and I was comfortable being me and in my female energy. 

I came back to my country with tons of memories, a suitcase filled with dirty laundry and a heaviness, mixed emotions with thoughts. Thoughts about him. His absence hit me. What if we could be more? I wanted more with him. I wanted him.

He became distant - I felt avoided and ignored. The guy who used to talk to me everyday and reply to all my texts with the same energy was now replying 2-3 times a week and with no energy. I felt a shift and it made me worse. My feelings grew and I got attached but never confessed. I asked him so many times what’s wrong? He said I’m just busy with life.
Funny how the most consistent guy who when through hell and back in last 2 years never got busy for me before but now he is, it didn’t settle with me. I kept trying to save our friendship and suppress my feelings thinking it will go away before I see him again. It didn’t go away. 
One day I told him I injured my wrist at gym and another guy helped me late at night, post that event he became normal with me again. It just happened suddenly. I wasn’t even expecting him to do that lol.

After 4 months he is in my country again for Christmas. I met him yesterday. He was very comfortable with me being himself. Earlier he was often quiet, would not maintain eye contact and I was talkative with him but now he would look straight at me, would keep talking while I won’t. He noticed my new hair color, he asked when did you get it done?? He said YU got your eyebrows???
I said yes I always do why what’s wrong?
He said I observed it today, now I need to do that girls don’t feel I don’t observe them.

He asked about my dating life, if I’m seeing someone?, if I’m planning to get married soon?, what’s your criteria while finding a guy? Let me do some counselling here.
I said I don’t have anyone.
Then he said he’s talking to a girl who lives in another city and he will be flying to meet her specifically. 
Something broke in me.
I smiled and said that’s good.
He used to say he is emotionally unavailable, yesterday do the first time he said I want a girlfriend now, the pool doesn’t have many options left and I want to settle down now. You do need someone in life.

I kept eating. 
I felt his eyes on me I didn’t look up. He would always get a beer or a light alcohol with me, yesterday for the first time he took LIIT.

We joked around a bit more before he dropped me home. 

Before going I made a mental note that after this meeting, I will never speak with him or meet him ever again. I want to close the chapter for my own good and sanity. I was getting anxious with the new him because I couldn’t get over the old him and the friendship we had.
I tried to save the friendship but I failed. I tried to suppress my feelings but I am getting worse.
A part of me feels he knows, another part of me feels he is just busy in his life and the priorities for him have changed.

If I confess, I might not be able to handle the truth. If I don’t? I suffer longer. 
Either way I lose him or I have already lost him.

Sorry this was too long, thank you for your patience reading this.

t3_1p98w75,Had a great phone call and date set but it’s 10 days away. Should I text her in the meantime or leave it alone?,"I (37 M) matched with someone on Hinge (35 F). We’ve been messaging for about a week, and last night we had our first phone call and it went really well. The conversation flowed naturally, no awkward silences, and time just flew by. We both asked each other questions, had similar energy, and she was warm, funny, and engaging. At the end of the call, we set up a date for December 8th.

Here’s my dilemma: that’s still about a week and a half away. She said she’d text me if her schedule changes and we can meet earlier, but realistically it looks like Dec 8 will be the day. I just don’t want the momentum to fizzle out. At the same time, I don’t want to come across as clingy or over-texting. I gave her my number, but she hasn’t texted me, which is fine she’s been responsive on the app and everything has been positive.

So what’s the move here? Should I send a light check-in text/message sometime this week? Should I not text at all until the day before to confirm the date? Is silence for 10 days normal after already having a great phone call and setting up a date? How do you keep things warm but not smothering during that in-between time?

Would love to hear what usually works best, especially from people with more dating experience. Thanks!",DarkOfTheSun,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1p761h1,Do I have no self respect if I ask this man out,"I am an exchange student and I went out to dinner with some friends and something in my gut told me to go talk to this guy so we had a brief interaction. A few days later we all went out and me and this guy danced together, talked all night and was flirty with me. We sat outside a pho restaurant til 4am with a few friends where he put his hand on my back, our knees were touching and he was singing and playing the guitar. But I accidentally sent him a signal that I was not interested (I looked under the table to see if our knees were touching because I thought it was cute) and he stopped all flirting from there and moved his chair away. He was always very gentlemanly, he held the doors open, pulled out my chair etc and would ask me questions. During this night, he did however ask me how my family would feel about me dating outside of my race, which I think is a little fast 



I dmd him just to talk and we had two chill and normal conversations (on seperate occasions) (where he told me his fav cafe that he gate kept from everyone else and spots to take my family to who were visiting soon), I then asked him to come hang out with the friend group and he said yes then cancelled at the time of the event starting with no reason (he did apologise but still) 



From there we ran into each other at university and had a few of really nice conversations, there was a cultural day and I went and he was running his countries booth and he was in his cultural clothing and invited me (and only me) to try it on, he tied it up for me and we chatted and played some games together. I had to leave and I said my goodbyes and he asked me to come back to keep playing the games if I was still going to be around. Many hours later I came back and we played the games (with our other friends) and there wasn't much conversation as he was facilitating the game. He has stated to me before that he would never assume a girl likes him, even if she makes all the signals and if everyone else states she does unless she tells him directly.

  
Every time I see him on campus he intitiates conversation and seems excited to see me, he studies tech and is sporty and loves music. Sometimes he gets nervous to talk to me, previously at a dinner with many friend groups he would like try to find opportunities to get to talk to me and I could feel him looking over at me, this used to happen every time but now he is way more confident in talking with me.

  
I want to go out with him, because I find him really cute but I dont think hes gonna do anything or make any moves. I feel like im gonna have to ask him out because he makes 0 romantic moves on me but I also am scared too and feel like I have no self respect if I do considering how last time was. But also why not just go for it life is short

t3_1p71c9p,The guy im talking to likes me too much,"I've been talking to this guy for a few weeks sort of on and off nothing serious just like randomly text sometimes. He asked me on a date then cancled twice which he now says is because he was nervous since we met on tinder which I ussually use as a joke but we kind of got along so ig that is reasonable. But when we finally actually went on a date we clicked really well and got along and it was a good time. But now he keeps sending me like insta reels about cuddling and stuff and like relationship type stuff, when we only went on one date, and texting me about how much fun he had on the date for like the past 2 days and how much he wants to see me. And he look like a bunch of like pictures and videos while we were hanging out which kind of wierded me out and now he keeps like sending them to me. Idk it's really weirding me out but I don't know if I should be wierded out. My ex was really toxic so I'm not super used to like the outward affection but it just feels like a lot and is kind of icking me out. Also he's 20, im 18, and he's a Virgin.. he's not waiting for marriage and it isn't for religious reasons, he's kissed like a normal amount of people but has only been in one relationship and it was only 3 months. Both of those just seem kind of odd to me like how do you make it to 20 with only 1 relationship when he's clearly looking for one. I just need someone to tell me if it's just my own like attraction to toxic habits because of my past that is making him being nice sound wierd. Or if this is actually odd and he's really just a wierd guys. I've only been in one relationship but it was for 2 years and we were friends for years before so I don't have any familiarity on how relationships ussually start, if it's normally like this, I've heard guys fall for girls a lot faster maybe that's it.

t3_1p3ha2t,My situationship is sleeping with other people,"i (18) female have been in a long distance relationship on and off for the past 4 years with someone we’ll call sophia (19) female. 

we’ve dated since we were 14 years old and i’ve met her in person before. we’ve both had mental health problems so we broke up because our relationship turned toxic. we’ve been on and off no contact since. we’ve been talking again since halloween. she’s expressed to me that she wants to be with me but online dating won’t work right now. i agree with this statement. we decided to date again once we start college so we can move in together and our relationship will work. 

the problem with this is sophia says one thing but does another. she says she’ll continue to see other people and doesn’t mind if i do as well. (i have not seen other people) i’ve expressed that if she wants to sleep with other people that’s fine but i don’t want to hear about it. it makes me uncomfortable and sad. i brought up that i was friends with someone again that she doesn’t like. (at the time i had no idea she did not like them) she then proceeded to say that she’s on facetime with one of the people she’s sleeping with out of malice after i specifically asked multiple times for her to not talk about the people she’s sleeping sleeps with.

she continues to make promises that our relationship will work once the distance isn’t a thing anymore but i have a fear that she’s leading me on. i’ve talked to her about this already and she told me im her number one priority. she talks about out future house and pets and the life we’re gonna build but then sleeps with others. i know she’s a “sex addict” and i understand the distance is hard and wanting physical affection is totally normal and we’re not dating atm but i’m just not sure anymore. i want to be with her she’s all i want but i’m scared. it just doesn’t make sense to me how she can be physically intimate with others while telling me i’m all she wants . i’m sure what advice i’m looking for but opinions and comments are encouraged.",ihatebroccoli29,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1p5728m,Developing feelings for a guy abroad… Am I wasting my time??,"I (23F) met a guy (26M) while backpacking about 6 months ago. We clicked instantly — same humor, really strong chemistry. We ended up hooking up once, but honestly the connection felt more emotional than physical for me.

After the trip, we texted casually for a bit, but his communication was inconsistent and I didn’t feel emotionally safe, so I told him I couldn’t keep talking if it wasn’t going anywhere. He didn’t fight it, and we stopped talking for months.

Fast forward to last week: I reached out responding to his story and somehow it opened the door to really vulnerable conversations. He told me a bunch of things he has held back from saying and how he wishes there were more of me's in the world, and how he was really bummed how it all ended and he wished he put in more effort.

We have been talking consistently now for a bit over text, sending voice memos, and he has opened up a lot about things on his end. He will throw out visiting each other in a fantasy sense and what it would be like, he sends a lot of photos of his day, and mentions me to his friends.

He is a lot of things I would want in a connection, super smart, kind, funny, and we have the same interests.

So part of me feels like this could be something real.

BUT… the inconsistency is still there. And it also does not help that we are continents apart.

He’ll be super warm and engaged one day (lots of texting, voice notes, vulnerable stuff), and then go almost silent the next day except for a random picture. He tends to only text at certain times of the day and is super specific and intentional about when he talks to me. He rarely dates and I can tell he is not very experienced relationally and told me he wanted me to be honest and help him do better if he wasn't acting great.

I finally told him that emotional intensity followed by silence feels like whiplash for me, and that I need some consistency to stay open. He responded kindly and said he struggles with texting during the day but that everything he said still stands, that he really likes me and wants to get to know me, and his mind is focused on his favorite girl. Since then he’s been a little better, and it seems something could be growing here.

Here’s the problem:

I get REALLY anxious when he pulls back. I overthink everything, especially because our old dynamic he was very surface level and was a bit breadcrummy. I don’t want to become attached to someone who lives across the world and might not follow through.

My mom pointed out that I’m building something with a person I can’t even see, and that long distance with someone I barely know makes little logical sense. She thinks I’m setting myself up to get hurt, and honestly… she might be right.

At the same time, I haven’t felt this kind of connection in a long time, and I don’t want to shut it down prematurely. I do want to date intentionally and give people a chance.

So I’m stuck between:

•    investing in something that feels meaningful but uncertain

vs

•    protecting myself from getting attached to someone who may not show up

I guess my questions are:

1.    Is this worth exploring, or am I clinging to a fantasy?

2.    Is his behavior normal or a red flag?

3.    Should I step back, or give it time to unfold?

4.    How do you tell the difference between potential and breadcrumbing?

I really don’t want to waste my time, but I also don’t want to run away the second a connection requires patience.

t3_1oyuhx7,"Am I expecting too much three months in, or is he just not emotionally available?","Hi guys. I’m a 26F dating a 32M, and I really need perspective on whether I’m expecting too much or if this situation just isn’t right for me.

When we first met, everything was great. Honestly, I wasn’t super interested at first — he wasn’t really my “type” — but I did find him attractive and decided to give it a chance. And in the beginning, he showed up for me in ways I’ve never experienced.

He was extremely consistent, texted me regularly, planned our first date, opened every door, never sexualized me, kissed me on the cheek, and was just a real gentleman. He would even send me gas money because I live far away from him. He treated me better than any man I’ve dated before, and I think that’s why I sometimes feel guilty for wanting more — because I’m not used to being treated that well.

But as time went on, he fell off.

He’s been going through a rough time mentally, which I understand. He’s new to the city, he doesn’t have family here, he doesn’t really have many friends here, and I know that can be extremely isolating. Part of me genuinely feels for him because I know that must be hard. I’ve been trying to be understanding of his situation and his mental health.

But even with all that, it doesn’t change how his actions affect me.

He would go three weeks without seeing me, barely text, never call, and make zero plans. I was always the one calling or asking if I could call him. The only reason I saw him after those three weeks was because I asked.

During that same three-week stretch, he also randomly texted me saying he wanted to quit his job, move back home, and that “his heart isn’t here.” That really hurt me, because it felt like he could leave at any moment.

I’ve tried to be supportive. He opened up to me once and I told him I’m here for him and I care about what he’s going through. But I also don’t want to ignore my own needs. Dating is about making time, communication, and compromise — and he hasn’t been doing any of that.

After we finally saw each other, I told him how that “I want to move back home” message hurt me, and I asked where he even sees this going if he’s not sure he’s staying in the state. I told him the next three weeks cannot be like the last. He agreed and said things would change.

They didn’t.

Another three (almost four) weeks passed with the same inconsistency. And again, the only reason I ended up seeing him was because one night he was horny, our conversation turned sexual, and suddenly he wanted me to come over at 10 PM. I couldn’t, so he asked me to come later that week.

When I went to his place, he was super affectionate that night — and then in the morning he was distant again. It hurt because he won’t plan a date or make time for me, but he’s very eager to see me when he’s horny.

This week was especially tough for me. I’m moving back home due to financial issues and debt. I’ve been stressed, barely eating, can’t keep food down, can’t sleep. I told him all of this. I told him I was struggling. I asked if I could come see him for just 2–3 hours on Saturday.

He told me he couldn’t because there were UFC fights he wanted to watch.

At that point I just sat there like… wow.

So now I’m asking: Am I expecting too much, or am I just finally realizing that what he’s doing is the bare minimum?

Sometimes I feel like maybe I’m being too emotional because I’m going through a rough time myself. I try not to make everything about me. I know he’s struggling too, he’s alone in a new city, and that can take a toll. But at the same time, if you work a normal job, don’t make plans, don’t call, don’t text, barely see the person you’re dating, and use your weekends to be alone…

Maybe you’re just not in the right place to date.

t3_1oy58mo,Is it normal to feel this upset about how my first time happened?,"I don’t really know who to talk to about this, so I’m posting here.

My boyfriend (28M) is genuinely a good, caring person overall. He treats me well, is sweet to me, and I don’t think he’s a bad guy or that he meant to hurt me. I want to say that upfront because i don’t think he’s a bad person or bad partner.



But I’m having a really hard time processing how my first time went, and I keep getting more upset the more I think about it, even though it was 3-4 months ago.



For context:

He’s my first boyfriend and my first sexual partner.  We had been together around 8 months before having sex. I know that’s longer than usual, and I honestly felt bad making him wait, but I just wasn’t comfortable or ready yet. He knew I was nervous, and he knew it would be my first time.

Before it happened, we had fooled around in bed several times. A couple of those times he asked if I wanted to have sex, and I said no or hesitated, and he stopped. I really appreciated that. So for me, “asking first” felt like something I could rely on.

When it finally happened, we were fooling around again like we had before. I was comfortable with what we were doing up to that point. But he didn’t ask this time—he just…put it in. It was brief and honestly more like a “it slipped in” moment. He didn’t check in during or after. No “is this okay?” or “are you comfortable?” “Was that okay?” or anything like that. It was just over, and nothing was said.

tldr; Is it normal to feel this upset about how my first time happened? I had wanted it to be special, but I’m left feeling uncared for.   


I didn’t say anything either, I think because I felt a little in shock in the moment. I do feel embarrassed about how inexperienced I‘m, and I didn’t know how to bring it up. almost immediately after our lives then got really busy and we just moved on like nothing had happened.

I know I shouldn’t have been in that situation if I wasn’t 100% comfortable with sex happening. I get that. I’m not trying to blame him for everything. But I was expecting him to ask like he had before, especially because I had been nervous and had said no in the past. I don’t really feel like that moment was my choice. I really would like to be able to look back and say “yes, that was my decision,” but I don’t feel that way. It feels like it was taken out of my hands. 

We have had sex since then, and things now are better. Some experiences have been good. But the beginning still sits heavily with me and not something I look back on as a good memory. I feel disappointed, uncared for, and honestly just kinda sad that my first time went like that. tbh I cry or almost cry whenever I think about it, even months later.

I don’t think he meant harm. I don’t think he’s a monster. it had been a while since he had had sex and he was kinda nervous. I think he probably thought I was into it because we were already fooling around, but he also knew I was nervous and that I had said no befor. If it were me and my partners first time, idk I would have checked in at least once.

I’ve never talked to him about it becaue like I said, i felt a little uncomfortable bringing it up at the time and I was trying to sort out how I felt about it and then life just go busy and I also do still struggle with feeling shame about being so inexperienced at my age. I don’t like bringing attention to that fact. 

it has been months now since this happened and I can’t seem to move past it on my own, I feel maybe I should talk with him about it. I do think if he knew how I felt he’d be apologetic….but another part of me feels like what’s the point in bring it up now, if he had wanted to check in or make sure my first time felt okay he would have asked back then (maybe he was embarrassed or insecure to? But still…) and I guess it’s just me expressing how I need check-ins going forward if he were to try anything new, but it still won’t erase how sad I feel about that first time.

Any perspective or advice would be appreciated. How should I bring this up months later? Is it even worth staying in this relationship? I’m starting to just feel kinda resentful towards him about it as well whcih I know isn’t healthy.

t3_1oxk1lk,"Is this a situationship, and how do I proceed?","Thank you in advance to anyone who reads through this; it's a long read, but I just want to give as much context as possible.

I was dating a guy for about 10 months (both our first time dating), and I ended it with him because I thought I wasn't giving him enough attention and decided that he deserved someone who could fully appreciate him. Throughout our relationship, I was cagey and having a rough time with my own friendships, so I didn't tell like telling anyone about us. My family knew that he and I were close friends, but I never mentioned that he was my boyfriend. To this day, they still have no idea. I think this really hurt his feelings, and on top of that, I didn't put in the effort to meet his friends, which I know was awful of me because he really wanted me to be integrated into his life. The reason for my discomfort was that I was uncomfortable with the concept of dating because I never imagined myself in a relationship before him, so I was wondering if I was somewhere on the ace spectrum. All these issues were stacking up, and I decided that he shouldn't be taking on the burden of my issues; thus, I decided to end things. We decided that we would still be friends because there was no reason to hate each other. After all, we still enjoyed each other's company, and we could still hang out. It was going well until I told him that I still had feelings for him around 2 months after we broke up, but we were in school at the time and he was preparing for a professional exam, so I didn't want to distract him and said that we could talk about what we are and where we stand after he finished. He agreed to talk about it later and also said that he still had feelings for me.

Fast forward to now, around 3 months after this conversation, and I brought up the topic again. In these few months, we were texting almost daily and hung out fairly regularly. During our conversations and hangouts, we still used cutesy language and touched each other's hair and stuff -- things neither of us would do with other friends. I asked him if he was still interested in me and if he wanted to try again, but he said that while he still cared about me, it would be best if we just stayed friends. He said that he liked the dynamic we had now, but I can't help thinking that this dynamic is not a normal friend dynamic. I told him that I'm scared that one day, he'll find someone else and leave me behind. I even told him that I get jealous when he goes clubbing because he might find someone else, and he assured me that he wouldn't find anyone at a club or at work. I told him that it was really hard to find someone that I was so comfortable around, and that I could imagine a future with him. I told him that we could let it go if he no longer had feelings for me, and he said that sometimes he still thought about me when we were in a relationship. However, he did not want to try again, which would have been fine with me, except that on the way back to the train station, we linked arms the whole way and we leaned on each other the whole ride back. I was so confused, because he was saying one thing, but his actions tell another story. It's been a few days since this talk, and we still text every day in the same manner.

There is more context, but honestly this is already pretty long and I think the gist is there. So now begs the question, is this a situationship? And how should I deal with it? Should I bring this topic up again in the future or let it go and just let it be? Any other advice would be appreciated too. Thanks again.",Impressive-Pie5895,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1ox75ky,AI broke down all her manipulative moves in real time… and the date escalated fast,"So I had a date last night that went from “eh, this won’t go anywhere” to *“holy sh*t, how did this even happen?”\*  
And honestly… I can’t take all the credit.

For context: I’ve been testing this app called [WingDate](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6754293123) — it listens to your conversation (with consent, chill) and gives you tiny real-time hints in your ear. Not pickup lines — more like *emotional radar*.

I didn’t think it would actually matter.  
Until last night.

# We meet at the bar.

She’s cute, confident, a bit too sharp for a first date.  
Within ten minutes, I feel the familiar “I’m losing control of the frame” vibe.

Suddenly my AirPod buzzes:

&gt;“She’s testing boundaries — stay calm, don’t overexplain.”

And damn… she *was*.

She hit me with the classic:  
**“Why are you even single?”**  
Normally I’d start blabbering some self-justification.  
This time I just smiled:  
**“Because I don’t settle quickly.”**

Her face did a tiny, surprised micro-freeze.

The app whispers again:

&gt;“She’s trying to see if you’ll chase. Don’t.”

So I didn’t.

# Then came the ‘push-pull’ phase.

She’d lean in → then emotionally pull back.  
Ask a deep question → then act bored.  
Classic mixed-signal tactics.

WingDate basically narrated the psychology of every move:

&gt;“Neg-hit incoming… don’t respond emotionally.”  
“She’s probing insecurity… redirect with curiosity.”  
“She expects you to justify — reverse the frame.”

I swear, it felt like someone handed me the *boss fight guidebook* mid-game.

And the craziest part?  
The dynamic flipped. **Fast.**

She started playing with her hair, laughing more, touching my arm, all the obvious stuff.

# The moment everything turned

She tried one last “control test”:

Her:  
**“You seem very… composed. Hard to read.”**

WingDate:

&gt;“She wants you to admit uncertainty. Don’t.”

So I said:  
**“I’m just patient. I like to see who a person really is.”**

She looked at me like I just unlocked a cheat code.

Ten minutes later she’s suggesting we “go somewhere quieter.”

# Long story short… the date escalated. Fast.

Way faster than I expected.  
Way smoother than I’ve ever managed solo.

And the wild thing is — I didn’t feel fake.  
I just felt… aware. Like someone finally turned subtitles on for human behavior.

If anyone’s curious, the app is **WingDate** — the whole point is decoding emotional signals/manipulations in real time and whispering tiny nudges into your ear.  
I honestly thought it was a gimmick.

After last night?  
Yeah… no.  
It’s staying installed.",KnowledgeVisual1866,General consent ambiguity,Medium
t3_1owta0d,My (29F) gf (32F) has been talking to an ex and flirting possibly with a friend and I’m not sure I’m handling it best.,"I have anxiety in general and probably some anxious-attachment tendencies, so I’m trying to understand my reactions instead of assuming the worst. I just need advice on how to communicate in a healthy way because every time I bring something up, it becomes an argument.

My girlfriend (32F) and I (29F) were friends for about two months before we started hooking up. During that time she told me a lot about her past, including one ex who really hurt her and who she called “the one that got away.” They dated about five years ago and we’ve been together for about a year.

About four months ago, she handed me her phone to check a message from a mutual friend. I noticed her ex had hidden alerts turned on, and when I tapped the conversation I saw my girlfriend had texted her “hi.” I asked why her alerts were hidden and why she sent that message. It turned into an argument — she said lots of people’s messages are set that way, that it was harmless, and that it wasn’t really my business. Afterward, she changed her password.

Two weeks ago she mentioned this ex casually while telling me a story, and when I asked if they’d talked recently she said she hadn’t heard from her in months. The next day she asked me to take a picture of her in some pants for her mom, and her ex sent her a Snapchat. When I pointed it out, she said Snapchat “isn’t a form of communication” and doesn’t count as hearing from someone.

There’s also a friend of hers who feels a little too close. My girlfriend showed me a meme where this friend texted her “me when we don’t fuck,” and my girlfriend replied “you’re insane I love that.” I reacted, and she told me she doesn’t cheat and it was just a joke.

When I bring up anything that makes me uncomfortable, she says I’m overthinking or that she “doesn’t even have time to cheat.” She also said this ex has been a recurring issue in all her relationships and that stopping contact isn’t something she’s willing to do.

This is my first WLW relationship and I don’t know what’s normal. I love her and I think she loves me, but I’m losing sleep and I don’t know how to talk about this without it turning into another fight.

TL;DR:
My girlfriend hides notifications from her ex, messages her on and off (including Snapchat), has a very flirty friend, and gets defensive or says I’m overthinking whenever I try to talk about how it makes me feel. I need advice on how to communicate about this in a calm, productive way.",Aggressive_Kale3349,Mixed signals,High
t3_1owqj52,My (20F) girlfriend wants me (20NB) to move country for her,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for over a year now and we have been long distance since the beginning of the relationship. She lives in Switzerland whilst I live in the UK so we would have to fly over to see each other. 

During the time we started dating I was studying in uni full-time whilst she was helping out at her family’s restaurant and began studying once a week at an academy. She had more free time and money to afford to see me so naturally she came a lot to visit almost every month and when I had holidays (they were a month or two long) I would spend my time in Switzerland. 

Earlier this year I dropped out of uni as I was really overwhelmed and unhappy with the place I was studying at which took a massive toll on my mental health to the point where I had to get extra support from a mental health hospital. It then led me to taking meds and I immediately booked a flight to stay with my girlfriend for a month. I was numb for a long period of time emotionally which was quite challenging on our relationship as I don’t necessarily remember very well what happened but I was either not very responsive at all or extremely agitated at times. Because of that we had a lot of arguments and I think that really changed our relationship. I’m not sure whether it was for best or worst but a little while after that she became really bad mentally and was depressed for a period of time but was refusing help. 

She then visited the uk again before we planned to meet in asia for our two month holiday and before she left she explained how she felt she’s been spending so much money seeing me and been putting more effort financially and time wise to make this work but I was explaining how I haven’t been financially amazing at that point and have been trying to save up more so eventually we could live together or I could come see her more. 

Whilst on holiday we went through a lot of talks and arguments to the point where I packed up my stuff and tried to walk out on her as she wasn’t understanding my feelings at the time and no matter how much I begged her to understand me she kept saying she wanted to break up so it led me to walking out. She then broke down on the floor explaining everything she was going through when she realised I was being serious. She explained the issue with her dad trying to be controlling over her life and it was harder for her to lie to him every time she came over to the uk to see me (he doesn’t know we’re together). Even though her parents are divorced and she lives with her mum, she still has to see him often as she works at his restaurant. And she didn’t want to admit that she was depressed for so long and knew that she was letting out a lot of her issues on me without actually targeting the problem. After a really long talk we decided to work things out and agreed to communicate with each other (this was in August). 

We were good for a while but the issue with her is that every time we have arguments she tends to bring up the past and it’s so exhausting sometimes to talk to her or figure things out that I tend to just cry and beg her to not leave me. 

Recently she came over again to celebrate her birthday and that was the most solid we have been in a while and I felt like we openly spoke about what we wanted for the future and our past traumas from relationships and childhood. We spent a month together in the UK and seeing her so happy by being able to see her inner child when we went to events was so magical. We have a shared love for anime and music so being able to bring her to a convention I’ve never seen her so happy before. Also when we went to watch the chainsaw movie the whole day she was bubbly it was so cute. I put in so much effort for her birthday and it was so worth it because we both had a blast. Saying goodbye to each other was so hard but there was no tears this time just happiness. 

It has been a week now since she left and she’s been really ill in bed to the point where she is weak and can’t take care of herself. Today she crashed out really bad and said that she “couldn’t do this anymore” she wished that we were able to be together to take care of each other not having to plan out every time when is the next time to see each other. Although she loves me very much it is so draining and hard for her to be able to keep doing this and now that her dad has been extra pushy with her spare time she isn’t able to visit as much. Ideally she would want to study here and be able to live with me but it isn’t possible as her dad has cancer at the moment and wants her to take over the restaurant which is something she wants to do. 

So now we have reached the issue where she’s given me an ultimatum, either we live together or focus on our own paths. I am so scared because as much as I actually don’t like living here in the UK for my own issues it would mean starting over a new life if I was to move to Switzerland. I work as a DJ on the weekends and recently have been getting booked so much for these gigs that target an East Asian audience here which I’ve been really enjoying but also worn out from. I know I’m young and I should enjoy my life especially now that I’m going out a lot because of this job I’ve been able to meet a lot of friends through this but I am so worn out from the party lifestyle and I really want to be able to have a sustainable job during the day and not have a messed up sleep schedule. I’ve been applying for jobs in the UK for two years but haven’t been successful with finding one as most of my life has been dedicated to studying in music. 

Essentially I guess a part of me is really scared because I don’t know where in the city my girlfriend is staying would take me in for work as I only speak English and I have not a lot of work experience besides from teaching music production, being a sound engineer and DJ. I would really want to move in with her and find a normal job but I guess I’m also burnt out mentally from all these gigs so I haven’t really been able to do a lot of research or action to figure out a plan where I would feel secure. 

TL;DR:

I’m in a long-distance relationship with my Swiss girlfriend of over a year. We’ve both struggled with mental health, family pressure, and the imbalance of travel and money. After a lot of stress on both sides, she told me she can’t keep doing long distance and wants us to live together, especially with her dad’s health issues and responsibilities at the family restaurant. I want to be with her but I’m scared because moving to Switzerland means starting over with no stable job, limited work experience outside of music, and no guarantee I’ll find work as an English speaker. I’m mentally exhausted and unsure what to do.",Time_Huckleberry792,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1ov4syb,26F had my first one night stand and feel like a loser,"Last week I was on vacation and I had my first (probably/most definitely last) one night stand ever. I matched with him 28M on hinge and went into the date thinking: if it's going to happen i'll let it happen because I was really attracted to him and kind of curious about what a one night stand would feel like. I've only ever had sex in relationships and a low body count so it's really out of my comfort zone. We went to a bar, had a couple drinks and then went to his place. I don't regret going with him. It was fun and he was nice. We also had fun conversations and he told me I can stay over and the next morning we could grab something to eat. But I didn't want to stay because I had plans the next morning and I felt like I may get attached if I spent to much time with him. Nonetheless, the next two days we were texting a bit. Our bit was that we were lovebombing each other and we kept doing it over text. He also liked my insta stories. And on my last night on vacay I texted him, he asked me if I want to come over but in the end nothing happened because neither of us wanted to pay for the uber. Now I feel like a loser because I wanted to experience a one night stand but I have the urge to reach out and talk to him. I don't understand how people can just do it and then not care at all. Is it normal after a one night stand to want to keep talking to the other person? I even thought of texting him again but I don't think there's any point in doing so since we live in different countries and I barely know him anyways. But I still have the urge to do so. What should I do? And is it normal to keep thinking about our interactions? Because I can't imagine how other people do stuff like this if they always get attached afterwards.",Temporary_Cherry4036,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1ouhcvm,"I (27M) am interested in my coworker (35M) and I think he might be too, but our dynamic is weird.","Hi Reddit! I hope you're all having a lovely day. I meant to present you with a dilemma of mine in hopes of getting some sound advice. (tl;dr at the end just in case)

First of all, yes I know. ""Sound advice from online peeps? This dude must be joking"", I hear you say. But I'm sort of doing this as a last resort as the people around me have given me rather mixed opinions on this matter.

  
For context... I work for this big multilingual brand, been at it for two years. Spanish, english, korean, can do. Time went by and I, being a normal human being, had determined some of my co's were attractive, but it never went beyond that- and neither did I try any disrespectful advances towards them.

Y'see, I keep to myself *a lot*. I consider myself studious and well-read, I love my videogames, my music and poetry in my alone time. I love a good sci-fi or fantasy book, reading about foreign folklore, going for long walks, playing my guitar... lots of ""introverted"" interests, if you may. Now, that isn't to say I'm not personable- I actually feel I carry myself pretty well. But for the most part, I tend to be rather private, and enjoy my solitude.

However, the whole mystique sort of shifted a few months ago. We welcomed a new person on the team, and initially, I had thought, ""wow, he's my exact type"". The ""cute guy next door"", if you may: well-groomed hair, soft smile, average height, no bulk as he doesn't work out but has some volume because he's handy and has lots of physical talent. Raspy voice, always quick with a joke, and generally greets you with a smile if he has as much as learnt your name.

Initially I'd paid no mind to this. I was simply going with the motions, not talking much to him because, who cares, not like I want him for a relationship or anything- not like it could happen or anything, right? Well, *boy oh boy*. Was I so wrong.

**Things began taking a weird turn**. After we ever first talked, I noticed he would like to spend a lot of time next to me. Like, literally seeking me out from across the room and standing next to me, just watching me do my job. If I needed help with something, he'd be quick to raise his hand and go do it, even something as simple as me wanting some water.

The attention felt nice for a while, and I was riding it. But it slowly began scaling, until I realized I'd developed some feelings for him. I went over to a coworker I trust and told him about this, and he gave me a much broader perspective than I thought:

***This guy really pays attention to me***. Whenever we're on shift together, he'll make sure to pour coffee specifically because *he knows* I like coffee. He'll grab my cup and ask if I want anything to drink, he'll constantly seek out chances to talk to me, will bring me candy or anything sweet whenever he can, and offer only me it. Everyone seems to notice how caring and attentive he is to me.

Now, he and I have spoken personally, about many life-related topics. Existential in nature, even. We've asked each other our own philosophical questions, we've talked about our hopes and dreams, the past, the present and the future, and even about our exes. Which admittedly, I haven't many to go by.

With all that out the way... he's talked to me about girls. I know only a few weeks ago, he was seeing a woman, but he didn't want her for anything serious- and he explicitly told her that. He's been telling me how he, nowadays, feels no real connection to the women he hooks up with. Now again, he and I have grown close, so he comes talk to me about this stuff.

Me on the other hand, I've only ever had as much as a situationship going on, when I was 24, with another guy. *And it being a situationship*, you can imagine how difficult it was. Truthfully, I have never even made out with someone- not even kissed. My V-Card is still mine and mine only.

**I'm baffled I ever got myself in this situation**, because I truly never expected to develop feelings for this dude. But he's very attentive to me. If we message each other, he'll know when I've seen his messages, and immediately start writing back. He's offered to pick me up to and from work as well, and is constantly asking me to hang out with him for drinks after our shifts.

He's keen on asking a bunch of personal things to me, such as whether I've gotten closure from my ""ex"" (if you could call him that), or if I feel intimately attracted to guys, considering I haven't been involved with one after this long. I know for a fact he's never spoken about guys himself, only once where he jokingly thought of giving this other dude his number.

I dunno. Some of my friends say he's bi, and I've given him a space where he can finally explore that side of him. My other friends say he's just being nice to me because it's simply part of his character. *Worth noting as well*, he's divorced, and has a kid of his own. Currently, he's single- and from what I hear, quite ready to mingle.

**I suppose I would love some form of definitive advice. How should I continue to approach this situation now we've built this much rapport? Should I tell him anything about my feelings, or should I wait for him to say something? Am I imagining things, or is there something actually going on here? Have I got a fan-celebrity sort of dynamic here? A therapist-patient thing going?** I've cried so much over this stuff because I legitimately don't know lol. Some say mixed signals are a blatant no, others say mixed signals are a way of someone who is interested, *but fearful*, to test the waters.

Have any of you gone through anything similar? If so, what's the best advice I can get? I'm hoping to finally get over this, so I can go back to focusing on myself only. Thanks in advance, and thank you for reading :)

t3_1osaswx,Still have feelings for first crush 15 years later,"Hello, I’ve never posted on Reddit before but I’m not sure where else to turn at this point. I (29/f) still have feelings for my first crush (29/f) 15 years later. Here’s the situation - I met this girl when we were children but we didn’t get really close until high school. In high school we had a very close and confusing relationship. We spent almost every day together, texted each other romantic song lyrics, Skyped all night when we weren’t together, cuddled when we sat or slept next to each other, touched knees/thighs/feet under the table, etc. This was basically as far as things went, but I do believe she tried to kiss me once. I was laying on my back in her bed and she was straddling me and tickling me. She then stopped and leaned her head down towards me and I panicked and rolled out from under her. I think she was trying to kiss me but I don’t actually know that for sure because I gay panicked from all my internalized homophobia. There was also a time she asked me what my favorite word was. I responded with a random word and she responded “no, not like that” so I tried another word and she had the same response. I remember being very confused by this at the time, but then one day I was listening to “she keeps me warm” by Mary Lambert and the lyrics state “What’s your favorite word? Do you like kissing girls?” Is this what she was referring to?

Anyway, we were both involved in the church and as I mentioned earlier, I was dealing with a lot of internalized homophobia at the time. I felt disgusted with myself and I felt like I was betraying her by having romantic feelings for her so I ultimately pushed her away to protect her from my gayness. I think this really hurt her as her mother once told my mother “my daughter really misses op”. We went to different colleges and have only seen each other once every year or so since then. Every time I see her she is very friendly, we hug for longer than normal when we first see each other (sometimes for a few minutes), she’s very touchy with me, etc. One of the last times I saw her she invited me to go into the bar bathroom with her but I panicked and said no. Dumb!!

I am openly gay and have dated multiple women publicly. As far as I know, she has not expressed to anyone that she’s into girls in any way but she also has not publicly dated anyone ever. She did have a very close friendship with a woman in college and posted pictures that looked very relationship-y but that woman is now married to a man.

I am posting this because there is a good chance I will see her in the near future and I’m not sure the best way to approach things. I am very confident making moves on women that I know are queer, but I feel predatory when someone’s queerness isn’t crystal clear. Because of this, I think I have been waiting for her to make a move as she knows with certainty that I am gay. With that said, I’ve been bottling this up for so long that I feel I have to take some action to get clarity. Either we explore the connection or I get closure in knowing I misinterpreted things and she isn’t interested. I don’t want to live my life with the “what if?”, but I also don’t want to make her uncomfortable or ruin our friendship. Our families and friends all know each other so I feel like I can’t talk to anyone about this. Please help!",Prestigious_Web7668,Alcohol/substances,High

So, basically, I'm a ""freak"" who needs help because God forbid anyone try to enjoy their life for more than a day. I'm currently like, depressed (when am I not) and I have no idea what I'm doing here (hellpppp broooo). Some backstory about me, I am depressed and have like, a bajillion, (like 4) disorders, (not diagnosed but I ""show early/severe signs and symptoms"" of them). i have immense memory loss, masochism I didn't know I had til' like, middle school, I'm a hopeless romantic, people freak me out, I'm a nerd/weeb and I hate ppl and stuff. I was bullied (and still am) by people who think i'm weird WHEN I'M LITERALLY EXISTING TRYING TO CRAWL MY WAY THROUGH SCHOOL. Also, I can ""assume"" what people are thinking or how they are (I'm like 99% always right) And everything sucks. It's like the gods and Fates above go ""Oh hell no, she's enjoying her life, can't have THAT happening, boom, your life sucks now, lol"" (I'm also a Hellenistic polytheist because yes). Anyways so tip of the iceberg, I recently broke up with my bf (his name will be Twig.) and I'm lost as hell. Backstory, (yes, I talk and text a lot, deal with it.) So, Twig is a new kid in one of my classes and he sat next to me where one of my besties used to sit (he left for a dif school) and I saw the look on Twig's face, it was like ""Fuuuuuckkk duuude, noooo"". AND HE DRESSED LIKE A FRICKIN' POPULAR KID. ifykyk, and a cholo and shit and I'm like ""Damn you, life."" But he cute. I liked him, he was cute. So you have Twig, and me (Viscera bc that's a coolass name) a hoodie-wearing noob/weeb/nerd/AI chatter/""emo""/artist / WHATEVER ELSE YOU NORMIES CALL PEOPLE LIKE US next to him and I instantly hate/crush on him. I don't talk like, AT ALL so when my teacher told me to talk and help him, well, I made a face of what you would call a ""constipated face"" internally ofc. So I help him. Fast forward like, a week and we start talking and we're friends and shit, y'know I'm teasing him which apparently makes me a ""sadist"" (dunno how that works) and I tease him abt his drawings cause he says they're shit (pls don't bully me for spelling, chat im trying my best, existing is tireing, also, I'm speedrunning ts) and we're cool. So then one day we're talking and IDK HOW IT CAME TO THIS but he threatens to hold my hand and i go ""You won't, you won't"" AND SO HE DOES AND MY HEART IS CABUMPING ALL OVER THE PLACE, MY FACE IS RED, MY PALMS SEEM TO HATE ME BC THEN THEY FEEL CLAMMY AND SHIT, and then he say ""Holding your hand makes me..."" with like, a fucking pause and whatnot. Then we talk abt dating and he goes, ""Would you date me if I asked you"" and I say, ""Hell yeah"" while rubbing my (fake/imaginary wizard beard ((i actually do that) AS LIKE A JOKE, and then my gut turns bc I know dam well he actually likes me, so I panick and shiz. THEN I CANT STOP THINKIN ABT HIM AND I KNOW THAT I LIKE HIM BUT I HAVE VERY VERY VERY BAD romace and stuff, like, I have PTSD from my past crushes because literally all of them hated me, liked sum1 else, was dating, thought of me as a friend, wanted to (unexist) etc. AND ITS HARD FOR ME TO MOVE ON BC DEPRESSION IS SINKING IN AGAIN. So I don't do that and then the moment I dread: He asks me out. We're passing notes to each other (even tho we fucking sit next to each other TvT) during like, a project and we end up dating. But here's the thing, I knew it was a lie. In my mind Im like ""Nononononono, smth's wrong with him, why would he ask me out? LOOK AT ME! No, there's something going on or sum shit."" and so basically, he literally like, broke up w me saying ""I need space."" And ""I'm having family problems"" Like, NO TF YOURE NOT DUDE, WTF!? I've literally SEEN YOU with sum other girl. And its not even like the fact that he didnt like me anymore or family problems or that shit. Its about the fact that he couldnt trust me to tell me the truth. That he lied to me, because what? Because I ""couldn't handle it""? Because I was weak? So now hes dating another girl (shes in one of my classes ewww and HALP.) And I still like him even tho he hurt me and made me sad and anxious. And if he loved me as much as he said he did (he literally said ""I fell in love with you like love at first sight"") he wouldn't have said ""no"" when my friend sked him (out loud) if he was dating me. He said he panicked but even if he did panic, he would've said yes. He was clearly ashamed of dating ""someone like me"" because he lied. Sometimes I would try to talk to him and he would turn around, look at me dead in the eyes, HIS EYES WOULD HALF ROLL and he'd go ""What"". With ATTITUDE. We're still friends but idk, I need help. Sorry random strangers that I'm telling like, half of m life to, but I know what's wrong. I KNOW we're still ""young"" we have ""more to learn"" we're ""not mature"" we ""don't know what we're doing"" I KNOW THATS HOW IT SEEMS, but still. I need help. Don't tell me some shitty excuse like ""You're not ready"" or ""You should avoid"" blah blah blah- NO. I don't need that! I need someone, ANYONE to tell me that It's fine. That it's normal, that I'm okay, that it's not wrong to feel upset or whatever. (Sorry, im a lil' emotional lollllzzz) Anyways, yeah. SOS, chat (Idk what to do nor what I'm doing)

t3_1omjwpv,I need help understanding my situationship,"I (17M) still cant get over this girl I talked to. When we first started talking, I wasnt so sure about her, as we are both apart of the same friend group, but she seemed so interested in me that I decided I should at least get to know her. Well, the talking stage went smoothly, and after seeing eachother 2 times irl I realised I started to really like her and couldnt wait to see her again. Thing is, she went on this school trip for 3 days and had a fight with a friend of hers, which resulted in her pushing away everyone who was close to her, including me. I asked her why she was so quiet on the last day of the trip and thats when she told me she just wanted to be friends. Her reason was that on our first date she felt like she was doing all the talking and that we didnt make that big of a connection, but I thought it went great. I suggested that we go out one more time and get to know eachother better, and she only agreed to do it as friends (this was kind of desperate of me, I realised it the next day) Now, a day later she texts me like nothing happened and asks me what im up to (I dont think thats how you text a ""friend""). Thats when our second convo started, when I told her I cant act like nothing happened the day before. She then asked me why I want to go out one more time then, and I told her I thought about it and it wouldnt be that good of an idea. We then talked a little more and she admitted she was too quick to decide that we didnt make a strong connection and she apologised, but she never said for us to start talking again as I hoped she would. At this point I was sure that she really did just want to be friends, but then we also had short chats the next 2 days. Now, these 2 chats made me believe that she still wasnt over me either but didnt know how to tell me, but my friend said she texted me just because she didnt have anyone else to talk to at the time (she was at a wedding). I also asked the other people in the friend group if they talked to her in dms, and they all said no, including the girl that she went on the trip with and was her closest friend. This girl also told me she thought we (me and the girl i dated at the time) looked like we had lots of fun together. Anyways, those were our last chats in dms. This whole week there was no school, and because I had nothing to do I would always think of her and thats why I havent moved on. But it seems like it had the opposite effect on her: shes been out of town all week and even though she said she wants to be friends, she has been sending me less and less tiktoks and responded very dry when I asked her how the trip was. Now I dont know what to think anymore. I keep saying she treated me with the avoidant attachment thing back when she friendzoned me (because the signs are there, why did she try talking to me normally the next 3 days??), but now she actually started to move on and I fumbled her. Am I delusional for still caring so much about her? Im thinking of sending her one final tiktok with a caption like ""I miss you"", but that would probably make our whole friend group awkward whenever we see eachother irl, and she might also find it weird and creepy how I still havent moved on from her, right? Next week school starts again, and the whole friend group might meet eachother friday. Should I wait till then and see how she behaves around me, and maybe look for a way to have one final 1 on 1 chat with her?",New_Newspaper5026,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1oivau3,"Plz help, guy i’ve been talking to apparently got post nut clarity, what are your opinions on this story?","Me and this guy have been talking about 4 months now,(F20 M19) and we both reassured our intentions of wanting a relationship before talking, no casual sex or hookups. For reference, we both have only had one past relationship, and he never gave me any signs/ red flags of him being a F boy or just wanting me for one thing, i’ve met
his friends and family members and he always talks highly of me and in a loving manner. Things have been going well we’ve went on numerous dates, talk throughout the day, have each others locations, and call often between work or class. 

Until, recently for the past week or so i’ve been seeing wayyyyy him more often(daily if not every other day, compared to when we used to hang out once maybeee twice a week), and while he does reassure me that he wants to soon make it official, it seems likes every time we are with each other we are having sex almost the whole time we are with each other.

Also it’s not just one round before I leave or in the heat of the moment, It’s back to back to back (I mean maybe 2 minutes in between i’ve never had a man go 5 rounds and not get soft or take a break once), every time we are laying down or just relaxing watching a show all we do is fuck. I’ve told him i want to snuggle for a bit or watch the show, but maybe 5 minutes pass and he’s touching on me, which i can’t lie many times i give in unless i’m super tired, mostly it’s me wanting to please him, but also i’ve always been told I have a really high sex drive for a female which is why this has me even more concerned. 

I’ve never had sexual relations with a guy like this, i’m so used to being able to keep up with all my exs and past relations. Does he just have a really high sex drive, or is this more of a sex addiction issue? This is my other big question, the other night i went to his house for a few hours and of course, we had sex, everything was fine he was acting normal after I left and after sex. But, the next day he was being super short, taking a long time to reply and didn’t call me once or update me on his day once (which is so normal for us to do), he claimed later that night he was having post nut clarity the night before, which is something that he’s never said before and he’s never acted like this, ever. Also, we’ve been having sex for weeks wouldn’t this be something that would come about earlier? And would it last through the night and all day? 

I’m just so confused and lost, we had so many heart to hearts because I’m so used to being lusted over and wanted for my looks or body. That was one of the topics i would bring up often, he promised me he would never think to hurt me and he always reassures me in the best ways, but again who am i to believe any words that come out of a man’s mouth. I have a feeling he thought he’d want a relationship but the lust is slowly wearing off and now he’s just keeping me around him for sex. Advice or any insight would be appreciated.",No-Panda3950,Alcohol/substances,High
t3_1ol5m8k,I need help understanding what I am doing wrong,"Hi,

This is going to be long, but hopefully someone here will read it and help me. I'm 25(M) and I've never been in a relationship ever. I've never kissed a woman, held someone's hand, or gone on a date. No woman has ever really shown interest in me to my knowledge and I get rejected a lot. For some context, I'm Indian living in the US in a place where there are lots of people just like me so it's not a racial thing. Most of the time, it's me wanting to date women of my own culture but sometimes other cultures I try. I was born and raised in the US and I also hold a university degree in very difficult STEM field with an extremely high GPA and hopes for grad school. I currently have a decent job and it makes good money. No, I don't have any mental health or physical ailments. I am 6'5"" and I started the gym about 1.5 years ago. I've made good progress with the help of friends and I go consistently on a PPL split 5-6 days a week. I'm not shredded, but you can see the muscles shaping my body. I have lots of hobbies like writing, photography, kayaking, dirt bikes, etc. I love to get out and make the most of each day (I hate sitting in my room!) and I volunteer a lot at different places in my community just to help out.

Now some more background, I was bullied a lot when I was a kid in both elementary and high school by different groups of people (I moved so when I went to high school no one from my old school went there). It sucked, it hurt a lot and sometimes it still kinda bothers me as childhood trauma because I was just trying to fit in. I often was excluded from things and ostracized by others. Again, it's not a race thing, most of the people at my school ere the same race and treated me poorly. I did manage to make some friends which are still my friends today so at least I know they are real and because of bullying I became more academically inclined because I pretty much missed out on the entire high school experience. I don't drink or vape or do any drugs and I never have.

Now comes my problem, I've never been in a relationship. Ever. I've been on dating apps for 5 years, constantly upgrading my profile, remaking it, taking new photos, having my friends help me and it's all for nothing. I went on a trip with my friends and I got some really good photos all my friends were saying are great dating apps. For more context, I'm not weird around women or awkward. All my friends have girlfriends and they all think I'm nice and really fun to hang out with when we're in a group and I like to talk and get to know other people's interests. Nevertheless, I haven't gotten anywhere. I like to go out with my friends to clubs or other places and I never get anyone looking at me. I overhauled my wardrobe too and I got new clothes to create outfits that I can wear when I go out and I spent all this money and I see no difference. Dating and relationships was one of the major reasons I joined the gym and now that I have a decent physique paired with being tall, I still don't see anything.

At the club, I do approach women and ask to buy them a drink or dance and I've always ben rejected. Sometimes in very harsh ways and I get it, woman are apprehensive about guys at the club and that's fair, so I'm not the type to like ask twice or be weird that. I just accept it and move on and have a good night with my friends. I just wish tho that people were nicer. One time, I asked to get a girl a drink at the bar at a club because she was standing there (obv I started a convo with her first and asked her name and how her night was going, etc.) and her friend grabbed my arm and told me to get lost like I was some creatin. What hurt the most was that I bought new jeans that day and spent like $100 on them and I was so confident when I went to the club and just got absolutely crushed. It hurt more because that same girl and her friends joined our group (my friends and I) on the dance floor and at that point I just went home because I was like wtf. I just didn't understand.

My friends get a lot more women than I do. Every one of them has dated or been in a relationship. Some have broken up with heir gfs and gotten new gf before I even get into my first relationship. As busy in a friend group we tend to make a lot of jokes about one another just for laughs and my friends have made jokes about me not getting any women and I laugh along, but deep inside I feel stuck. I know they sound like horrible people for doing that, but they're not. They try to help set me up with their gf's friends or help me take photos and give me fashion advice, recommend barbers (I finally found a good one) and others things, but to no avail. My best friend even tried setting me up with his girlfriend's best friend, and she was okay with it until she saw a picture of me. Maybe I'm ugly. I don't have any facial deformities or injuries or scars. I have an even face if anything, and I'm average in that regard. I could grow a denser beard although my beard is alright. This was when. I just started working out like a month into the gym so it could've been my body? I don't know but I've come a long way since then.

This wasn't the only time a friend has tried setting me up and failed. Regardless, I feel stuck.  Everyone else has passed me in this regard and I'm lonely. My family doesn't know I struggle this much with dating. My parents and siblings tell me to find a girlfriend and I just smile through it and tell them I'll do it after I get into grad school or that I'm too busy right now, but truthfully, I'm miserable. I lay in bed and stare at the ceiling wondering if there is anyone out there or maybe I'm just not relationship material. Maybe I'm hard to love? I'm a fixer, so if I see a problem I want to fix it. I did that with my body, my clothes, my facial hair, my social skills but it all feels useless. I see guys out here who never hit the gym, don't have the six pack/shredded body or the nice beard or the discipline to go to school, or the job, or the degree, some of them are complete crash outs with no prospects with a life that revolves pretty much around drinking, smoking, gambling and their dating lives are amazing. I'm not trying to judge, but I think about and I'm like what I doing wrong and I'm frustrated. I don't get what I am missing. Meanwhile, I do all those things, tick off all the boxes and I'm just alone. Do I need to start drinking? or gambling? or stop going to the gym and leading a healthy lifestyle? Do I have to quit my job and stay home playing video games all day? What is it? I'm literally going insane trying to figure it out.

My friends tell me I just have to wait when I get into genuine conversations regarding ym dating life. I feel like I can't talk to them normally anymore because when I do they just tell me, just wait, or give me the same advice of new photos or clothes which I've already wasted money on or that it'll happen or I should wait until I get my final career after grad school and women will want me then because I'll be established. I fear that last point, to be loved for money or what I can give. I see guys all around me who don't have anything going for them but they're still loved. Is that what it takes for me, to be loved for what I can provide and not who I am? That scares me right down deep inside that I'll never be loved for who I am. I don't want to be someone's backup plan or second choice or safe option because the man of their dreams bailed on them. I don't want to find out years into relationship that someone picked me because their dreams with another person never worked out.

Even right now, I'm on a cut, trying to get down to 200 lbs so that my abs and muscles will be lean and I'll look good physically,  but in the back of my head I keep thinking, what if nothing changes then either. What if, even after all this hard work of improving my body, social skills, style, that none of this works and then there's nothing left to change or improve and I've reached my limit. Then what? Do I just stop?

I'm scared. I'm alone. Some people might just tell me, be myself and it'll happen. Am I just supposed to wait in the void hoping to meet someone like in the movies? I feel like at this point I've become cold about it all. Like if someone told me they liked me, I wouldn't believe them or that I must be their second choice.

I just need some help, maybe just anything because I'm close to saying fuck it and just being alone.",Broad_Extension2605,Alcohol/substances,High
t3_1ohm0h7,I got random terrible jealousy and insecurities towards my gf,"I 20m have been dating my girlfriend 19f for a little over a year now. I just want to get to the point but for a little backstory she is my first girlfriend and I am her first boyfriend. She is the first girl to genuinely ever treat me right and she loves me and wants a future with me and I want my future with her. She was my first time with not everything but with sex and I lost my virginity very fast into us talking. She had already sex with a few people before me and it never really bothered me like yes I was always jealous that someone had her before me and that we couldn’t have that special moment for the first time together but it never really felt like a issue. This is until around may/June I started to think about her past more and more and focus more on it then I ever did or have before. Then it turned into everyday then every hour then a constant thing in the back of my mind. I don’t understand nothing even happened to make this such a horrible problem in my head. It’s gotten to the point where I have developed depression from and am now on medication and am thinking of starting therapy soon. I have brought it up to her and talked about it and she has reassured me that it was nothing like we have and it was never special at all with anyone she did it with. She also says she regrets it and it has been something she has talked to me about since before we dated on how much she regrets sleeping with other people and how she never wanted it and would do it just because they wanted to and she was very alone and depressed during this time of her life. It all happened within the spand of 6 months before we started talking and she is very emotional and upset at bringing it up and talking about it which is so understandable she regrets it hates that she did it and was something she didn’t want to do but did because these guys wanted it and sometimes where forcing it onto her which I’m not jealous when it comes to that but jealous of the other times. Idk if my overthinking and jealousy has gotten worse because she has talked to me about it and shared information on it because it bothers her and she needs to talk and get it off her chest or if it’s because we have been dating for a year and so the thought of her being with me for life but knowing she has had other people be so close and intimate with her just rubbes me the wrong way for some reason now like idk. But it’s gotten so bad I get so jealous and overthink everything. I know I have terrible personal insecurities and am insanely insecure but it didn’t used to be like this. Every time I see a guy in public and she even looks in there direction my stomach drops. She scrolls on TikTok and likes a TikTok of a boy and it’s not sus it’s not a thirst trap just like one about music or literally anything in life my stomach drops. I know the people she slept with in her past I don’t look like them I’m not muscular I didn’t play sports I didn’t have experience in my past. I am not the biggest size down there but she tells me I have the perfect best d she has ever had but has talked about how with this other guy it was big and hurt her. Like what am I supposed to do but overthink that and feel insecure or think why are you telling me this. The overwhelming overthinking feelings in me will be the death of me. It never stops and again it’s gotten to the point where I’m on depression medication and am thinking of therapy.

I’m sorry I know this is long and I’m rambling I can explain more if needed but is this normal? Why did this just randomly start? There was nothing wrong with our relationship of course we have both made mistakes (lying, not being as loving to each other and having bad days) but like nothing that would be this bad. Sometimes I look at her and I just be mad and I can’t look at her sometimes because I’m scared she just wants these other guys or that I’m not muscular enough or handsome enough or good in bed. Again I want it to be known I love this girl and want her in my life and future and couldn’t even imagine my life without her but I need advice. So again is this normal and what can I do to help me with this. Thx",Little_Middle1456,General consent ambiguity,Medium
t3_1oh1s6s,Am I overthinking??,"Ok so I need some advice or someone to tell me im not overthinking.

So I just graduated college a few months ago. I have been snap chatting this guy as friends for about a month before I graduated but I knew him as acquaintances for month before that. He is two years younger than me. After I graduated he was starting to become more flirty with me and would complement me all the time. I was hesitant at first because he is younger than me and he just got out of a relationship. I decided to flirt back with him which turned into more steamy conversations. We would also talk about our days and things we like and all that stuff. We both told each other that we weren’t ready for a relationship at that time because he just got out of one and I was traveling around the country every few weeks for grad school. But we both said that we wanna keep talking to each other because we had a thing for each other. This was about 4 months ago. 

We have talked everyday for the past 4 months, we are each others number one best friends on snapchat for 3 months now. There have been multiple times where he would talk to be about OUR future together which was very confusing to me. We were excited to finally hangout one on one because I was moving back to our college town for 3 months. 

At this point, I have been back for a month. The first week I moved back we hung out 3 times. The first time we just talked and hung out which was very refreshing. The second time we finally kissed but I did not want to do anymore and he respected that and said he did not mind waiting. The third time we finally went all the way and I was very happy about it and he seemed to be too. The next week we continued to talk like normal we just didn’t see each other because I was working a night schedule and he had classes and work during the day. 

The third week I asked him to hangout and he said that he was super busy but would make the time to see me. He did not make the time. I let this go because we aren’t dating and I get that he was busy. I felt that he was also taking longer to respond to my snapchats and was just much more dry with his conversations. 

But this past weekend I saw him at a party and we said hi to each other but that was pretty much it. We would pass each other and smile but never really talk. Later that night he said bye to me and my friend as he was walking out the door with two other girls. He also left my snapchat on delivered for 18 hours but finally snapchatted me back with a blank picture of his face. 

I need advice on if I should give him the benefit of the doubt or if I need to cut things off before he does. I cannot read this situation and do not know if I am overreacting. I am so tired of feeling like I am being used for my body and that my personality is not good enough. He has always been super sweet to me and others even before we started talking. We were talking to each other for 5 months. I understand we were not dating and said that we were not ready for a relationship, but we also said that months ago. I can’t be this delusional to think that it didn’t mean anything.",Fun-Entrepreneur3712,Mixed signals,High
t3_1oh0nsq,Why do men keep saying that modern women’s standards are too high?,"28F from London. I'm hearing men constantly say that modern women only want men who are really tall, have lots of money, and are exceptionally good-looking. This is BS. I don't know a single woman who is out with these kinds of men. I've never dated a man who has lots of money. Sure, some of them have been tall and attractive, but they just have normal jobs. I don't think modern women’s standards are too high at all. Modern women have simply become too preoccupied with their careers and education and don't have much empathy towards men.

t3_1ofoam9,My story?,"Context: college started 2 months ago. Im 18. 

So… it all started pretty normally. There’s this girl in my class — let’s call her K. From the start,I didn't really know her but she called me the day we exchanged contact asking if we wanted to go home together and I was like okayy but sadly our train time mismatched and I went alone . she was one of the few people I actually vibed with. She’s got this energy bomb personality — always smiling, laughing, talking to everyone, super social. I don’t usually click with people easily, but with her it was smooth. We started talking, joking, sharing stuff, and it was fun.(I didn't initially know she was like this with everyone)

At one point, she even called me up to come to the top of the water tank at college — it’s this spot at the very top of the campus. When I went there, it was her, her friend, her friend’s boyfriend, and me. It wasn’t anything deep but it felt kinda nice.we talked and talked.

Then came that train story. We were both going home on the same train. Initially, she said her guy friend was coming to meet her at Kottayam station, so I didn’t ask her again if she wanted to go together. But then that plan got cancelled, and somehow we decided we’d go together. She had a sleeper ticket, I had general. We were talking nonstop — about random things, laughing and all. She even asked me to get on sleeper with her and see what happens if TT comes. When TT came, he told me to get down and move to general. It was packed — I was literally hanging. Then she texted, “Why did you go? You could’ve stayed. It feels bad here, it’d have been better if you were here.”
Later she got a berth and we met again, talked, shared reels… till TT came again and I had to leave. That night was weirdly nice.

Then after I reached home, we were still sharing reels. She’s a BMW girl — obsessed with them. She sent a reel about BMW headlights . I said the only eyes i falls for. She replied, “What about your future girl?” . I was like well she'll have to compete . she said she only knows one girl who could overcome it . I asked who? She replied,""herself"". I was like “Ohoo but you wanna put yourself that high?” in a fun way.

Later, a voice note came from her account — sounded like a kid saying “Who are you chatting with K, she’s mine.” I just laughed and sent back a voice note too.

Anyway, after that, things just kept getting deeper in my head. I noticed how much I was depending on her attention. Like, I’d send reels and keep waiting for her to reply, and if she didn’t, I’d get pissed. We had a week break and after coming back to hostel . I noticed how attached I got after a few days and honestly I hated it.while my messages were left on delivered other guys (yup plural) had 4+ messages from her.

Then there was that tea scene. We were all sitting together. I was kinda pissed and not feeling included, so I was just scrolling manhwa. She took my phone and told me to stop looking at that and be here. But when I didn’t react much, she got up and went and sat near another guy. I was angry but kept quiet.

There were also these dance practices — we had to do “Oppana” for a program. I was the bride in it (yeah, imagine that), and she was helping me with the shawl — literally close, fixing it in my face, breath and all that. I didn’t show anything, but yk, those moments stick.

After that, everything started mixing — some days we’d talk like crazy, other days she’d vanish mid-conversation. And when she’d talk to other guys, I’d get pissed. I knew I was getting attached.

One day, she sent a reel saying “One loyal friend is better than 100 relatives,” and i reacted to it .later we all met . And she was like “Haha sorry it wasn't for you but for someone else.” That one stung.

There was also this phase where she started acting more distant — like, I’d react to reels, she wouldn’t reply. Or she’d send reels but I’d see her sending the same ones to others. Guys in class even joked that she spams everyone. That made me feel like a fool. I personally only send reels or messages to people I actually care about and I don't run some charity work where I make sure EVERYONE'S plate is filled.

I started muting her, then unmuting her, because I didn’t wanna miss if she texted something important. But honestly, it was all just messing with my head.

Then I started feeling like I was only there for her when she needed a reaction or attention. Like, she’d say things like “You don’t have to chase love, it’ll come to you,” but then be all over everyone else.

At one point I even told myself, “I’m done.” But then she’d call me or say something nice and I’d melt again. Classic push and pull.

Then there was that thing with her ex texting her — she was really upset. I noticed just from a few texts that something was off, and I asked what happened. She said her ex had texted. I called her, and we talked. I actually calmed her down — told her to ignore/block him, that she was doing fine without him, not to fall back into that trap. She sounded better by the end. And weirdly, that call made me feel happy, like I mattered.

Then came the outing. T (her close friend) called me saying K’s mom wasn’t letting her go and told me to convince her. I was surprised, like why me? But I called. She said her mom said no, I told her to try again, that the place wasn’t far, that if she didn’t come, T wouldn’t, and then we’d all probably cancel. In the end, she asked her dad and got permission.

The trip itself… man. I decided before going that if she didn’t act different, I’d move on. But once we got there — it was this shallow waterfall, super chill vibe. She was shy at first, but we made her get in the water. Then she just started having fun — lying under the fall, playing around. She held my hand a few times when it was slippery. She held others’ too, but with me, it felt… longer? I don’t know.

Then she sat next to me for a bit, we talked, took selfies, even a shadow video of just the two of us walking. But later, at lunch, she sat opposite to another guy (A). I was like, “Yeah, this is probably it.”

After that, we went to practice with T. She and I talked a lot while T was watching reels. By a lot I mean 3-4 hours .She even turned my face toward her when I looked away once. That tiny move stuck with me.

That night we texted — like, actual chatting, which never happened before. I sent a reel about a dad asking a guy his intentions with his daughter, and the guy teaching her drifting. She said she didn’t need that, just the BMW key. I said, “Is one enough?” She said, “If he can do that much, I’m fine.” I said I’d take a BMW and go on a long trip, she said, “Invite me too.” I replied, “Why should I? You have your man.” She said, “Man, don’t turn me down.” Then at 1:30 a.m., she called. I was half asleep. She asked what I was wearing — said it was a dare from her friends. Weird, but I played along.

Then, next day, things felt… different. Like a shift. She was normal, talking and all, but something in the air was off. I couldn’t pinpoint it.

Then came UTIR. I tried to be around but not depend on her. But watching her talk to others, being cheerful and playful with everyone, it messed with me. So I called Aya — a friend who knew everything — and said, “I need backup.”

Aya came with her friend, and she played the role perfectly — holding my hand, laughing, being close, making it look like I’d moved on. And honestly, it worked. I could see that K noticed.

It rained. Everyone was under one umbrella, and I was just standing there getting drenched. They invited me in later, but it was already packed. On the way back, the ground was slippery, and K held my hand again — I let go a bit to see if she’d hold on, and she did.

Later, we met a robotics senior, young guy. We teased him about being with girls from another department. Then he turned to us and asked if we were a thing. She immediately said “Nooo, we’ll never be a thing.” He laughed and said, “Yeah yeah, people who say that always end up being one.” He even joked if I’d proposed and I said, “Nah, maybe I’ll propose during Ritu.” We laughed it off.

Then I met Aya again while walking with K and she said, “Looks like your backup worked.” I laughed it off too. When I went back to K, I was giggling and asked her to continue what she was saying earlier, and she mockingly imitated my giggle.

t3_1oe6pwm,Smoking has caused a rift in my relationship.,"Two nights ago, me and my partner got into an argument about substances. He both smokes weed and vapes. I personally do not support that, however I understand that people do it for a multiple of different reasons and I would support someone who actively wants to stop. Here incomes the problem. When me and my partner first got together he told me that he wanted to quit. I personally have had issues with self harm and drinking in the past so I am very open with mental health and chose to support him. In the beginning it was hard and he would often lie to me about being sober until I would find out normally by accident. This caused major trust issues in our relationship and I admit I did look through his phone to see if he was lying to me about anything else. After this he agreed to be honest with me about smoking as long as I don’t get upset. 

Back in August I got into an argument with a very close friend of mine. I will call her A. Long story short we aren't friends anymore and this was a rough point in my life I relapsed in both my drinking and self-harm. When I went to my boyfriend to seek support, he was initially supportive but the next day I found out he ended up smoking that night. When I confronted him about it, he told me in my words “I was extremely stressed due to what you told me” I felt as if he blamed me and my mental health problems for his relapsing or as an excuse. 

His friends and family are aware of him trying to stop however they have still offered him stuff.

2 nights ago, during the fight when he brought up wanting to smoke again, I was trying to compromise with him. I told him how about you only smoke when your friends give it to you, or when you ask. To that he told me no and stated “What if I need it when I am home”. I was extremely upset about this because we both agreed to stop drinking,smoking, self harming etc so I told him would he be okay if I started to drink and self harm if I allowed him to smoke. To which he said he didn't care.

I know him and I don't believe he doesn't care about me. I just feel as if he really wants to smoke and it is clogging his brain and not letting him think. 

How do I properly go around this conversation? I feel really disrespected but I don't want to leave him because I know he has his own stuff going on. ",Longjumping_Fig4190,Alcohol/substances,High

t3_1o7g2l3,Girlfriend Yelled at Me first Time we Had Sex and other things...,"Hello,

  
This is a long post but I need support to know what you think of this situation. Am I being unreasonable? Am I being manipulated? Am I being to harsh? 

  
Story: I started dating this woman 2 months ago (not committed to a relationship yet). Our dating has mostly been good outside of two arguments where we've had conflict. In the first one, we mostly resolved it but there was a moment when I didnt agree with where we landed. 

  
The second started on a day where we were gonna have a date. I planned the date and found the spot and was going to take her out. We get on the phone in the morning and everything is fine until she randomly starts saying "" I am mad at you"" I think shes joking at first then I ask and shes not so I say why. She says "" Because I miss you and haven't seen you"" I saw her last for the weekend but the last few days have been crazy. (I told her at the top of the month Oct was gonna be hard - moving, life stuff, school) but we talk every night and text everyday. I said in response ""Aww I get that I miss you too and I like you and cant wait till tonight"". She then says ""thats not what I wanna hear"" and I saw ""Okay I am kinda confused not sure what you want me to do at this point."" We then hang up and she send a text saying ""I am going to be irrational anytime go long periods without seeing you so you gotta learn to navigate that"". I write back that I understand having the feelings and I miss you too but I shouldnt have to mange emotional reactions of you. and sometimes we wont see eachother for a bit due to life stuff. And I feel misaligned on that"" We go into this disagreement where she says me saying I felt misaligned was threatening the relationship (when I was talking about the 5 day thing) I  understand my words weren't the best choice but I wasn't talking about our relationship. I even started the message by saying ""I wanna be honest about something cause I care about u and wanna see this through"" And ended it with ""So how can we get on the same page cause I dont wanna feel like this and I dont want you to"" So I feel like shes assuming what my words mean in a way thats not literally what I said. So then I say ""I just dont think the same emotions come up for me when we go 5 days because we had plans today and usually do by that time and we talk and text everyday and feel connected. Not to say your feelings aren't present and real - its just different for me. Plus I was excited to see you later. so again how can we both get to same page and not feel this way.

  
Then she just says ""okay be misaligned"" And goes on to say Im ruining her day and says I have an aversion to intimacy and its perfectly normal she wants to spend time with the person she is dating when I never said it wasn't. So she basically puts words in my mouth ALOT in these arguments. Then she says I am taking this overboard and for me to have a good life. She then cancels the date.  She then says I am being a jerk (she calls me names alot when we disagree - jerk, asshole) even tho I never do that to her. Then we get on the phone and she continues to say ""why did I cancel the date"" and I look at her like she is crazy because she canceled the date!!! And she wont admit it. She then goes on to say in that moment she wanted me to be affectionate and I wasn't. I say how is saying "" I miss you and I wanna see you"" not affectionate. She says she wanted me to do something about it - like meet in person. I say wtf because we were going out that night. 

It just snowballed from there. She keeps calling me an avoidant person when I respond, I show up, I am not perfect, but when I said I needed space to think for a bit after she basically gaslight me she said I was being avoidant and she didn't appreciate how I was treating her. 

  
Another thing - I told her I was feeling sex anxiety because I hadn't been with someone in a while and was nervous. Also she wanted sex often. We tried and it was going well but I was only getting her close to coming but not actually getting her there. I went down to try again and it was better but wasn't totally right yet because its our first time - she then yells at me in frustration ""Stop changing things, do it this way!!"" and I just freeze. I have never had someone yell at me. I brought it up later and she apologized and it felt like a good apology but I dont trust her. She then passively through it my face that I have issues with sex in an argument later. like wtf. 

Shes always like joking if I dont text for a while (few hours) ""oh you hate me..."" IT IS A JOKE because of her tone and her personality but imagine hearing that over and over again as a partner. Then she'll do this thing where I'm like ""no I dont I was just busy cutie"" and she'll be like ""no, i dont belive you"" all in a again a joking tone but still doing it frequently. To the point where I'm like What is going on??? and sometimes I share things and she doesn't comment on them or sometimes the convo is mostly on her side (that could be my fault).I dont mind that cause I am an introvert but I kinda hope for my partner to do that more naturally. 

  
Lastly she asked me to consider what I want later down the line (lightly it wasn't with pressure just a q) but she said she wanted to live with a partner. I said I didnt want that and would rather live with friends in an intentional community. I know I have always wanted this. I be upfront with her about this and she says we should stop seeing eachother then 10 mins later on the phone she says ""Why cant I talk this through with her and see if it can work still"" I say how can it work cause you just said and have been saying multiple times that what you want and I dont see how that changes so fast (maybe cause she likes me and would consider it) but I dont want someone building to resent me later down the line and how do you change your mind so fast? Also she wants to see 3 days if not more outta the week ad she puts it ""jokingly but also some truth - I wanna take up 50/60 percent of your free time"" so this all started because she misses me and wants to see me more but before that we were seeing eachother 2 days sometimes 3.. Like i cant do more than that. 

  
I feel like these are real incompatibilities that are stressing me out. Were not even in a relationship yet and this is all happening. I dont wanna get into arguments about time commitments. Or have someone say ""you just dont know what you want ur avoidant etc) I understand I dont wanna throw it all away but this feels bad. Like what was she trying to gain from that whole ""Im mad at you"" crap. She says shes not allowed to be irrational sometimes and I get that but why are you playing mind games. I know I can be better on my side but this feels like alot.

t3_1o9rj24,One night stand / dating advice,"Hey! This is a burner account so please don't call me a bot and I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to ask this. If its not please lmk! 

I'm 29F and haven't been in the dating sphere for a long time. The last time I had sex was when I was 25 and it wasn't quite what I had thought.
The sex wasn't what I wondered about  it was leaving so soon after.
 In college it made sense b/c I was at parties and honestly I went back to partying after lol but there were also times we would sleep after and i would walk home early in the AM. Think early 00's style walk of shame but I loved it!
 After college, ( I know this will sound silly) I thought dating would be more like in movies.
 A one night stand would be going out for drinks or meeting at a club ect., go back to one of your places, have safe sex, and whoever doesn't live there gets up in the morning and goes home. 
I thought the rude thing was to leave or kick the other person out right after sex, is that not correct? 
Have I just met shitty men or am I expecting a fantasy? 
I don't want to imply that I want something serious or even a friendship in some cases just because I would prefer to spend the night and sleep together after sex. 

So I guess what I'm asking the void here is, is being expected to head out soon or right after sex what most men expect now? 
Obviously I'm going when asked to leave or am told an Uber was called lol but is that what I should expect to be the normal one night stand?",Melodic-Cucumber3983,General dating / relationship,Low

t3_1nyqg1j,"I (26 M) think I messed up a bit at the end, as I tend to sometimes.","I (26 M) decided to screw my insecurity and other terrible thoughts, so I decided to go out there and give it a shot at dating in general. My friend suggested we should go to volleyball as I'll get to meet a lot of new people there. So, I'm at this volleyball court during the weekend and start talking to random people and its going good like asking them if they play here regularly, they must be good in playing and all, do they live here, are they studying or working, etc.

I took the courage to talk to this woman, and we were just talking normally as friends do and trying to get to know her; by the way, she works in a restaurant close to my work place; I even spoke to her friend about this woman's cooking skills since she mentioned she's into cooking and all and her friends love it (kind of teasing). Everything was going 'kinda' well, and I asked what she does for fun or if she's into board games (since I and my friends usually play them every weekend like Catan), and she's like yeah kind of and its fun but Catan is tough to play since it needs a lot of strategy (true though). I then asked her if she would like to play with us sometime coz we play regularly and it'll be fun, she's like I'll see maybe.

Now, this is where I think, I messed up. She was leaving with her friends, so I don't know why I was trying to get her number or socials, but I just told her 'I can teach you and you'll be good in no time, since I've played so many times' and she's like ok cool, she'll let me know and just went home, but I think it seemed like yeah ok weirdo, you look desperate and I don't think we'll meet again.

God, I've been regretting saying this the next day i.e. today and I wanted to vent this out here. I think I can talk about a lot of stuff, keep the conversation going, but 'ending' is what I tend to mess up and then I realize and regret the next day that I should've said this and that, now she may think ew.

I genuinely want to improve my skills with women and I'm all ears to suggestions and corrections (and go ahead you can say I'm a douche bag) as to what I can do better the next time.

EDIT: I didn't have my phone with me at the time since I kept it away from the courts outside, so I didn't have any opportunity to grab her IG or number (I don't even know how to ask for that as well)",ankurbanerji3,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1nz0zy6,is this more then friendship?," (28 f) lesbian have met my coworker (28f) bisexual girl few months ago. We started working together and we added eachother on social media. Since then we have intense texting and really intense friendship. We hangout a lot, we also fight a lot over small things also we fight a lot since we met. Those fights are constant since begining of our friendship sometimes she initiates it sometimes me, but they are usually really emotional fights and they are looking a lot like people who are in relationship having a fight.

Also I am not sure am I delulu or we flirt with each other but in joking way? We tease each other a lot in way like ,,making fun of each other'' When I dress up really nicely she often compliments me and one time we wrote 10 things what we like on each other and she called me ,,sexy'' . I think it is little weird to use a word ,,sexy'' for a friend. We never cross a line and she never tells me how she really feels about me or does she have any deeper feelings, I am so confused. Tbh I think I emotionally fell for her because we texted each other literally 24/7 for 6 months. Also I do like her. When we are at work with other people I noticed we stare at each other more then we look at other people, and I never noticed that she compliments other female or male coworkers in same way as me, I feel like she is giving me special attention. Also in texting she would often send me a lot of videos of her doing stuff or what she bought in store etc.

But also she has a long distance boyfriend and her boyfriend is bisexual too, but they see each other maybe 2-3 times a year for a few days, so I am confused. She rarely mentions him but sometimes she mention him and they are togther for few years. Btw she never had girlfriend and she never mentions having any feelings for women, she only said that she is bisexual and she knows I am lesbian

Do you thinks that she is maybe into me and that there is something unspoken going on between us? Because I am not sure is it normal to text your NEW friend for like 24/7 constantly everday",Marie2121,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1ny9kao,Missed chance on a train (UK),"I didn’t know where to put this but needed to air it out somewhere so apologies if this is the wrong place. 

So I (M31) took a train back home yesterday for a few hours, I ended up sitting at an empty table, but across the aisle from me in the same but opposite seat was a woman (somewhere around 5 years older than me), dressed in all black, her hair was tied up and she was glued to her phone reading a book, from what I could tell. 

She was gorgeous and yet mysterious.

Several times while we were sitting, I caught her glancing at me and she caught me looking at her. She got up from her seat to go to the toilets at one point and came back, as I noticed her walking towards me, I looked up and she was staring directly at me.

Normally, I don’t notice attention that others give me, at least, I don’t interpret it in a positive light anyway. I had a rough childhood, teen and young adulthood with relationships and dating.

Anyway the time moves on, she lets her hair down and adjusts it for some time in her phone, twirling a strand between her fingers as the glances continue. 

I’m sat questioning everything, is it just coincidence, is she hinting, should I say something but what do I say, I can’t think of an opener. 

The train is pulling into my stop, I get up and gather my belongings, she doesn’t move, so I assume that’s it. I was wrong, she got up and followed me to the doors and made a comment about how early I’d gotten up. That was it, that was the starter we needed. We chatted for a while as we walked through the station, smiles and nervousness from both of us, but we were both rushing and didn’t have time to swap names or anything, I was certain at this point that it was more than just small talk given all the signs on the train and through a lack of my own inaction. 

What I did gather is that she works potentially on the same ward as my sister in the hospital, so I’m hoping that this isn’t the final time that our paths cross. ",[deleted],Power imbalance,High
t3_1nxl6w9,FWB or Platonic Friendship,"This is super long, I’m sorryyy. But I need advice I went on a hinge date after moving to new city, and I’ve never been more confused  not sure if I’m just stupid or what. I’m 26(F), and I recently went on a date with a guy(32). I’m very shy, so I don’t really go on dates because it’s draining. Anyway we’re going to call him (Chris). Chris and I really hit it off he was very attentive, and sweet. We talked for about 4-5 hours during the date and then he asked what I was looking for, I told him I was looking for a relationship, but not really rushing into anything since I’ve been single for 3 years and I’m intentional. Anyway, he proceeded to say he just wants to be “friends” which in my head I didn’t consider he meant “fwb” so I quickly replied and said I’d like that, since we got along so well in my mind all I could think was a Platonic friendship without realizing the kind of generation we live in. Anyway, Chris and I have been going on “dates” and this is where I’m confused I guess. He buys me flowers, he always pays, he does not let me pay even if I offer (though if we’re “friends” that’s weird to me). He asks to see me often and hangout a lot. He’s never quite made any romantic or sexual Gesture toward me. We hug hello, and goodbye, but never really over step anything. Well every time Chris and I hang out we have hours long conversations, and when we go out we genuinely have so much fun. However he told me on our “second date” I was his first date in the city that we live. (We both moved here almost 2 years ago so we bonded on that). Which that left me confused, as to why I needed to know that. Also, he bought me a $200 concert ticket and surprised me with it randomly. He also asks me to hangout with his friends when they have get togethers. Then I am also meeting his sister because we’re going to meet up for a festival together in a couple weeks, and she’s going to be there. I am not sure how to read the situation or if I’m just dumb because I’ve been single for so long. I don’t mind being just friends because I do enjoy his company. Like I said we haven’t done anything romantic or sexual, no hand holding or kissing either. I would say the only thing is he hugged me from the back(hands on shoulders) at a concert we went to but yeah. Is this normal platonic behavior? I have 1 straight male friend but he doesn’t do any of this.  I need advice on how to interpret this situation. Is he just playing the long game to get me to hook up, and play nice guy? Or are we genuinely building a friendship and I’m just dumb? 
Also, not that this matters but he’s very attractive and wealthy so it’s not like he doesn’t have any “game”. ",Budget-Car360,General consent ambiguity,Medium
t3_1nrsstv,"I(25M) Like Her(24F), But I Don’t Know Where I Stand?","There is this girl(24F) that I(25M) like. She is actually my colleague. We are complete opposites, it's like she is everything I'm not. She is calm, composed, has great integrity, and a good eye for food that isn't Jain food.

She used to share photos of food she made that I liked, and she used to call me during lunch when she cooked something I liked.

I’ve been to her home at times to leave some of my stuff there. Even when she sent me food photos, or cooked something I liked and I asked when she was inviting me, she always said things like, ""You're always welcome,"" or ""Kab aa rahe ho aap?"" (When are you coming?)

We also used to message each other a lot, nothing flirtatious, just regular conversations. I usually hate texting, but I would reply within 30 minutes. I told her that too.

I used to check in on her through text if she wasn't feeling well. I even ordered her chocolates through zepto once when she was unwell.

A few months back, she started acting cold and distant, so I asked her if everything was okay. She said everything was fine. I asked again, and she smiled and said she was really fine. But in the back of my mind, I really wanted to hug her. Since she’s my colleague, I just told her to let me know if there’s anything she wanted to talk about.

But she was normal with everyone, except me. I'm not sure why. So I backed off, thinking it was best to let things settle.

Once, I went out with her friends during Navratri, and I was the only one she ignored. I’m definitely sure she didn’t have romantic feelings for anyone there.

Around that time, I messaged her once and she ghosted me. After two months, I got frustrated and became distant too. I was just done, but then she started initiating conversations again.

There were quite a few moments like that, where things felt cold and distant, but every time, she was the one who casually initiated conversation again.

She even brought prasad just for me in the office during the puja at her hometown.

Meanwhile, she would still bring food or call me for lunch when she made something I liked.

Once, during lunch with her team lead, I asked what she was doing on the weekend. She said she was finally going to read a book she'd been planning to read for a long time. I mentioned that I was thinking of going to a bookstore café I knew she hadn’t been to (we’d talked about it before) and asked if she wanted to go together. She said she’d be reading and would let me know.

One time, I cooked dessert myself and brought it for her (there have been several times I’ve cooked for her). But this time, I told her directly that I brought a tiffin for her and kept it in the office fridge. I told her to make sure to eat it. I’m not sure if she listened, but she looked at me when I said it.

The tiffin stayed in the fridge for two days. I was really disappointed and became distant afterward. On the third day, she finally had the dessert and told me it was really good. And when she told that she forgot., I just told that, 'I was thinking that, it would have been better if she would have forgotten.' while smiling at her. Yea, I should not have done that, I know.

Recently, I found out that even though I’m good at my work, I somehow have a reputation for being a f\*\*kboy and a womanizer, both in and outside the office. I have no idea where this came from. I don’t even use Instagram. I’ve never been on a date with any girl, let alone been in a relationship. I’m an introvert, and I only have a small group of friends I truly trust.

If it was just about me, I wouldn’t have cared. But she’s there too, and I don’t want her to get the wrong impression.

In my entire life, she’s the only girl I’ve talked to this much.

I found out about this reputation from two of my office friends, who heard it from four women at the office. I also asked another colleague, who is married—I call her sister and she confirmed it. She told me that everyone in the office seems to think that way.

I’ve never flirted with anyone. I’ve never even messaged anyone personally. After hearing all this, I stopped talking to women in the office unless they initiated the conversation or it was strictly about work. Nothing more.

This time during Navratri, I went with her again. And still, I wasn’t the one she was looking out for. She introduced me to one of her female friends as a colleague. I introduced myself too to her friend. Her friend gave her a look and smiled, I didn’t see her reaction, but I don’t know what to make of it.

I don’t know whether she has a boyfriend. From all her male and female friends I’ve met most of whom are from her hometown, college, or mutual circles, I don’t think she has romantic feelings for any of the male friends.

The thing is, she talks with everyone. She opens up even to new colleagues and asks them lots of questions.

But when she talks to me, she keeps her guard up. It becomes difficult to have a proper conversation after a while. I’ve never had this much difficulty talking to someone.

She also notices when I’m not in the office for a few days and asks where I was. Like she notices.

But the truth is, I don’t know what she’s thinking. And that’s been eating me up.

She becomes cold and distant, and then she’s the one who starts conversations again when I pull away.

I haven’t confessed my feelings to her because I still don’t understand what she’s thinking. If I had even a few signs, I would have.

These are the thoughts I’m struggling with:

* If she has a boyfriend:
   * If she likes me or doesn’t like me, it’s good that she’s keeping her distance. Why still call me for lunch or initiate conversations?
* If she doesn’t have a boyfriend:
   * If she does not like me:
      * Why still call me for lunch or initiate conversations?
   * If she does like me:
      * Then why is she making it this hard!

Tldr,

I really like this girl at work. We used to be pretty close, she’d share food, message me often, and even invite me over. But then she suddenly became distant, though she still randomly checks in or starts conversations when I pull away. Recently, I found out people at work think I’m some kind of f\*\*boy, which isn’t true at all, and I’m scared she might believe it. I haven’t told her how I feel because her mixed signals are really confusing, and I just don’t know where I stand with her anymore.",Effective_Ask_2321,Mixed signals,High
t3_1nngdza,Why must I be a 'psycho magnet'?,"I am in my 30's and I like to think that i am good with women. I am successful at dating in shorter term and often good looking women. My therapist even called me i remind him of Casa Nova.

At the end of the day what I want is a good woman to marry and build a family with. I was married for 3 years to a bipolar woman and dated maybe 4 women with borderline personality disorder, maybe 15 women in total so far in different lengths.

I'm currently being pursued heavily by a friend who is a former runway model and gymnast and I just see her as a sister figure, i am on dating apps and talking to 7 women and even before i meet them i kind of ask them to do an attachment style quiz and last woman i felt connecting with just told me she is a fearful avoidant. This is kind of a redflag for me because fearful avoidant is a high risk indication of underlying bpd or alike, emotional volatility.

Why do I keep attracting unstable women?! I have a PhD in physics, somewhat famous in my field, make 6 figures in high tech industry, I am a gym rat and I am a veteran as an infantry soldier. All I want is peace and a loving woman who I can build a future with...

t3_1nrhuym,My first date in five years,"I’m going on a first date next Saturday.. (wlw) and I really like this girl. I met her on a dating app, it was never explicitly said to be a date but I feel like it’s implied.. she’s just not very interactive like I am. We’ve been taking for a couple weeks maybe less. I ask her a lot because I genuinely care to know, she doesn’t ask me much. Maybe 5 questions when I’ve definitely asked at least 20. She does keep the convo going if either us leave each other on read or just like a message. Just super casual and at her own pace though. She has mentioned being autistic so I think it could be that. Her love language is also info dumping which is what a lot of our conversations have been so far, her info dumping and me eagerly listening but also waiting for her to show interest in me lol. Idk.. I recently got out of a codependent and abusive relationship. Maybe this is normal? I’m so scared that I’m being too much and that she doesn’t like me like I like her (even though she swiped on me first🥲) I’ve also never dated without being friends first before so that isn’t helping

t3_1nncf6w,"I need advice, my “ex” wants to get back in a few years, but I’m with a new guy.","Ok, so basically, before all this he wanted a break from “stressing to much” that’s ok, and we got back together but then my ex (19m let’s call him H) so H broke up with me to “focus on his family and his job” (he wants to be a professional soccer player), now normally I would be fine with this,that’s a valid reason to need space or break up, but the thing is he got another girlfriend (18F lets call her K). I’m happy for them and stuff but I’m so confused, cause he keeps texting me/calling me and asking “can we still get back together in a few years”, but he is with someone else. I feel like it isn’t fair to her that he wants to get back with someone else in a few years, you know? So me and my guy friend (18M let’s call him D) so D asked me out after he found out H left me again, (the first time H left me, I started liking D) so I said yes, and we’ve been dating, and H said he isn’t comfortable with that and “whatever makes you happy ig”I don’t think he should be uncomfortable with us when I am happy for him and his new girlfriend. Also I don’t feel like it’s fair to either of our new partners, for us to plan to get back together, and honestly I like being with D a lot. Is it’s normal for me to not want to get back with him I feel like he is just dragging me along. D Treats me so much better, I love him. So I feel like I shouldn’t “agree” to get back with him, when I like being with my new boyfriend, as well I don’t thinks it’s fair to D or K for us to say that. But I feel like he should know this, and I shouldn’t have to be the “adult” one is this situation. Advice? How do I bring it up? I know I want to tell H this but I’m not sure exactly how.

t3_1nng4xg,Messy Situationship,"So, I (24F) was in a long distance relationship with Oliver (30M) for six months. Oliver dumped me back on the 18th of August, which also had been our six month anniversary. He told me he couldn’t handle long distance anymore, which there was more to it than that, but he told me to go be with someone physically. He really hurt me, I trusted him, and was even willing to move to him. I took his words a little too seriously, I was in a lot of pain, and maybe spiteful. I don’t know what was going through my head, but two days after Oliver had dumped me, I went and hung out with a friend, Kaleb (23M) and wound up underneath him. Now Kaleb and I have been messing around on and off since. To the point where I started to like him, he’s a good guy and everything. There are red flags though, and I’ve dealt with enough trauma and abuse that I don’t know if I’m projecting something else onto the situation, reading too much into it. But there’s been a few talks about a relationship title, and I’m the one that brought it up first. If I’m being honest I’m not fully healed from my last relationship, obviously, I never had time to fully process everything. Also to add, Kaleb is not my type at all, Kaleb is a country boy, and he’s physically not my type. And he’s been trying to get a job and had been couch hopping, so he’s not stable either.. Which concerns me a lot more than I realize. But there’s red flags are bothering me, which I have spoken up about, but still not quite sure. So, first red flag is, he’s territorial/protective/jealous. He’s already made remarks and questions. We’re normally on the phone quite a bit, and blah blah blah. Which I understand, I could be more attentive. But at the same time I’ve been depressed lately, and this is how I choose to unwind a bit. Now, second red flag is, he startled me the one day by blowing into my face, most random thing ever. But he freaked me out and I flinched and almost hit him in response. And I apologized and also warned him that if he scares me I might accidentally hit him, and he said if I do that he would hit me back. Which I did specifically bring this up to him, which he then said he would never hit me. But I don’t know if I fully believe that, because I’ve heard that before, I’ve been abused before. Why say it then change your mind? Just confused me. The third red flag is, he’s tried to gaslight me a few times about small silly little things, but even as a joke why do it? Like he was so good at it that I almost fell for it, and it concerns me that he will do it at serious times or just be controlling with it. And the fourth red flag is a little more personal, but I’m going to bring it up. So during an intimate moment, he was making the “joke” of cumin inside me. Right, he pretty much said “don’t think I won’t” and things like that. And he did it. And I got scared as anyone else would, and he said he’s never gotten anyone pregnant before, but still. That’s not the point. I’m not pregnant thankfully. But it did make me upset for awhile there that he even did that, obviously. I’m not sure if I’m overlooking some serious things or if I’m projecting trauma onto Kaleb. And I do really like him, as much as it feels wrong at the same time. And maybe the argument we had about the territorial/protective/jealous, maybe that’s getting to me. We did have an argument about creating conversations too, because I have been unwinding and not really speaking much over the phone, and that has gotten to him a lot. Which I try, but I do feel like I’m always trying to start a conversation, why can’t he? Am I feeling guilty for nothing? Like why do I feel so badly for this? And should I run away before things get too serious? ",SkittlHipzee,Emotional pressure,High

t3_1njny22,How to make female friends when you don't have any in your social circle,"I couldn't find any post i could relate to. so i am posting this..

It basically is in the title but here is some more background information.  
I grew up very very very insecure and had very low self esteem and no confidence for years. I considered myself an introvert because I always kept a small social circle+liked being by myself (more by fear than choice) and with other nerdy kids that didn't seem like a threat. (like they wouldn't reject me, make fun of me and i was safe from other when alone)

(around high school) Got tired of my situation and figured i needed+wanted to change. So I did. I was for a few years in that ""self improvement"" space where I did the stuff that everyone recommended, the gym, improve how you look etc. I am not going to lie but for a period of my life this was helpful. I finally had a reason for a tomorrow and was excited to get better and see my life improve. So by external means I was doing good: worked hard in my studies and ended up top of class (now working as an apprentice in a good company), very fit, i'd say decent looking, and the basics of that online space.

After some time i realize that ok i was doing good externally but still inside i wasn't sure of who i was so i quit that space. I kept the good habits but decided to become myself... Learn what i liked and actually be human (idk that phrase makes sense as of: ""I am not a good empty shell anymore""). But have a personality, have actual passions and interests, like myself... And good news, I did it.  
The past few months and years, I've found myself more, got more stable emotionally, developed real passions, got more social, developed deeper friendships, better social skills, more confidence in myself, going out more, etc...

The only problem I currently face is that years of ""isolation"" and just staying with the same few friends gave me no relationship experience whatsoever...

I kinda need help figuring that out. I never had female friends (felt too insecure as i explained. I get it was ridiculous and i was putting women on a pedestal back then). I don't have women in my social circle...  
I ""tried"" dating apps but only got tired of it because.. ok i get matches and likes (compared to my friends i get more --&gt; outside appearance like i said) but convo that get nowhere, no response and all. It feels like a waste of time.

So even though my life got better and still gets better, i realize that this is a problem but I don't know how to fix it... Not only as for dating but also just to have more friends. I don't really care too much abt dating. I am ok going with the flow and doing that later. I feel like for me this is just about having a normal life and having+beeing a good friend and actually being myself (not 100% introvert as I said. More like 50/50). But i don't want to always be with dudes xD",Ok-Wheel-9738,Alcohol/substances,High
t3_1ni42p6,Repeated Rejection,"Im in my early 30s &amp; never really had a real relationship. In 2015 i had a boyfriend for 3 months and was then dumped via text. Since then I’ve been single only plagued with situation-ships and rejection. Ive gone on dates with guys and have thought they ended well only to never see or hear from the guy again. Im met with excuses that they’re busy or not looking for a relationship only to turn up in a relationship with a girl who is not me. This hurts my self esteem and makes me feel so disposable. I still do live at home so partly i think its best im alone but im human &amp; would like someone to spend time with. Im told im pretty and interesting but when you’ve been met with rejection for a decade now i truly dont think anyone is out there for me. I’ve tried dating apps, speed dating, and just meeting guys out. Whenever i meet a new guy i think maybe this time it’ll work out but then it doesnt and i get just so discouraged. Sometimes i pray that if it isn’t meant for me for the desire to go away Im tired of being told its not me and rejection isnt always about me but different circumstances. I question whats wrong with me for me to have been single since 2015. Its not fair nor normal to me. Im deeply hurting and don’t know what to do to heal myself I get anxious and sad to a point i truly believe im going to be single forever.

t3_1nh994q,Am i overthinking (please help me),"I’m gonna start this by apologizing for I am not a great story teller so if this seems to be all over the place, my bad. But I’ve (19M) started seeing this girl(20F) recently and originally we hit off great. We would hang out all the time, we had a GREAT connection, we would chat all the time. It felt like we were doing really good. But recently things just feel off. We met through a mutual friend and right off the gate we seemed to have a good connection. We went on a couple “double dates” where I was just starting to get to know her but eventually she asked me if I wanted to hangout just the two of us. And we did and we had a great time. And soon we started hanging out together a ton. I even slept over the one night (in her bed but there was still good distance between us, which I was fine with because I like taking things slow) and this was only like 7 days into knowing her. So I thought things were going really well. We kept hanging out and I even slept over more and more. Soon we kissed and made out for the first time. And this was like a week after the first sleepover. And this was not normal for me because I take things slow but apparently not her because these were all her ideas. And not soon after we did end up having sex. Which again I was not even thinking about at this time and I was so astonished when she brought up the idea. We had sex again not that long after we kissed for the first time. And I thought things were going great. But this is where things started to decline. Now granted we met at the end of summer and when we were hanging out it was when we had no other I guess responsibilities if that’s the right word to use. But for that week before we had sex I was in school and she was coming over almost everyday. And days she wasn’t coming over I was going to her house and even sleeping over. But the next week after the sex things started to feel just so weird. She seemed to text me less and snap me less. And we only met up a few times. We did call some nights tho so again I thought things were fine. Then I really fucked up. I ended up saying something to someone I shouldn’t have about the girl, this caused a huge issue that ended up with things being weird with her and her friends. Yes I admit it I did a stupid thing and she even told me that she was mad at me that she couldn’t believe that I would do something like that. And this is where I just thought it was gonna be over. But no we seemed to work it out, but ever since then we barely hang out. We did a few times but no where close to before. This was also when her classes started so she was extra busy during the day but still it had been hard to see her at all. This happened just last week and as of 2 days ago I’ve only known her for a month so the rapidness of things being so good and then so (as how I feel) bad is fucking killing me. Because I tend to overthink everything in a relationship and I can’t tell if she even likes me or not because the last time we kissed was the last time we fucked (which the time between our last kiss and the time between us meeting to fucking is almost the same) and it’s killing me. She told me that she always speaks her mind and doesn’t let things sit. Like she always tells it how it is, especially with a partner. So that’s why I have this good feeling that things are good but she also told me that in the past after she’s had sex with someone she’s been weird with them after. And that scares the fuck out of me because I don’t want that to be me. I’m scared to say anything because I don’t want her to get mad because on multiple occasions she’s said about how she tells it how it is. So I don’t want her to think that I’m insecure (even tho I totally am). I’m just scared. I’ve only ever been in one relationship where I was definitely emotionally abused so Idk if I’m seeing things that aren’t there or what. I’m just scared because I really like this girl and idk what to do. Can someone please help me and just give suggestions of what to do. Any kind of clarifications I am happy to provide. Thank you.

t3_1ngu687,I'm (M25)spiraling. Did I fumble her (F21)?,"OK, where to start. There's this girl from work. She's...amazing. we've been talking for like 3 weeks now. Just talking, because she recently left a very toxic situation. That's neither here nor there, here's the problem. This is gonna be so all over the place. Apologies in advance. 

She recently had a girl's weekend. As a result her phone was on DND. My issue was, I didn't know this so when I sent her a text (Saturday morning) that she wasn't replying to after like 10 hrs, I felt a way about it a little bit. So today (Sunday, around midday) I send her a text. Basically I let her know that I appreciate consistent communication and I get that she's not a big texter and I ask her if there's a way we can meet in the middle. Now normally, I'd be cool with this, however, this came 2 days after she was venting to me about how much she hates when guys feel entitled to her time, especially when there's no real relationship (us). When she finally responded, I noticed a massive energy shift. Short replies and such. She even switched off her read receipts, so now I don't know when she's online. I'm worried she's lumped me in with the guys she was telling me about. I genuinely don't want to control, nor feel entitled to her time. I just know that some level of communication is a must for me in a relationship and was wondering if me and her, could reach a happy middle. At the same time though it's like ... am I like those guys? Am I trying to suffocate her? Did I not respect her space? Idk. So the question is, did I fumble her? Am I the guy she was telling me about? If so, is there anything I can do to fix this?

Tldr: a girl I'm talking to said she doesn't like when guys don't respect her space and I fear I may have acted in a way that could be perceived as such

t3_1nj3eeo,I (19M) think my supervisor(19F) likes me,"This all started around a month and a half ago. I was talking to one of my coworkers(M20), i’ll name him John for the sake of the story, about cameras, I work in sales and it was a slow day so I was just trying to make the day go by faster. My Supervisor comes up about half way through our conversation and is talking about how she was planning a girls trip with 2 of her other friends. One of my other coworkers(M19), i’ll call him Adam, comes up and says “that sounds like prime time for john and you to meet some single girls”. After that comment my supervisor says “well I have 2 single friends for you” while looking at John, then looks at me says “im single and boxed off” not in a flirty tone at all, just a normal tone.

For a while leading up to this me and her would joke around with eachother and she said that she liked that I could take a joke, and around that point I noticed that she usually smiles around me when she normally has a RBF.

Me and some of my other coworkers play games like CS, and rainbow 6 after work, normally high or drunk. I get shitfaced on the game on Friday’s and Saturdays and my coworkers will tell stories about how i’ll have a cam on in discord, looking stupid with my shirt off. One time specifically she said “one of these nights I want to join and see you with your shirt off taking shots” she also said that it would be funny to see how I ragebait my coworkers because of how bad I am when im drunk.

Around 2 months ago she was making our lunch schedules and normally they are scattered but for a month there were on and off schedules where we had lunch at the same time. During those we would make jokes and just talk. She always initiated conversation with me and it always felt natural.

Recently in a one on one with her I went into the office, and said “whats up” and she was immediately smiling and looking away. Then later that day she did a certification for me, it was a long day so I was blanking out and staring at her, she asked me a question and I had to have her repeat it while literally staring at her. Later in the certification she stumbled on her words and said “sorry my mind is racing at 100mph”

TL;DR

About a month and a half ago my supervisor (F19) started acting differently around me. She’s hinted at being single (even saying it directly while looking at me), smiles and laughs a lot around me despite normally having RBF, and often initiates conversations that feel natural. She scheduled her lunch to overlap with mine for a while, and recently joked about wanting to join Discord to watch me play drunk/shirtless because she thinks it’d be funny. In a one-on-one meeting she laughed and looked away just from me saying my day was “not too bad,” and during a certification she stumbled over her words, admitted her mind was racing, while I caught myself blanking out staring at her.

For the last couple of days ive been dreaming about waking up and her being in my bed with me, then waking up irl and shes not there. Im pretty positive I like her but does she like me back? Also she is way out of my league but that might just be my attraction to her.

Should I ask her out? How does her being my supervisor affect my situation? Am I stupid for not asking her out sooner?",bruh_moment_m,Mixed signals,High
t3_1nfan4g,helped my friend fix his profile after 0 matches in 3 months,"not really sure if this is helpful to anyone but figured i’d share. my homie kyle was getting absolutely *no* matches for like 3 straight months on hinge. not exaggerating. zero. and this is a guy who’s actually chill and funny in real life.
  
he showed me his profile one night and it kinda clicked. all his pics were either stiff selfies or random group shots where you couldn’t even tell who he was. the prompts were like “i like food” or “looking for someone to vibe with.” like okay cool but who *are* you, bro?

so i literally put this man on (i'm cuffed so had my gf pitch in to help too)

we started with his pics. i just told him to send me anything where he looked like himself, not trying too hard, just normal. found a couple where he was playing guitar, one hiking, one where he’s just laughing at something off camera. honestly just something chill that actually shows him looking normal. we also added some photos that we generated using photorizz.app that showed him traveling, at the beach etc, and the photography grade photos definitely helped. we realized pretty fast that it’s way easier to get ignored for being too weird than for being a little boring. Like yeah, being interesting is good, but don't be the ‘weirdo hinge guy’

we rewrote the prompts together too. i just asked him stuff i knew about him and we turned that into actual sentences. one was like a hot take about pineapple on pizza, another was just him roasting people who don’t use turn signals. felt like stuff he’d actually say out loud, which is the whole point imo.

we also added a photo with his dog. idk why but that just always works.

i told him to chill with the swiping at first, don’t go crazy liking every single profile. just let the app do its thing and slowly build some momentum.

within a few days, he started getting matches again. and like, actual conversations too. same guy, same personality.

anyway, just throwing this out there in case anyone else is struggling and thinks they’re the problem. it’s probably your profile, not you.

I got to know her pretty well, we facetimed, we agreed on a lot of things and would text all day every day.

I also was pretty open about what I was on the app for, that I want to date and maybe get something long term and she accepted it. The date itself went well we explored some attractions and ate somewhere and talked the whole time it was a nice little adventure. The whole thing was like 8 hours. I never made any advances beyond complimenting her person 2x. After I dropped her off it was like a tonal shift.

t3_1nd94m9,"Have I become an avoidant, or is it okay to feel the ick?","I have a question relating to how the frequency and speed to which someone replies to your texts, when you are in the first 2 weeks of speaking to each other, should/shouldn't be a deterrent. 

To be as unbiased as possible in your evaluation, I leave my dating history, this current situation, and my immediate response/question below. 



Background: I (F,29) have had 3 serious relationships before. I was once engaged to someone for almost 4 years between 20 and 24 years. In this relationship, my ex was consistently messaging me, but it would also quickly turn into harassment messages if we were having arguments/fights. I felt smothered and without any sense of control in my life. In my next relationship of 3 years, I was the person being told that to message once or twice a day was too much so I became aware of people who preferred to message way less. Finally my last relationship was one of unrequited love (him not being interested in me), and we decided to remain friends who message once in a while to catch up. Since getting over this heartbreak, I have met one guy for a casual hookup and we still message occassionally where he mentions he would want to hookup again.

  
Current situation: Met this guy on Tindr, on the Long-Term Relationship side of the app (as I felt ready to move away from the idea of random hookups). We started chatting and at first, it was very rapid back and forth which I felt was normal considering you are trying to quickly get to know someone before then you say ""let's go on a date"" and then you will know more. Within two days of speaking, he said why don't we go for a coffee (I liked the forwardness, not beating around the bush) so I agreed. We ended up having dinner and conversation went on for hours (I also take 2 hours to eat a meal, no joke). He is a very respectful person, showed interest, is a massive Star Wars fan (I am not familiar but happy to learn). 

  
Question: Where my issue lies in that this guys messages me so many times throughtout the day. Even when i haven't responded back for 2 hours, he sometimes send me another one asking how everything is going. But when I do respond, he will message within 20 minutes guarantee. And I feel suffocated. I am someone who is super independent in my day-to-day activities, and have many friends/family that i will catch up with each day. So if I am not going to a specific gym class, I am at an art course, or meeting a friend etc. I have learned how to be more protective over my time because I do feel it is our most valuable resource. I am not someone to message back straight away until I feel I can enjoy messaging someone, and I also tend to expect that from the person I am seeing. I LIKE to see someone being busy doing their own thing, and then to catch up in the evening over a quick audio or slightly longer message instead. It makes me feel they are prioritising their own activities still, and not dropping everything for me. Also feels like I am not under threat by being controlled by a person who has nothing else to do with their time (my first ex). My question is is it unfair for me to be judging someone for messaging so quickly, or have i unintentionally become an avoidant who flinches at the first sign of another person's interest?",Embarrassed-Wash-936,General consent ambiguity,Medium
t3_1nc3xm2,Help give him grace he needs?,"‘F32’ ‘M/44’. My significant other has been very stressed out because they’ve been trying to close one of their houses for over a year. They thought they found a buyer, but the buyer isn’t closing anymore. I can tell he’s been a little distant with me which I know is due distress. Also, he had his brother and wife come and stay with us for a week. Now his stepsister is staying with us for a week. I texted him this, “Hey I know you're busy today but I feel you've seemed a little stressed this week. I know Nikki’s in town so you want to spend time with her. Is there anything I can help with or anything I need to know? Just thinking about you.” I know this sounds silly, but what should I say? What would you like to hear from your significant other when super stressed out?  Normally, I would say something like I’m very sorry to hear that. Please let me know if there’s anything I can do for you. He always responds with. Oh it’s OK. Everything‘s fine. You do enough.

What should I say exactly in a text message to him saying I’m just stressed out about the house not closing?",Catholicnew27,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1n7yy59,Haven't heard back from guy I've been seeing for a month post-burning man,"Hi all, I'm a 28F and he's 34M.

so context is that I've been seeing this guy before he went to burning man. I've never been to burning man before, and this is his 3rd or 4th time I believe. I think we had a genuine connection and we both made it pretty clear we like each other. He mentioned he'd be difficult to reach until Sunday, since there is no internet etc on the playa.

However, it's already almost Thursday and I haven't heard a single thing from him.

Hearing you all talk about Burning Man, it seems like there is a lot of.... temptation, if you will.

At this point, I'm just assuming he met someone there or had some revelation that I'm not for him. Another part of me is worried maybe he got into an accident or something happened to him. And the avoidant side of me is starting to emotionally prepare for the worst, and distance myself from him. I'm just mentally prepared that I'll never talk to him again from there.

But the hopeful side of me wishes to hear that this is normal.

How long does it take for you to ""re-integrate"", or text a love interest that you are safe back? It seems lackadaisical and negligent to not send a single ""I'm back how are you I missed you"" text after Burning man.

Just want to hear your two cents. Thank you.

t3_1myn3l0,Normal Response Time on Apps,"Hey guys sorry but this post is gonna be a bit chaotic cuz it's late and I have a lot of questions. 

So I 28 (F) have recently started trying online dating fir the first time and to be honest I'm not quite sure the best way to figure out if someone is actually interested.

In regards to response time, is getting a response from someone a couple of times in the evening once a day normal or socially acceptable? I'm gonna be honest, personally I don't mind it, I'm pretty introverted and doing my own thing a lot but at the same time I don't want to waste my social battery staying in communication with someone who's not actually interested. I've ghosted a few guys already who only responded after several days had passed and it was clear they weren't actually interested or just didn't care. But I've had a few people who consistently messaged at least once a day and wasn't sure if that meant no interest and I should just move on. Can someone give me any advice or insight?

t3_1mxdrjs,How should I ask out this girl that works at a local book store?,"Hey, I (21M) went to my local book store yesterday to ask about a comic I want to buy, and the person I talked to was this cute girl about my age. We talked for a bit, she told me what options I have for the comic, and we also joked around a bit.  
I feel like we kinda hit it off and I was wondering how I should approach her/ask her out maybe?  
I know, there is a high chance that she was just being nice because she works there, but I still wanna take my chance, even if I'm going to get rejected.  
I went back there today and bought a book (To kill a mockingbird, heard a lot about it so why not) and she greeted me with this big smile and asked me about that comic from yesterday and if I ordered it online (since they weren't able to get the one I wanted in store).

Idk I'm thinking of going back there again in a few days and hoping that there will be an opportunity to just talk to her for a second and maybe ask for her number/give her mine (what would be the better move here??). If not, another idea I had was going there once a week and buying a new romance book every time until she maybe gets the idea/strikes a conversation about them, which then could lead to me asking her out?  
(This wouldn't be a money waste imo since I do wanna start reading more and I like romances, and also maybe it's a bit romantic? You tell me)

Idk maybe this is all insanely pathetic, I'm normally very shy and socially anxious so this feels very out of character for me, but I want to give it a shot this time.

Im a 24 F and my brother is a 22 M he's 6'1 has a full beard and is an electrician so he makes really good money for his age. On top of that he really is a very conventionally attractive guy. He's super sweet and a huge nerd for video games, manga, anime and is an avid DnD player. Hes very affectionate with family and friends always the first to start a hug or the family cuddle puddle. Yet he is also more on the awkward side and is on the spectrum. He doesn't do the best in loud crowded spaces and will normally always slip off to play on his phone to ground himself. For 2 years now he has tried every dating app available and has made it no where with anyone he meets. I mean he hasn't even had his first kiss yet. It breaks my heart when he comes to me and ask what he's doing wrong and that he's lonely and just wants someone to spend time with and love. Iv always just had relationships just fall in my lap and never really had to try so hard to find someone. If anyone has any advice for an older sister just trying to help her brother please share.

t3_1mp02pk,Am I in the wrong? Need a second opinion.. or two,"Context: I’m 19 and in college; involved in Greek life, but it’s not my personality AT ALL; this is my first time using Reddit so I’m sorry if anything’s weird. Also this is kinda long so sorry ahead of time

The story starts a couple of days ago when she said she was going to come into town to visit her friends (G &amp; H; in the same sorority as her), then hang out with me. Cool, no problem whatsoever. She recently transferred to a community college ab an hour away to save money and plans on coming back after a semester or two. 

Fast forward to yesterday and I wasn’t particularly having a good day. And on top of that I had work my whole afternoon.

Her friend H (who can’t hold a man if her life depended on it) wanted to go to a mixer at a fraternity. (A mixer is basically a social event where a frat invites over a particular sorority as a way to meet and mingle). Cool, slightly bummed out but overall I trust her. I’m in another fraternity and I don’t really have an issue with that particular fraternity.

She also told me that she would see me around 9:30. Kinda killed my mood bc I was expecting to see her sooner, like when I got off work, but o well I’m not gonna tell her what to do.

I got off of work and called her wanting to pick her up and get something to eat. No answer which wasn’t normal. Got a text “at the ___ house” (enter sorority) and texted back saying I wanted to pick her up and grab something to eat. 

“I’m with my friend”. This wasn’t G or H, and to be honest, I’m not really sure who it is. She would’ve said “I’m with H/G” but from what I’m guessing it’s probably a new girl that just joined her sorority.

I replied “Ok nvm”, and got “I’m sorry”. More bummed out, bc I wanted to see her sooner. 

30 mins go by and she asked if I was upset, then if I’d be upset if she went to ___ (enter fraternity). I said “yeah”. It was right next door to the mixer. She has history with a few of the guys at that fraternity and I’ve told her before that I am very uncomfortable with her going there. 

She said “can you talk to me”. Truthfully, I didn’t want to chat at all. I would never ask to go somewhere where my girlfriend was uncomfortable with me going, and I kinda expected the same. 

Told her I was “upset but didn’t want her to feel bad”. She asked “why are you upset” and I told her we could talk about it when she got home. 

The texting ended with me saying lmk when she got to my house so I could let her in and her saying “I love you more then you know” and “I’m so sorry I made you upset” then lovebombing me with heart and kiss emojis. It didn’t really make her apology feel real bc she doesn’t normally lovebomb. Made it feel like it was more of a “this is what he would want to see in this moment” feeling. 

She got to my house around 9, and the first thing we did was sit next to each other and talk. I had a few points that I’ll list below if I can remember them.

-going to frat that she knew I was very uncomfortable with
-her single friends taking her out to the mixer
-her not doing the same effort for me as I did for her (whenever she had gotten upset with me, I stopped everything and would call her until she felt better; nothing like that happened)
-I set my expectations too high; I.e. I thought we would go eat something, and I would’ve seen her sooner (more of a personal issue than anything on her part, and I admitted that and took full responsibility)

As for her and her friends going to the mixer, she said “that that’s what her friends wanted to do”. I tried to say that that’s a setting for single people, and I wasn’t sure if her single friend’s influence is a good look. 

As someone in a frat, I know how frat guys act, and by putting yourself in that setting it doesn’t sit well with me. Told her how I’ve been cheated on before and she put herself in a setting where cheating is much more likely. (I’ve been working on myself because I think being cheated on caused insecurities; I have definitely made progress tho)

She raised her voice and said something along the lines of “well you want me to just not be friends with them”. I was like “no not at all”. I know her friends mean a lot to her, it’s just I don’t think that she would be comfortable if me and my friends went to a sorority party where the main purpose was to mingle. (Those don’t exist but for the sake of my point just imagine)

Going to the frat that I’m uncomfortable with. I asked if she knew or thought I was upset over our texts, she said yeah. Then I asked why she still went over to the frat I’m uncomfortable with. She raised her voice again “so you want me to just leave my friends when they want to go there… when I go out with my friends it’s not about what would ____ (me) want… it doesn’t revolve around you…”

I said that I didn’t intend to control her and I didn’t control her, but a bit of consideration would be nice. Like “if I think he’s upset, and I want him to feel better, maybe I shouldn’t go to the one place that he is super super uncomfortable with me going to”. But I guess that thought didn’t come through. 

Somehow I ended up apologizing for both her going to the mixer, and her going to the frat I’m uncomfortable with. Something like how I was sorry for not being considerate of her time with her friends or something 

When I brought up her not putting in the same effort to make me feel better, she had no choice but to apologize. There really wasn’t any wiggle room for an explanation. She simply said “I’m sorry and you’re right, I should’ve done more”. 

We both apologized for making each other upset and then that was it. Handled like adults, sorta. I don’t think that my points were really heard and taken to heart. There was no “I’m going to try better to avoid the fraternity you don’t like”. It was more of a “I’m sorry that you feel that way but I’m not gonna compromise if that’s what my friends wanna do”, or at least that’s how it felt to me. 

I tried to remember the exact things said, but it’s 4 am and this all happened at like 9:30 last night.. so it might not be exactly what happened

These arguments aren’t big, or frequent, I think this is like the second one in ab 5-6 months and it wasn’t like we were screaming at each other, only raised voices on her end. She is wonderful and I really love her. I guess my question would be am I valid for being upset, or is it just my insecurities that I need to get over that are causing problems, or both? 

Sorry for this being a long post. I’ve never done this before, but I often try to find similar situations to me online to see if I’m not just overthinking things. Thanks to all who read and give an answer ",[deleted],Alcohol/substances,High
t3_1mtwzx6,Anyone else have that weird phobia of shooting your shot and asking a woman out but they turn out to be way younger/older than you thought?,"I (33M) am trying to get better at shooting my shot and asking women out in a public setting but I am scared that when I ask them out they are actually 21 or something.

How do you even ask that without sounding weird? Probably best not to ask that but I guess you'll eventually find out I guess right? Should I just ask upfront if she is in a relationship?

t3_1mukt1v,How can i move on from this guy?,"I [22F] like this guy [25m] from our church since 2017. He was my light group head back then. Fell for him because, for some reason, he just knows the right things to say. he became an image of god for me here on earth.

I started going to our youth gathering in January 2017. However, i was only active for around 3 months. our youth group had a camp back then that i cannot attend because we had no money for it. with that, i just felt shy going back to the group after since i thought i'd be left out. but afterwards, i was still attending maybe once a month or once every 2 months. pandemic happened, and i entered college already, so i wasnt able to attend at all for several years. but i'd still go to our church every week, but not the youth gathering.

i've been meaning to go, not because of him (okay maybe partly), but since i know that it is one of the reasons why i built a stronger connection with god.

fast forward to my 4th year in college (around november 2024), he suddenly started interacting with my ig stories and posts. he would reply or like them. there were several days he would message daily. he then invited me to a coffee pop up by his friend. i came, of course, but was there for only a few minutes because i had to meet my friends afterwards. and frankly because my body was shaking badly because hey that's my crush! and for some reason, after that day, the messages and interactions significantly lessened. i am honestly not sure what ive done, but it's fine for me. we would still interact with one another now and then but very limited.

fast forward to few months after (april 2025), there was another youth camp! this year, i really told myself that i should go already. i'm already 22 and is about to graduate college so i had to go to that camp. not because of him, but because i know i would get to know god deeper there. i'm scared that if i did not attend this year, i may not be eligible anymore in the coming years because im technically not a youth anymore lol. before signing up, i messaged him to ask if there were also first time camp attendees that are already in their 20s just like me. he validated me that yes there are, so that gave me the confidence to sign up. mind you, prior to this, we would still send each other random reels very seldom tho. he also invited me to go to the monthly coffee pop up by his friend too.

came camp, i had the best days of my life. on the last day, i came up to him to hug and tell him, ""thank you for not being a stranger all these years. let's push through with that coffee please"" he said sure.

it has been months, and for some reason, he never sent any reel anymore and would often ignore mine. which btw was fine with me, i was never entitled to any response i know!! and i don't really want to be a burden.

almost end of july 2025, i saw in his ig note he wrote, ""should i ask her out?"" which may just confirm that he already has a special someone. don't get me wrong, i am very happy for him. i aspire nothing but his happiness. i just brushed it off. few days later, while casually scrolling through ig reels, i saw a post by a girl where she and him went out. hehe maybe she was the girl he was referring to in his ig note. upon further investigation, i learned that they were childhood friends. i also get why he may develop feelings for the girl— basing on her posts, she is very matured, intelligent, kind, god-fearing, and very pretty.

last sunday, i served in church taking pictures. he was there too. i greeted him happily and asked how he was. every thing should be normal. he is completely unaware of my feelings, and he is not responsible with me in any way. so i should really act casual. i was packing my things when he came to me, we had a short conversation. he even offered a ride to the cafe where the youth group would be hanging out after service, which i gladly agreed to. in the cafe, he sat next to me and we (along with other youth) had conversations and games. it was definitely fun. i accidentally glanced on his phone one time and saw that he was sending a photo to someone. i did not saw who it really was but saw that the icon was mostly white. when we got home, i saw that the icon kinda resembles the icon of the girl that posted the reel. this just confirmed to me more that they may be dating or talking already.

i know i do not have any right in this situation. i'm just a girl who has been secretly liking him lol. my friends told me several times already to confess my feelings for him. but i know for a fact that if that feelings are reciprocated, he would have told me already. but no, so i can confirm that this is all just me lol. and that's fine, i just have to find a way to move on already. god it has been more than 8 years ready. please don't get me wrong, i am truly happy for him if he ends up with the girl. they deserve each other, and actually they look like a perfect match.

i just need to ask for advice on how i should move on. i think this is harder that moving on from a relationship, because i know that there was nothing to begin with lol. at least when you end a relationship, you both know that you have to stay away from each other and that you tried yet things just doesn't work out. i just can't find a handbook that tells me ways on how i should move on from a guy in this situation lol. knowing for a fact that i would see him every week in church (non nego btw, i love my church and would not replace it just to move on from a guy haha)",ijustwantstability,General consent ambiguity,Medium

t3_1mczlrl,Pursuing my close friend?,"Met her in 2015, roughly sophomore year of hs (same age). We were 15M 15F. Our moms were child hood friends. She lived 1-2hrs away from me so we only see each other at family-friend gatherings. We grew close in hs but she moved out for college. Didn’t miss a beat every time we would see eachother in school breaks but drifted apart a normal amount. Always escape the family function to goof off, smoke, drink, have fun. Would always talk about our current relationships and how the people we would see never really fit. Not sure if it’s important but she’s definitely been with/seen more people than me. Would discuss her regretful “phase” as many do. She’s the flirty type. I’ve always been next to her through tough or complex times and try to do my best to treat her with care as I feel she deserves but never go overboard. After college she moved on to higher education that started last year in another country but during that time her parents moved much closer to me. Still hang out during breaks n all and feels like we saw each other the day before after months apart. And now get to see her more often. I got out of 3 year relationship just before she came back into town. She had a thing w someone where she goes to school but that recently fell apart. Over the 4th of July this year she said things like “you should come over and cook for me” and invites me over when she has the house to herself. I’ve known her for over 10 years now and have gone through every emotion and thought about how I feel about her over that time. I’ve always had a deep interest but have done my absolute best to keep it in. Every time the thought of pursuing comes up I try my best to reason with myself about the risks to our friendship and all the other baggage that comes with that kind of failure. I try to tell myself the only reasonable thing to do if I have the goal of pursuing her is to just be the best person I can be and hold off any attempt until she is back home for good. And even then, not to take the chance unless I have legitimate confidence that I’m not the only interested party. Unfortunately this long game fantasy of mine nearly crumbles every time she’s back in town. I hate to see and hear about the shitty waste of time guys she dates when she deserves and can do far better. She always comes to me for guidance and advice when she needs. We get alone pretty well and understand each other’s personalities. I try to tell myself there’s no sense in “making a move” or confessing any romantic interest when she still has a few years abroad. I’ve been waiting and keep telling myself to keep waiting but it’s only gotten harder over the years. As the thought loops continue, I keep thinking about if I did consider doing anything, what would I even do? Make a move? Try to explain my position? Drop hints? Every scenario I could think of ends in embarrassment. I’ve gotten close many times but always pulled back to save her the trouble. I’m really at wits end. Any advice helps.

Now we have had 4 dates in the last 2 weeks. Intimate 1 night. No penetrative sex though. As I don't do that outside if exclusivity. 

My issue is I kinda want to keep dating, and seeing what is about.thetes one woman I have been talking to for a couple weeks, that I'm quite excited to see on a date, and who I feel way more attracted too.  

Do I need to tell woman one that I want/plan to keep dating, until we becone exclusive.

For me being exclusive is essentially bf/gf and I really see a future with them. Snd I'm not ready to make that call with the woman I've had 4 dates with.

But something feels off, it feels kinda playerish and I dont really like the idea. Unless what I'm doing us being clearly communicated.

t3_1m8kjv9,I have a question,"Dating as a man is not about your ""character"" or the cheesy lines some pua gave you. It's about your car, your clothes, your watch, your house, and other resources. Of course, good looks help, especially when combined with a brand new car. This is completely normal and actually a well-known fact.

So why does everyone keep talking nonsense — push-pull seduction, mysterious strategies that never work, and how all men struggle and get rejected 99.5 times out of 100 approaches depsite all theg years spent studying ""game""? Maybe they’re just not rich enough. Or maybe, no man is ever ""worthy"" enough — haha.

So here’s my dating advice: look after your health and your finances. Follow your own path. Don’t let capitalism convince you that you’re a failure just because you don’t have the resources to be “loved” or “liked” or whatever they call it.

Or, if you prefer, go ahead and start working hard at a 9–5 like a caged animal. Make money. And while you’re struggling to open your eyes each morning, some girl will “fall in love” with you! Of course she will — she finally found the man who takes responsibility, works hard, is caring, leases a brand-new Mercedes, and checks all the boxes.

Everything is going great. You finally made it.

Except… one day, after the capitalist machine has chewed you up and used you to the max, your health is gone but atleast you are/were truly ""loved"".

t3_1m5zem9,Interpretation of a woman approaching me at the gym,"So this one has me quite baffled.

I’ve been a regular at a gym for several years. There is an attractive woman roughly same age that overlaps schedules sometimes, so we’ve presumably seen each other in passing for several months plus but never spoken directly. I’ve noticed her as an attractive woman but I’m not there to go seek out women, literally doesn’t cross my mind there to ever approach a woman.

Anyway, last week we were both there and she approached me between sets when I had headphones on. She introduced herself by name, I gave mine, and she said something like: ‘I have a random question and it doesn’t apply to you - there’s guys here that I don’t like getting attention from/am not interested in and I’m wondering what a guys perspective is on how to show them I’m not interested. You seem like a normal guy.’

It was so out of left field to me that I was just confused and thought at first it was directed at me like you see on YouTube or something, so I double checked, and she said ‘no it doesn’t apply to you’ and her general body language confirmed that to me.

I sort of fumbled around an answer and we talked for maybe a couple minutes. I said something about let me think more and let you know and offered some basic stuff but I was pretty thrown off. She said something like to let her know and I’ll let you get back to working out. Then I double checked her name as she left and she turned, smiled, and nodded adding my name.

I asked one woman co-worker but she had no idea because she said she would never approach anyone in a gym like that. Kind of like how thrown off I was with it. Guys tend to think she’s interested, but I don’t want to be that guy here.

I figure that either:

1.	⁠she legitimately was curious for a guys perspective and recognized me as a regular and not creepy (which is a compliment itself)

or

2) there’s some interest and this was a way to open a door to continued talking albeit an odd way to do it perhaps. Hence introducing herself by name rather than just the question.

More for women but would you ever approach a man in the gym like this? What do you think from the two scenarios?

Have any guys had this happen and it be a serious platonic type scenario where you hadn’t spoken to them previously?

I guess I’m most confused because putting myself in her position I would have asked a male I already know (friend or boyfriend), another woman I know, or even ChatGPT before I would also a male I don’t know but have seen before.

I have yet to see her since, been like 4-5 days but we aren’t always on the same schedule.

hi? my boyfriend is so sweet and everyone is a big fan of him. however, i’ll shorten down my question.
is it ok for ur bf to get you to pleasure them s**ually if ur drunk and feel sick and told them ur about to be sick so had to turn around in bed but they said that by doing that it’ll make me feel better?
i didn’t say yes or no i just did it :/ even tho it made me feel worse so im at fault probs
i don’t wanna ruin the relationship if it’s not the end of the world but ive been thru sm with men as in they’ve been disrespectful to me.
idk if it’s a minimal thing and should just see if happens next time and i’ll say no and see what he does?

will the relationship be ok? am i panicking for the worst because of a SA incident a while ago

t3_1m4kez3,My new boyfriend’s drunk friends disrespect me,"I 33f started dating my 25M boyfriend a week ago. We are pretty new . Idk if we our official couple, but we both decided to be exclusive dating… anyways it’s new and Friday night was the last time I saw him. We talk all the time and he’s very sweet and caring. Last night he went on an overnight shark fishing with his six buddies , I never met them yet , I heard his best friend over the phone once he seemed nice enough. Well late last night my boyfriend wanted to talk over the phone , I called him and we were chatting alittle and I hear in the background one of his buddies shouting kinda taunting my boyfriend about me “ fuck me in the ass…” I don’t remember much of what he said but my bf told him to shut the fuck up and he will kick his ass and his kept going . I told my bf I can just call him later or tomorrow and I hung up . He kept texting apologizing about their behavior and he said something to them and they said it was funny and it was a joke. I tried to play it down it’s whatever they’re drunk .. that he should just hangout with his boys I’ll talk to him tomorrow . He said can we talk that he’s alone. I called back and he apologized and said they aren’t normally like that. That he hopes I don’t see him differently because of them. I said we are fine. 
They kept bothering him and eventually we said goodnight and apologize again . 

I felt very disrespected by them. Especially when they didn’t show respect to him . I haven’t met them yet .. the guy did apologize on my bf phone because my bf made him . But idk if I saw them I would really want to speak to them.  Plus makes me wonder what my bf said to them about me before they started drinking to make them feel comfortable blurting something like that out.

So my question is are  men friends like that with all their buddies when they are drunk ?   Are these guys just tools and is my boyfriend this disrespectful too with his buddies?

t3_1m3ns0p,I don’t know how to date/be in a relationship anymore,"I (20M) was a very good-looking, flirty guy and had a total of two (serious) relationships but both of them did not last very long. (6 and 8 months)

To give you a short and clear background:

- My last relationship was in 2023. 
- I used to get multiple hookups and did not struggle to talk to a girl at all. In fact, everyone tells me I’m very easy to talk to.
- I moved out in that same year to Germany after my graduation and lost all my confidence and struggled a lot making friends and hanging out. I still had something going on with a girl but it wasn’t serious so I wasn’t interested anymore.
- I go back to holidays to my country for about two weeks and this is my second one right now (Tunisia)

Fast forward to 2025, I’m now a CrossFit Trainer in a box that is full of way older people (youngest after me is a 27M).
I don’t hang out with people my age anymore and I consider myself also very mature for my age. However, it is so hard to find a girl that wants to date a younger guy but that, for now, is a different story.

Now, I am still very confident and funny enough, better looking since I train seriously too.

I find this super beautiful girl in our friendgroup and she offered me to stay at her place since I lived in a different city and wanted to spend more time (one day more) getting to know each other. We spent the whole day and night together, talking, laughing, playing cards, smoking cigarettes and all that. 

I felt, however, that I was in a friendzone so I did not initiate anything. At night, we were watching something together and I offered to play with her hair. After some time, I kept being smooth in going down to her neck all the way to playing with her cheeks and mouth. Not a single word was spoken, I thought she wanted it because she kept moving her hand out of the way. Then, she woke up.. I asked if she just woke up and she said yea. She wasn’t mad at all and she took it very well because I got her to sleep with my playfulness. I confessed that I liked her and she rejected me. The rejection was super nice and she doesn’t want anything awkward. She told me that she is very unstable at this moment, (got out of a relationship, moved out of the country last year, wants to focus on herself) whether it was something serious or not since we also live far away from each other. She also gave me *hope* saying: “you never know, maybe when I’m stable enough next year, you’re the one who will reject me” I felt crushed in that moment. I have gotten many rejections before but this one hurt the most and I feel like I’m such a stupid and low confident person. I also feel like I can’t talk to girls anymore unless I already know them and I feel so weird too. 

I still like this girl now and to mention it, I knew her because close friends of our said “we look and act alike” (they’re right and I fucking love it). The interaction happened yesterday and we are meeting up again in three days. I’m leaving the country the day after it and will not see her for another year probably unless I visit her in France. 

What I ask from you is :
- Should I keep talking to her and keep it as friend and maybe hope for something  in the future ?
- What happened that changed my way of talking with girls during these two years? 
- Is it normal to feel this? I’m overwhelmed and have been single for a very long fucking while. I’m happy by myself but I also want a good experience and want to build something with another person, a partner. I don’t want to stay single for the rest of my life.

t3_1m4qipz,Is always thinking about and missing your partner something everyone experiences?,"Ok so recently my(20F) partner(21M) of one year mentioned to me that whenever he isn’t with me he is thinking about the next time we can be together/ missing me even if we are only apart for small amounts of time.

Although I love him very much, I can’t relate to these feelings and it makes me feel like a terrible person.

t3_1m2e9uf,Is this normal?,"Hello I think things are going well but I'd like some assurance/opinions as I'm new to dating. I'm 23M currently seeing 20F we met for the first time last week, a week after matching on a dating app and chatting a little on there. After the first 2 or 3 days of chatting the amount she messaged, and consequently I messaged, slowed down but that didn't stop us from meeting up and having 2 great dates, I saw her the Thursday night and we went our separate ways at 1am but were back together at 10am the next day. She went to work 5pm that day but we were together for all of it, within 2 hours we were intimate and kissing and at the end she thanked me, said she appreciated me and we kissed a bit more, even messaged while I was driving home to say she hoped I got home safely. Since then the first day after we talked a bit but it has slowed down once again like before our first date. Although she has agreed on a third date in just under a week from now (almost 2 weeks gap between the dates)

One red flag was during the date she did mention she had been talking to another guy for over a month (hadn't met yet cos he was busy) but she said she wanted to be honest with me and said it would be a shame not to explore that but didn't know when. She's still messaging me now but like I said it's slowed down, although maximum gap is just under 24 hours so is that normal?

I really like her and want to give our connection a go because I think there is potentially something there, I do believe she likes me, even if she maybe didn't expect to do so before the date. Should I be worried about this other guy or do you think her head is turned by me now considering they hadn't met in person before?

I have self worth and know what I want, but she's had toxic partners in the past and said she wanted to take things slow which is fine by me, I'm a go with the flow type of guy and am not putting any expectation or pressure on this or her because we literally only just met and it is early stages. Do you think she is seeing him as well? I don't wanna waste my time but I am an overthinker and could be reading too much into everything.

t3_1m10wa9,Should I give her a last chance?,"hey everyone, im a M18 and shes a F23. Let's call her B, and i've been close to for a long time. we’re not officially dating, but we’re super affectionate — flirty texts, virtual kisses, spicy convos, that kind of thing. we’ve talked about dating in the future, but only if she moves to my city (we live in different states).

a while ago, her ex messed her up emotionally, and she got distant and cold, and ended things with me. i said i’d only get serious again if she started therapy (which she didn’t). months passed, and now she seems more stable, saying she’s been thinking more rationally and seems in a better headspace. so we started getting close again, and i started catching real feelings again.

but here’s the thing: friday, she randomly started talking about her ex again. not just a quick mention — she was revisiting stuff emotionally. she says she’s over him, but it made me super uncomfortable, especially after everything. she knows how much that whole thing hurt me before.

then yesterday she sent a super fast voice message. i couldn’t understand it, so i asked her to repeat it. she refused. i got a bit upset (nothing mean), just kinda frustrated and worried. and she suddenly goes:
""a part of me already gave up on you.""

bro... what? over something that small? after everything i’ve been through for her?

then later she acted normal, like nothing happened. i mean, once she realised that she messed up, she feels terrible and starts to apologize. this has happened before — she gets emotional, says something hurtful, i feel terrible, and then she apologizes.

i told her this is the last chance. i’m not being mean, i just can’t keep doing this. either she respects me and changes, or i walk away.

but now i’m wondering — is this just emotional dependency? or is giving her one final shot actually fair? the worst thing is that I LOVE HER and SHE LOVES ME; so its not an easy thing

t3_1ly9par,I [18M] need help regarding a situation with my girlfriend [20F] where another guy is texting her seemingly out of nowhere.,"I (18m) have been dating my girlfriend (20f) for a few months now. We met at a study group for our calculus course in college, talked for several weeks, and then made it official. I am seeking advice about a situation that has come up recently. First, some context.

Her and I were in the same calculus course, but different sections. In her section, she was part of a group that sat together in class. This group consisted of 3 girls and 2 guys. Myself and one of the girls from the group would plan study meets for that group and some people in my section also. The guy in question for this story, we can call him John.

Classes finished in early May, and everyone went their separate ways for the summer. Fast forward two months to a few days ago, and John messaged my girlfriend on Instagram asking how her summer classes are going. I didn't think much of anything at this point. She also told me that he texted her when it happened. When I called my girlfriend that night, she told me that John wants to exchange spotify playlists with her, to which I responded ""interesting"" and ""are you going to?"" Because I wasn't really sure how to respond. When we were talking, music is one of the first things we bonded over as we made each other playlists. She said she is going to, but needs to organize her playlists first.

Fast forward to our call on the day after this, and she tells me that John is still talking to her. I asked what they were talking about, and she said that he's asking some questions to get to know her like how many sisters she has and things like that. I explained how this made me uncomfortable because music is one of the things we bonded over, and I thought it was extremely strange that after not talking for two months, he all of a sudden wants to exchange music and get to know her. Combine this with the fact that John doesn't know we are bf/gf, and it sounds like trouble. She asked me if I want her to keep being normal, or be dry with John. I told her to be normal but keep me updated. I wanted to tell her to be dry, but it seemed controlling.

I am writing this the following day. I've been thinking about the situation the entire day. What also happened today was I asked her a question that required some thought, and she said to ""give me a bit I'm out rn"" so i said okay (which she read my message). I had to wait seven hours for a response when she is just asking to call. On the call I asked what she was doing and she explained her day. She had plenty of chances to text back from what it sounded like. I told her that it would be nice to know that she won't be able to talk for a while in the future.

Im convinced that John likes my girlfriend and is trying to make advances on her. This is due to the fact that he messages her out of nowhere after two months of not talking, wants to exchange music, and is demonstrating behavior of wanting to get to know someone. Again, John doesnt know that her and I are dating.

Is it ridiculous to tell her that I think John likes her? Or to ask her to stop talking to him as much? They have been texting pretty frequently since the first message. She says that she thinks John is ""just bored"" but he doesn't exhibit behaviors that a person who is ""just bored"" would be doing. Even still, why does she want to talk to someone who is only talking to her because he is just bored?

I plan to tell my girlfriend about my concerns tomorrow, but I want to know if I am being ridiculous beforehand. I appreciate any and all advice, thanks.

t3_1lzqvqq,Is this a scam? Or someone,"I matched with this person and we had been talking for at least a month but they seemed very reserved and restricted by time. We agreed to go on a date at a coffee shop but the day before they asked if we could meet at a grocery store before. This is where she works

When we met they were late but came to my car. They told me they were being tracked by their roommate and boss (same person) and couldn't leave but we could talk in the car. She thinks her car is bugged, that her roommate is dangerous, he has guns,, but she does additional side jobs for him (commercial cleaning /painting) that pays her a decent amount of money.  I tried to get her to leave with me but she didn't want to. That was maybe 3 weeks ago

 For the last week she has had almost no communication with me but I see she is online a lot. This is somewhat normal as she insisted her communicating with me had to be discrete.

We haven't video talked for a week and she hasn't responded to me for several days. I understand this is a very odd situation. I'm thinking she is probably not in danger, maybe this is an elaborate way of ghosting? 

I guess I feel bad to cut her off but this whole situation is really affecting my headspace. She lives and works an hour away so I don't want to drive there unnecessarily especially not knowing her work schedule

Any ideas? Should I be expecting a request for a big sum of money soon?

I also feel silly because he does give his dog more attention than me and it makes me feel silly to even compare but if you saw in person you would understand . He’s just closer to his dog than any other human to the point where he lets her near dinning table while we’re eating and I kinda had to enforce a boundary like I love dogs too but there’s certain places they shouldn’t be so close to specially when were eating . In general it has felt anti climactic not romantic at all and maybe I’m comparing it to my last relationship (he was Hispanic ) but my ex was so inlove with me I could literally feel it all the time .

Classes finished in early May, and everyone went their separate ways for the summer. Fast forward two months to a few days ago, and John messaged my girlfriend on Instagram asking how her summer classes are going. I didn't think much of anything at this point. She also told me that he texted her when it happened. When I called my girlfriend that night, she told me that John wants to exchange spotify playlists with her, to which I responded ""interesting"" and ""are you going to?"" Because I wasn't really sure how to respond. When we were talking, music is one of the first things we bonded over as we made each other playlists. She said she is going to, but needs to organize her playlists first.

Fast forward to our call on the day after this, and she tells me that John is still talking to her. I asked what they were talking about, and she said that he's asking some questions to get to know her like how many sisters she has and things like that. I explained how this made me uncomfortable because music is one of the things we bonded over, and I thought it was extremely strange that after not talking for two months, he all of a sudden wants to exchange music and get to know her. Combine this with the fact that John doesn't know we are bf/gf, and it sounds like trouble. She asked me if I want her to keep being normal, or be dry with John. I told her to be normal but keep me updated. I wanted to tell her to be dry, but it seemed controlling.

I am writing this the following day. I've been thinking about the situation the entire day. What also happened today was I asked her a question that required some thought, and she said to ""give me a bit I'm out rn"" so i said okay (which she read my message). I had to wait seven hours for a response when she is just asking to call. On the call I asked what she was doing and she explained her day. She had plenty of chances to text back from what it sounded like. I told her that it would be nice to know that she won't be able to talk for a while in the future.

Im convinced that John likes my girlfriend and is trying to make advances on her. This is due to the fact that he messages her out of nowhere after two months of not talking, wants to exchange music, and is demonstrating behavior of wanting to get to know someone. Again, John doesnt know that her and I are dating.

Is it ridiculous to tell her that I think John likes her? Or to ask her to stop talking to him as much? They have been texting pretty frequently since the first message. She says that she thinks John is ""just bored"" but he doesn't exhibit behaviors that a person who is ""just bored"" would be doing. Even still, why does she want to talk to someone who is only talking to her because he is just bored?

I plan to tell my girlfriend about my concerns tomorrow, but I want to know if I am being ridiculous beforehand. I appreciate any and all advice, thanks.",Primary-Class-6414,General consent ambiguity,Medium
t3_1lr7qgp,"My friend and me keep kissing on nights out, what does it mean?  (both female)","Hello everyone!

I'm posting to ask for some advice about a friend.

Tldr: we keep getting drunk and making out. Is this normal?

I have a very good friend that I've made since moving to Canada a year ago from the UK. We worked together and instantly bonded, and when I left the job we stayed in touch as friends and met up every now and then. She is bisexual, I am pansexual.- both in our late 20s.

I went out for drinks with her just to hang out, and we ended up getting very drunk and going to a drag club together just the two of us. We took a second to sit outside in their garden area - a few people were around but not many- and she asked if she could kiss me. We did, it was great but we were very drunk and when we pulled away she immediately said, 'I kiss all my female friends' so I replied 'me too' (A panicked lie on my part, never kissed any female friend that I wasn't on a date with) We kissed again, she added tongue and I pulled back because it took me by surprise. She apologised a lot, I said it was okay and we went back inside.

We then kissed a LOT more that night. This was I want to say about a month ago? I felt, a little confused by it but pleasantly surprised, assumed it was a one off and sort of let it go because we were drunk.

Fast forward to a few days ago, we went out for Pride together. Got very drunk at her house (again, tequila) and then made our way down to the village just the two of us.

We kissed again, this time without asking each other, it just happened. We were drinking a lot, but we kissed about five times overall? Each time initiated by her. 

The thing is, she also kissed some random guys walking past, which is totally fine (genuinely no feelings of unease or jealousy).. She talks about guys shes interested in to me, and has never talked about fancying any women. So I've just be thinking about it, a lot, and I can't figure it out.

What does it mean?? Is it, that she's just a friend and we kiss when we're drunk and that's fine? That she just likes to kiss in general when she's drunk? The kisses got quite passionate, but I can't remember if she touched my face at all (too drunk).

I know that some women kiss friends as a fun thing, or in a fun performative way, but it has literally just been me and her every time..

Is it that she maybe is interested in me but has to be really drunk to kiss me? (she hasn't been intimate with a woman before and I don't want to make her uncomfortable)

The other thing is, we don't talk about it. I sent a text the next morning when she asked what had happened telling her we had kissed a bunch but that I hoped she didn't feel weird about it, and she said 'no weirdness on my end'. Which obviously, is great but we didn't talk about it more, and I just feel very puzzled by the whole thing.

I know none of you know her, and you can't answer like she can if I was brave enough to bring it up. But did any of you kiss your female friends on nights out just for fun? I've seen straight friends kiss girls on nights out just for the hell of it. And in media too, like in an episode of New Girl I'm pretty sure it happens.

It's not something I've experienced, and if that is all it is, if I am just a mouth to make out with in a drunken state thats fine I can accept it. But I need to know if you guys think it sounds like it could be more or if i am majorly overthinking please.

I also worry that if this keeps happening, I'll start to get feelings for her.. each kiss has felt more intense than the last. I don't want to ruin a friendship by stopping them and to be frank, I don't want them to stop.

Do you make out with friends on nights out? Is this normal? I'm relatively new to accepting my sexuality but she doesn't know this.

Also just to say, she hasn't started texting me more, but we hung out much sooner after the first kiss incident than we normally do and she organised it. She also isn't super flirty with me, but did tell me I looked nice before we went out for Pride- But in a friend way, like girls do..

t3_1lon535,Realizing how much online dating is messing with my head…,"I’ve been struggling a ton the past month or so because I’m realizing that dating apps lead to what I can only describe as choice paralysis? Maybe that’s not the best phrase but here’s what I mean.

I started online dating last year and have been on around 10-15 first dates. Some led to hookups/casual and some led to nothing and a few got very close to relationships.

Normally, I’m a very anxious attached person but recently, I’ve been struggling. I’ve met some really incredible men that make it clear they want a relationship with me. Usually, in a semi-love bombing way.

Recently, I started seeing this guy and he’s great and so sweet and kind. He is not really my normal type but I’m excited to see where it goes. But I can’t help but question if there are “better” options for me out there. (god, feels grimy to say it like that, I’m not trying to imply that I’m better than anyone or anything but just whether or not there’s something even better out there aka someone I’m even MORE compatible with)

In the past when I’ve felt this feeling of “I should keep exploring” I thought it was just because the person wasn’t for me. Now, I’m really questioning if it’s just because there are other options available to me and I don’t want to settle. But I don’t want to be in an endless loop of hoping there’s something better because the option in front of me isn’t picture perfect.

Does anyone feel like this or know what the hell I’m talking about? I just kind of need some advice on changing my mindset or if I’m crazy and this is just a matter of no attraction or something with the men that I’m seeing",ariesgoneawry,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1lowuzf,Thought i hit off with a girl but she withdrew and blocked me.,"So i've been talking to this girl for about two weeks, On Taimi. Well she was really kind and loud which i liked about her. She started supporting my hobbies we talked deeply for hours i was even honest to her about a certain kink that i have. She was honest with me and admitted that dating wasn't easy for her and a bunch of people on taimi just wanted nudes or sex with her. She said that i was the only person she could actually hold a conversation with. Dating nowadays i feel is normalized to be toxic and ghost people or keep them just interested enough to string them along or be straight up creeps. She tried to wiggle out of our date one time because she recently got out of a bad relationship with her her manipulative ex. I was honestly quite done with her at that point i honestly didn't care if the date happened or not i've had such bad luck with dating apps and people on said dating apps. People being flaky on me is a pet peeve of mine. We had lunch at a nice restaurant she got a flat tire somehow and asked if i could give her a ride so i did we went walking around exploring which was nice but i noticed that she didn't really seem interested as i was so i tried to go tour next destination which was the theatre but we had a stop at Barnes and noble's then had ice cream. I met some of her work friends in the parking lot and i saw her mom. I honestly thought the date was going spectacularly, I asked for a kiss which she thought was cute in my car then we went to the movies she was nice to some kids then we had some edibles that i had asked for. At this point the date was top tier the best date i had ever had with somebody. I'm not proud of the next part of the story but i think if i want an honest answer from people i'll have to be honest. when we sat down in our seat's i started cuddling her which we had done some already but i was really into her and it'd been awhile since i cuddled someone i asked her if i could be handsy and so i was then i asked for kisses like open mouth kisses with Toung which i thought was really hot. i barely paid attention to the movie i was busy exploring her body up and down by then the edibles kicked in and i just felt comfortable with her she kept texting on her phone about something but i didn't ask so i wasn't being nosey. at this point everything seemed fine she seemed okay with it and i was into it. well when the movie ended i did the stupidest thing imaginable i suggested that i still wanted to hang out but i was blitzed and horny. So i suggested that maybe we could get a hotel and cuddle. well at that point i could literally feel her mood shift on me and she was about to ask what else ae we going to do to she had to go home. well i got in my car with her and i asked for more kisses which she accommodated. At this point i was trying to think how much of a idiot desperate loser i was for being so creepy. though i was too stoned and oblivious to what was going on to think rationally. i asked if she wanted to be girlfriend boyfriend on the car ride over to her place and she said that is something a middle schooler would ask and suggested maybe a second date first. i know that this was completely cringe of me now but thinking on it makes my stomach turn. well i made it to her house and i dropped her off at that point i knew the date was a complete failure. She didn't text me at all the entire rest of the day. i tried texting her a few too many times and when i got an answer she was kurt and not talkative. This was today i thought she had ghosted me which i'm used to at this point though i don't act like this on a normal date with someone. we talked a little and said she wasn't into me like i was into her. she kept ignoring me so i kept texting her why she felt the way she did. The short answer ""It's me not you."" I guess i was annoying her at this point cause she didn't want to talk to me then she started getting nasty with me comparing me to her ex and acting like a kicked puppy. Well yeah i'm gonna be sad that you don't like me and i'm gonna ask why. she never told me specifically why but i kinda know it was cause i was acting a little creepy and she wasn't into me at all. though I know it had something to do with my kink as well, but she was done talking to me and told me to eff off essentially then blocked me on everything. I feel bad about it but now i just feel worse going through it again in story format. I liked her but she didn't like me one bit it seems. to her i'm as good as dead after one date which is kinda crazy to me and i just want some answers.",Alternative-Wave3652,Emotional pressure,High
t3_1ljy1uu,First Date (?) Advice/help? (X-posted to trans lesbians),"

TL;DR: I need help figuring out if this person likes me, or if I'm projecting my own feelings. New to dating since transitioning. 

Hey all, thanks for reading. I (33 Transfemme) was working at a site with Z (22 bi cis female), but not directly with her in any capacity. 
On her like first day, she approached me while we were both working in the same area, and engaged in small talk with me. No one really approaches me to talk, so I found it peculiar, but chalked it up to her being friendly. 
But whenever we'd both be working in the same spot, she'd make an effort to talk to me, or at least wave if I saw her at a distance. I began to do the same, and our conversations drifted to hobbies, music, to eventually politics, religion, things way outside what I'd consider normal work.  I quickly realized I was looking forward to seeing her, my mental tail wagging, I'd catch myself looking for her. 
When my contract for the site was going to run up, she expressed being sad that she wouldn't see me anymore, and I offered my number, and she took it, in shaky hands, which for me was the first sign she maybe liked me. When I like someone, my hands shake like that.  
My contract was renewed for a while so we had to put off hanging out outside of work, a rule for my licence. In the mean time, sometimes our goodbyes would be lingering fingertips like a Michaelangelo painting. And when she came to me to confide in me about a bad day she was having, she stood so close I had to resist every fiber in my being not to hold her. 

All this to say even before the first ""date"", she was behaving only ever happened to me when women were into me pre transition, but hasn't really happened at all since transitioning. 

While planning was hard, she responds to some of my messages with heart emojis, something again,  unusual for me. 

We met at a spot she loves, and was a fun new experience for me. She looked what I'd call dressed up, I was, her outfit is pretty revealing, more than any woman ever has worn with me on a date. Early on she mentions that she's gone their since her teens, brought her first romantic partner there's her longest relationship, her most recent one, and now, me. And I couldn't help notice the juxtaposition there. She didn't mention friends just exes and current interests. 

 Our conversation ranged wildly from work gossip unchained to politics. And as we talk I swear we're easily flirting, when I take the bill that was just given like we were together, she called me annoying, and I taunted her asking what she'd do about it, she said she'd tackle, choke me, I invited her to. We planned our next outing, she asked me to teach her to play pool, something I love, and said she'd like to go out drinking, and seeing local gay bars, which I'm happy to oblige in. She asked what I liked to read, and made a joke that I like reading her. 

As dinner wonder down, she asked if I was in a relationship, that she'd noticed my wedding band for months but never asked. I explained yes, I'm married and since she'd repeatedly mentioned wanting transparency in any relationship, I mentioned that I hadn't been aware if she'd wanted this to be a date- she cut me off, going from deer in headlights to sputtering and looking down like a rom com about how no, absolutely not, that we're definitely just friends,  that she wouldn't wanna be disrespectful, that she should've invited my wife, and I had to stop her and say well no, you're allowed to have your own friends in a marriage, and that regardless, we're in an open/poly relationship, so even if she did feel that way, it's okay. I swear she was bright red, but said no, she wanted to be respectful, and that an ex once suggested it, all rapid fire before I could get a word in edge wise to tell her it's okay, her response is normal, that my spouse and I figured it out when we were older than her. 

I accepted we were just friends having dinner, but  she made several Freudian slips referring to it directly or implying it was a date, or how she'd told her Mom she was ""going out"" with me tonight. She even caught her self and blamed me,  humorously.

Walking her back to her car she showed me some of her tattoos I hadn't seen, some she literally flashed me her panties to show, but didn't even vaguely hesitate like she wanted to hug before we got in our cars. I texted her when we both got home, mentioned I'd put together plans for pool when she got back from a week trip she's taking for a concert. 

In my mind: 
-hand holding, 
-personal space
-interest in me
-sexual banter
-flaunting her body
-turning red/stuttering

All point toward she likes me,  but I'm also accutely aware that I like her, and most of my socialization around dating was male socialization. 

-Does she like me?
-Is Gen Z just different? 
-Was it as much a date in all but name as I perceived it to be? 

Please help, I feel like a teenager lol

t3_1lohgko,18M 37F,"I am 18 years old just graduated from high school starting college soon and around my last month of high school i met this woman online on Facebook, i have a fake account cause i don't use Facebook, only for market place. We start talking and getting to know each other and it turns out she is 37 and i revealed my actually age (18) and she was fine with that. I know that some people may think that the situation is weird and it is but we both love each other. around our first month together my parents found out about her age and weren't too happy, now they are slowly becoming ok with it but it still isn't normal for them. 

Just a week ago i got in a terrible car crash, fell asleep at the wheel and wrecked my car, i almost died and came out with minor injuries. My parents were out of town so i had to go to her parents house cause it was closer, and i met her mother cause i had no where else to go, and as of a couple days ago her mom found out about my age from the police report I'm guessing, and talked to my girlfriend about it. And basically we might have to break up, neither of us want to but she is ready for kids and to get married and if I'm being honest i would mind having a kid with her, marriage perhaps in the future, but she wants those things immediately and this is the pebble in our relationship, we make each other happy and i even sleep at her house most nights. And she already has 2 kids and i like hanging out with both of them cause in a way its like having younger siblings. 

But she says she doesn't want to ruin my life or ruin my life opportunities but i feel like she can help me grow, my life may have just started but i want it to start with her. We love each other dearly and i cant let go. What do i do, i don't want to break up and she doesn't either but she says we should still break up.

t3_1lhwcl9,Is it time to move on?,"Before I start writing I know we aren’t all perfect and relationships can be complicated. 
My partner (27M) and I (24F) have been going out for 5 years and honestly we met on tinder it was just after Covid, I genuinely didn’t think anything of it, I was more thinking of it as a fling as my last relationship before him was a whole year before him and I didn’t think long term relationships existed on tinder. the moment I saw him I loved him red flag probably but he was amazing he would make the effort to drive 40 minutes to see me every night he would just make me laugh with the things he would say. He felt himself around me and I felt myslef around him. we even had a surprise best surprise. I became pregnant to a little boy. He was amazing through it obviously I would have rather miss work to come to a few more appointments but it doesn’t work like that and we needed as much money before the little guy arrived. 

We became parents and it’s true what they say a baby in the mix of a new relationship can really make it a challenge. sleepless nights, a baby needing us 24/7 we didn’t have a lot of time for each other. It’s pretty normal that. A newborn is hard not as hard as toddlers may I add lol. now we have a 3 year old who is full on but he brings me great joy and he literally saved me. 

my mental health has been rubbish for the past year with all different things that’s going on mentally and physically I’ve been quite ill too plus on top of that my father has dementia/Alzheimer’s and on top of that Parkinson’s too. I’m going through a lot of grief I guess and when someone is depressed I think it’s hard for the other person. I think this year we have had more arguments than any other year. There would be times where he just doesn’t understand at all and it’s like he doesn’t want to understand. 
We would get into fights because I’m doing nothing and he’s doing so much more. I am there for him no matter what, I get nice gifts for birthdays and Christmas’s even for his family. I plan holidays for the two of us, he games every night and I know most gfs would moan but I really don’t mind. I look after our son while he does his thing on the weekend even when I’m literally throwing my guts up because of how ill I am. I make effort with his family for him. I support him. Yes I’m emotional and moan but it’s because I want him to understand how this makes me feel and understand that sometimes he doesn’t show me support. (Mostly emotional support) but like we all do he gets defensive and continues to say I do my fair share. 

I feel like there’s no balance.  The only thing I don’t do is always tidy and make the house look spotless and cook his dinner for him coming home. 
Look I get it I stay at home while he’s at work and our son goes to nursery but I’m not a house wife I want to go out to see my parents, as I am carer for my dad too.  I don’t want to spend every day tidying, I have even taken up a diploma and having to hand in assessments every week, I even find that hard to keep on top of them, but it’s so I can get my life together. I don’t even have a hobby or do anything fun, there’s so much time in a day. I think I do a lot I think maybe both of us are going down different paths and not sure what’s there for the future and honestly it scares me. 

I want to marry him and he says he wants to marry me but his priorities are somewhere else.  if he wants too he would, right? 

He is the best dad the bestest. I just feel like I’m drowning while he has a stable job which is brilliant,  a car, hobbies and everything else while i literally have no idea who I am anymore. I feel as if I’m that parent that just has to deal with it. I think it’s important for couples to have time  together even with a child. I’m not sure if I still give him the excitement that I use to give him. But I’ve changed as a person there’s a lot of shit going on and sometimes i just want him to understand everything that I’ve been through and him that I’m still trying and wanting this and I do support him and I do a lot even with my mental health. I want to be wanted and I want to be a priority. but I just feel as if maybe our wants and needs don’t align up anymore.

t3_1lgkhew,Should I text her again or just let go?,"
Hi guys, I made this account just to ask this question and stay anonymous.

I met a girl a while back here on Reddit. She DM’d me first, and I’ll admit, I was suspicious at the start — like, why me? Is she legit? Is she catfishing me? Does she do this with everyone? But we kept chatting, and it actually went really well. The more we talked, the more comfortable I got, and eventually, I really wanted to meet her — partly to clear up all the doubts, and partly because I just really liked talking to her.

So I asked her to meet up, not expecting much, but to my surprise she said yes. I was over the moon. We exchanged numbers, socials, and as the day got closer, I got more and more excited.

When we finally met, it was a little awkward at first — like any first meeting would be — but honestly, my first impression was: she's the one. She was pretty, polite, smart, funny — basically the whole package. The date kept getting better and better, and I was genuinely happy.

But toward the end, she started dropping these little hints like “this won’t work out,” and I started getting mixed signals. We were still laughing and chatting like everything was fine, so I didn’t really know what to make of it.

After the date, we kept texting and everything seemed normal, but that night I brought it up. I asked her if everything was okay and mentioned the mixed signals. I just didn’t want to bottle it up — but now I kinda wish I had. It felt like I gave her an ""out"" she had already been looking for. She said she didn’t want to hurt me and that it’d be better to end it now before I wake up one day wondering what’s going on.

I was stunned. Before we met, everything felt perfect.

A few days later I texted her again and asked if I had done or said something wrong. She said no — that I was kind and sweet, and she hadn’t really believed it until we met in person. She just gave me the “it’s not you, it’s me” thing.

We haven’t talked since. It’s been a while.

So now I’m stuck wondering — should I text her again or just let it go?

She was the only person in years who texted me “good morning” just because. The only one who checked in on me without needing something. When we talked, I felt like we were actually on the same level — like she got me.

But I don’t know what to do. Move on like she asked? Reach out again? Or just wait and hope maybe she hits me up?",Secret-Idea1908,Mixed signals,High
t3_1let620,Seeking advice on managing early-stage dating,"Hey everyone, I’m looking for some advice on online dating.

I’m a 22M, recently graduated from university and just started a full-time job. I’ve never had a girlfriend before — I was pretty focused on school and building my career. I recently downloaded Hinge and, to my surprise, I’ve been getting a decent number of matches. I’ve already been on one date and have a second lined up next week.

The thing is, I don’t have a ton of time — I can realistically only go on maybe two dates a week — and I’m not sure how to manage multiple early-stage conversations and dates. I don’t want to ghost anyone or come off as insincere, but I also feel like it’s too early to commit to just one person after a date or two.

For context, I’m primarily looking for something serious, but I’m also open to some short-term fun along the way, as long as it’s respectful and mutual.

Is it normal to keep chatting with and meeting multiple people early on, or does that make me kind of an asshole? My thinking is that early dating is naturally a filtering process — not every first date turns into something — so I don’t want to shut myself off too soon.

You walk into the party and instantly feel like you're out of place. Everyone's already talking, laughing, going in and out of conversations, it's like you're the only one who didn't get the script. You try scanning the room for a familiar face, but you're all alone here. Your stomach starts to tighten. You try rehearsing what to say to the next person you see, then don't say it. At this point there's a baseball sized lump in your throat, your minds running a mile a minute, and there's nothing you can do but think *Maybe I should've just* stayed *home.*

It might not be a party but if you can relate to suddenly forgetting how to be yourself, in the face of social situations, then keep reading. I know the feeling all too well but I did overcome it, and so can you. I'll try my best to help you understand what you're dealing with and how to overcome it in just 3 steps, and give you a couple tricks I used myself to get over my own social anxiety.

**Step 1: Understanding What Social Anxiety Really Is.**

Social anxiety isn't just being ""shy"" or ""awkward"". It's a real fight-or-flight response triggered by a fear of being judged, rejected, or humiliated (or all of the above). Unfortunately, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, [social anxiety disorder affects about 7% of U.S. adults](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/social-anxiety-disorder) each year. That's millions of people, many of whom who don't even realize what happens to them has a name, let alone is beatable.

But there's good news here too.

1. No matter how bad you think your anxiety is, you're not alone, there's people who have gone through what you've gone through and come out on the other side.
2. Social anxiety is luckily, one of the most treatable mental health issues out there.

**Step 2: EXPOSURE is the Antidote.**

I'll just rip off the band-aid: **avoiding situations that cause you anxiety is only going to make those fears stronger.** The best ""fix"" for social anxiety, is **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).**

Within CBT, there's 2 main points of focus:

1. *Rewiring Your Brain's Self-Talk*

The real reason you get anxiety attacks in social situations, is your thought processes behind these situations. Thought processes that often aren't based in reality but in your internal insecurities. **So before you can focus on how you interact with others, you first need to fix how you interact with yourself.**Negative self-talk such as:

* *I can feel everyone staring at me*
   * This is really just your fear of being the center of attention. I promise you, nobody is staring at you, no matter how hard the anxiety is yelling that they are.
* *I hope the cashier doesn't think I sound stupid*
   * This is really just your fear of ridicule or being embarrassed. Here's the truth about that, 9/10 the Pizza Hut cashier on the other side of the line isn't going to remember that you stuttered getting out your order. But, social anxiety will have you repeating that stutter over and over in your head for the next 2 days until you decide to boycott ordering on the phone at all.
* *Everyone see's how nervous I am*
   * This is really just your fear of judgement, your worried others can see your anxiety and will negatively judge you for it. In reality, nobody can tell you're nervous because they're so focused on themselves.

So how do you fix these thoughts?

Challenge them.

Don't accept your thoughts for fact, automatic thoughts are a biological reaction not your truth. Here's how CBT helps:

* **Catch it**: What’s the anxious thought?
* **Check it**: Is it based on evidence or just a feeling?
* **Change it**: Replace it with something balanced and true.

For example:

* Anxious thought: “Everyone will notice I’m nervous.”
* Reality check: “Most people are focused on themselves.”
* Balanced response: “Even if I’m a little nervous, that’s normal, I can still connect with people and at least try to have a good time.""

Now I think you get the gist, but I obviously can't cover everything about thought reframing here, so [this is a great article on cognitive restructuring](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-cognitive-restructuring-3024490).

2. (The Hard Part) *Slowly Exposing Yourself To Anxiety-Inducing Situations*

Here's 3 easy steps, you can actually start right now (literally now):

A. You make a list of feared social situations (e.g., small talk with coworkers, speaking up in meetings, going to a party).

B. You rank them from least to most anxiety-provoking.

C. You slowly face each one, starting with the easiest.

Remember folks, this isn’t about throwing yourself into the deep end, it’s about building confidence by stacking small wins.

*Pro Tip: Track your anxiety levels in these situations, that'll allow you to really see your* progress\*. It's hard to know you grew until you look in a mirror.\*

**Step 3: The Daily Confidence Workout**

Just like going to the gym, social skills are a muscle, and you need reps in order to train that muscle. So it'd be wrong of me to say all this and not give you at least a starting point. So here's a weekly ""social reps"" routine:

* **Monday**: Record a 10-second voice memo to yourself.
   * Like auditory journaling, talk about your day, how you're feeling, whatever. This is just to build comfort with your own voice and expressions.
* **Tuesday**: Join an online community and make a post
   * This could be a question, a funny comment, an insightful, thought or just yapping. It doesn't need to be a big thing, this is just to get used to putting out your thoughts without fear of judgement.
* **Wednesday**: Compliment a stranger
   * Keep it simple. “Cool shoes,” “Love that jacket,” “Your dog is adorable.” Don’t overthink it. It’s less about what you say, more about getting used to speaking to strangers, in a pressure-free way.
* **Thursday**: Make small talk with a barista or cashier
   * Nothing fancy, just a “How’s your day going?” or a quick comment like “This place always smells amazing.” You're not trying to become best friends in 15 seconds. You're just building comfort initiating tiny conversations with zero stakes.
* **Friday**: Go to a social event (even for 20 mins)
   * Could be a game night, club meeting, getting drinks with some coworkers, open mic, any group space. Don’t pressure yourself to be the life of the party, your only job is to *show up*. Just putting yourself in those situations is a win.

At the beginning, it might feel impossible to compliment a stranger, but once you've done it a couple times it becomes almost second-nature. Trust me, I was once scared to order at the drive thru too, but I practiced socializing with people more and more, and talking to strangers is now one of my favorite things to do honestly.

t3_1l9yau0,I(20M) want to be with a girl(18F) but idk if she likes me back. I need help.,"So I(m20) met a girl(f18) through tinder. Our conversation was normal until she said she is looking to date and have fun (ie having sex, according to her), then it turned more sexual. We eventually met up and it after going back to her place we had sex. It was my first time and although I had difficulties, I made her enjoy every moment of it(we discussed it afterwards and I think she came 10 times).

I have learned that she has been abused in the past by people online and by her exes. She has told me she is affraid to attach herself to anyone and that is why she is not ready for a relationship. We have met two times afterwards, once I went shopping with her and her best friend(she told me I am a green flag and a good guy), and the same day we met at her place and had sex again. I try to make her feel good and wanted and I am sure she loves sex with me, others didn't really focus on her like I do. Anyway I slept over and the next day we had breakfast and sex again.

We talked too, I said I migh be catching feelings, she said she isn't ready for a relationship now. It's has nothing to do with me. I asked her to not see other people because it makes me feel horrible, makes me feel like I am not good enough. I said how would she feel if I saw other girls, she said not good but she wouldn't be able to do anything about it. I said I'll give her time, but I asked her not to see other people. She said we will try a relationship when she starts with therapy.

A bit of info about her: she has diagnosed ADHD, autism, depression and I think something more but can't remember. She is taking medication and she is starting therapy soon. She is honest and a very fun person to be around with. She is intelligent and fun to talk to. She thinks she is weird and maybe she is but that makes me like her. I'll call her Elsa.

Today I had a hard time reaching her, we talked about meeting today, I even messaged her bestie, she couldn't reach her either until 4 PM. She does that sometimes according to her bestie, like ignores everyone, even her best friend. In this instance she was asleep. I tried to talk to her but she wasn't really responsive. I asked her bestie about it and her bestie said she is busy. I asked if she knew what  was up to and she said that Elsa is on a date. My heart sank, I asked if it was okay if I talked to the her, that is the bestie, she said yes. So we talked, I told her a little about the situation and how it made me feel. She was supportive and understanding. Her bestie told me she was going to meet somebody around 7 PM, and I messaged Elsa that time, she said she was paying videogames.

Elsa eventually responded saying she was going to bed. I asked if she was with somebody, she said nobody except my teddy. I said we didn't meet today, she responded she was busy. Asked what she has been up to, and according to her she slept and watched series. I talked to her bestie about it and her bestie told me that Elsa told her she was going to meet somebody but didn't say if it was a date or not.

Now I don't know if Elsa lied to me, I plan to confront her tomorrow about it and her bestie is also going to ask her about it. It really hurts, I know she is not ready but I have let her know how much it hurt me. We are also going to my friends party on Saturday togheter so I am extra anxious now. I don't feel living, let alone doing anything else. I feel like trash. Elsa never lied to me before, I don't understand why she is doing it now.I really care for her, I want her to feel the best, I am always there for her, to hold her when she cries, to comfort her in the middle of the night after she has had a nightmare, to joke around with her, to make her fluster by saying naughty things to her. I want her just the way she is. And I thought she wanted me too.

I have attachment issues, she does that too. We are both afraid to be attached because we are scared to be hurt, and we have ""fallen in love"" with people because they gave us attention.

t3_1l0iaou,Guy advice,"I recently reconnected with an old friend from university. Eventually, I admitted that I used to have a crush on him. We had a good conversation, and I realized we share a similar kinky side. So, I asked if he was open to something casual, but he told me he was actually looking for a serious relationship.

Over the course of the week, we spent time together—we talked a lot, kissed, and eventually slept together. It was fun, intimate even. We had pillow talk and took a nap afterward, which felt comfortable and close.

But since then, his texting has dropped off. Before we met up, he was messaging me constantly throughout the day. Now, it’s just a few texts here and there. I asked him directly if he was still interested, and he said yes, but I’m feeling unsure.

This situation is triggering for me. Back in university, there was another guy I liked who asked me out, and then ghosted me the next day. Normally, I wouldn’t sleep with someone on a first date, but in both cases, I already had a history with them, so I felt safe and open to it. Now, I’m worried this might end the same way.

I honestly don’t mind if he’s no longer interested—I just don’t want to waste my time or energy. Am I overthinking this?",Lovelylostminds,General dating / relationship,Low

27m, Been on 50 first dates with 50 woman but no relationship

Hello all,

This is my first post in 3 years, trying to write as clear as possible. Thanks for reading in advance. I hope this is the correct place to post this.

As stated, I am a 27m and I have never been in a relationship. 

In dating, I am doing it the easy way, through dating apps. I have never approached a girl in real life. You already know when a girl likes you a bit when you go on a date, because she swiped you. Not all apps work, but breeze and bumble are working decently. With now and then, some matches.

I don't like to talk a lot on those apps. I just want to arrange a date to have a drink or a small walk so we can talk in person. 2 hours total max. Mostly this is fine for them too.

Before we go to the results, a little bit about myself. I am 6.3f. (many men are tall here too, so not special) , not fat just regular build. Based on my contact with woman, I would rate my face a 6/10. I work out 4 times a week. I have quite a lot of different interests, like playing guitar, books, musea, outdoors and love to try new stuff. I am also quite social, have different groups with friends. In the end I am just a normal guy ready to settle, no f boy or whatsoever.

Now, lets get deeper into the results. Of the 50 first dates with 50 different woman, about 60% said no to a 2nd date. It was mostly from their side,sometimes from mine. Fair enough tho. Of the other 20 woman I did have a 2nd date with, i continued with around 12 woman to a 3rd date. Finally, around 10 continued to a 4th date. And there's my magic number. I never get further than 4 dates. 

The interesting part. I've kissed with quite a lot. I initiate it normally around date 2 or 3 and also got laid with a few. But I never see them more than 4 times. 

The dates look like this:
Date 1: Drink or walk
Date 2: Walk or activity
Date 3: Activity
Date 4: activity, walk or mine or her place

I am sorry for the long text, but I am just struggling a lot with it lately. 2 days ago I thought I found the one, but she called me that she dident want to continue anymore. The last date we had (date 3 and 4 days ago) we spent the evening at my place, i cooked for her and we kissed. Everything seemed perfect. Before she left she kissed me, just to give that phone call a few days later. I don't get it.

So my question to both men and female is:
- Do you have advise what I am doing wrong?
- How can I approach this in the future?",Fair-Ladder-4042,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1kyxvf4,hello! I M17 am desperately in love with my girl bestfriend F18,"
Hello, so I M17 and my girl bestfriend F18 met maby 7 months ago at a mall with her at the time boyfriend, I became friends with both of them, and maby 3 or 4 months ago they broke up. To wich me and her kinda started hanging out 1 on 1 wich was purely coincidental but maby a month or two ago. It hit me that I might like her. I hoped at first it was a crush that would go away and I could just go back to things being the way they where. But they didn't. And won't. She asked me to go skating with her. Something wich is traditionally romantic, but I thought nothing of it, we went shopping prior where I convinced her to get a belt purely cuz I thought it was a cool belt wich she has worn every time iv seen her since except one. When we went skating she kept pulling me by my hands and going backwards. All while lip syncing whatever cheesy love songs where playing while looking right in my eyes. Wich is around when I realized I was very very very stuck. The hangout after that when we went shopping I carried all her stuff and with all this never once let her open a door. And when she tried on outfits she mostly asked if I thought it fit her general wardrobe. When we went skating again a second time she atleast 15 to 20 times brought up things I did as cute. Not saying ""your cute"" directly but repeatedly saying ""that was cute"" ""thats cute"" or just ""cute"" in all of this I started texting her goodmorning because usualy she's up early and I'm asleep late so I let it go on becausewas from my pov normal, she eventually requested I stop as it made her uncomfortable. Wich i respected. The next time we went out. We went skating again, where she challenged me to a race wich they have us perform in front of a crowd of people for free snacks. Where she proceeded to fall, and I won only because I didn't see she did or I'd have gone back for her. The time after that. We went shopping again, and she had me meet her at a forever 21. When we got there I let her know it looked closed. She looked around and we realized it was closed for good. And she proceeded to inform me that we where only there cuz she wanted me to go swimsuit shopping with her. Wich I thought was a very couple thing to do. We went to a mall and looked at other stores to wich I said oh shit I'm the only guy in here and she said, no there's plenty of girls with there boyfriends in here, and then asked if I think people assume me and her are boyfriend and girlfriend, not negatively, just matter of factly, to wich i panicked and shrugged. And at another store they openly reffered to her as my girlfriend and she didn't correct them or anything. And when she tried on closthes instead of asking abt what I thought of her wardrobe or smthn like that she explicitly wanted my opinions and thoughts on her deliberately. How i thought she looked. As herself. To wich i told her she looked amazing. She always always does. At another hang out wich had two of my frineds present we walked up to a seating area. My best friend sat in a seat. I walked towards the open one to wich she very verbaly told me to come sit next to her instead. I sat on the arm as i was too nervous and that is too this day my only regret iv ever had while hanging out with her. Our most recent hangout was at a beach, where she proceeded to ask me to sit in a very small almost caccoon like chair, with a small openingz and full enclosure. Ment for one child, not too near adults. Regaurdless she kept asking till i climbed in with her. And thats the closest to her iv ever been. We sat there talking pressed against each other for atleast half an hour befor deciding to go to the water, where she clung to me, almost fell, then did fall, all while grasping me for dear life. Even when she was clearly stable she kept her hands around either my arms or my hands. She also wanted to where my sweater because it was cold. She wore it 4.5 hours till I left, when I gave her an excuse of washing it for her to take it with her, and when I got home I told her to keep it because she looks better in it. She's also reffered to smthn i did as a redflag, it was a half jokey way but still that's usualy a term used for couples. She also said I did smthn the same way her ex did, a positive thing. she's trusted me with some very intimate and special things close to her heart. And im just grateful to have her in my life. I want to make a move but don't know how. I'm desperately in love with her. And someday I want her as my wife in adition",Old_Cabinet2466,Silence as consent,High
t3_1l09j19,An honest question about scary date.,"This was over a month ago now (finally met someone more on the same juice as me) but I can't get this creep that I dated out of my head. We hung out a total of four times. The first date was perfectly fine -- I thought he was a little bit creepy but I didn't have any ""proof"" and he seemed to really like me and want to please me. I should've listened to my instincts.

On the second meeting, he pulled out his phone to show me things on his social media page. His fyp was covered in 3D printed gun videos. I didn't really know what to make of that.

Third meeting I learn he is a gun enthusiast and was rejected from becoming a cop. I'm slowly but surely registering that this guy may be dangerous but still feel silly rejecting him. After this he contacts me one day and makes a joke about a family member of mine that I've never mentioned. He used my phone number to look up my whole family and where I'd lived etc. And he just casually made that joke even though I told him that it was a huge violation of my privacy.

I didn't want to see him again really and tried to fade but he kept calling me up and telling me he'd already gotten into a fight with his family over skipping a family holiday to see me. Like laying on the guilt thickly as if I asked him to do that. I stupidly relented because I am truly stupid.

By the fourth date he's applying way too much pressure for me to commit, admits to having a dom kink specifically around treating me ""like shit"" in front of his friends. so once I get home I finally end things over text by saying our political beliefs are incompatible (he's supposedly moderate but clearly very, very far right). He was a little angry and sent the typical insults but hasn't tried to contact me since.

I feel so uneasy just at the memory and wish I could scrub it all out of my mind. While I know now that this man is likely sick and would've become an abusive boyfriend had I continued, I can't help but wonder why he would've been rejected as a cop, why he was looking up 3D printed guns...he had a bunch of bulletproof vests that he proudly showed off. 

Seriously it's so dangerous out there right now for women, these guys are everywhere and he was so obviously and deeply insecure right away even without all of this. My line in the sand was the racist jokes and homophobia, all the micro aggressions against my girlier interests, but I looked right past these much more blatant red flags and tried to normalize them in my mind because I get bad/judgmental.

Just hoping now he doesn't snap and take his revenge or something. What do you make of all of this besides that I am deeply dumb and should never ever date again?

ETA: oh, during the third date he also told me he wears a gun everywhere he goes, including on our first date. We do not live in an area where conceal and carry is legal  at all.",No_Situation_7235,Emotional pressure,High
t3_1kkvpu9,Am I just overthinking?,"I just started talking to this girl, and things have been great.  But something she said just recently brought back feelings and memories of a past relationship, a relationship that did a lot of damage to me.  I worry this new girl has a lot of tendencies like the girl in my past, but at the same time, I feel I might be manifesting these negative feelings because of what she said.  I also worry since the new girl is like so many women in my past, I am just restarting a cycle of negative relationships.  I am at a crossroads now, either to move forward or to stop.  I feel it is unfair to the new girl, but what she said is not a normal thing to say in a healthy relationship.  I guess I wonder if I am projecting now.

t3_1kvx7nj,Wanting to give someone better a chance but not over old crush,"I apologize if my story is hard to understand as im just piecing up everything that comes to mind

i (m) had gotten set up with a girl by our mutual friends, we ended up talking to each other over text later that day and have continued for two weeks ( school break ). Initially i thought she was just a boring person but it turned out she was funny and had the same humor as me, which i find is kinda rare. she really has it all, shes funny, pretty, nice. I tried to avoid her for the first week of school because i was shy and scared to talk to her, my heart would go racing whenever i see her as i try to flee and not let her get a glimpse of me. But slowly we ended up talking properly and would spend everyday in school together, people also started to ship us which i guess kinda pressured me into forcing myself to look for a definitive answer as to whether i like her or not. I find her to be a great person and could see us together however its just extra time i need to really know how i feel, its quite obvious that she likes me too and i dont want to hurt her by leading her on or lose a chance with an amazing person who i bond well with. 

I have had this old crush of mine on a classmate for about 2 years now, im not sure if i could really label her as a crush but just a person who i like as we were sitting in a group one day and i just saw her smiling. I didnt really mind whether she liked me back or not because i also sort of liked someone else for longer at the time. I would create unrealistic fantasies with this old crush but would see her normally as just my classmate, of course i would admire her at times. I would also find out that she liked me too at the time but i wasnt interested in getting in a relationship with her because i was shy to ask her out and also that i knew there was someone else better for me because she did not match me at all, she seems like a person who i would not be able to talk to or bond with at all. Im not able to by myself around her because she judges me for being playful. 

Fast forward to before being set up with the girl. I really never had intense or deep feelings for the old crush rather just that shes there and is someone im able to like, i treat her just as a normal classmate and see her as one. So basically just as a friend because i have already made it clear to myself that i dont want to have anything to do with her because i think that i liked her because of the way i fantasized her and not actually her and that i just dont see myself and her in the future.

Now is around the time where i and the girl i got set up with, have actually started talking irl in school, lets name her Ava. While hanging out with Ava, sudden thoughts started to arise about whether i truly like her or not because i dont get the same intense dopamine sensation when im with her or think about her when compared to my older crushes. The thoughts are also about if i truly “got over” my old crush because at that same time the normal feelings and thoughts that i had for my old crush had suddenly turned into intense ones where i would over fantasize everything and would also get a heavy chest feeling whenever i see her in person, but over time the feelings and thoughts has started to lose grip as i started giving lesser thought towards it. Ava and i were becoming great friends

Moving onto present day, Ava and i have known each other for about two months now and have texted every single day since for hours. I genuinely enjoy texting her because shes funny and makes me happy, we usually have friendly banters and occasionally touching on deeper conversations, I also find myself staying up late at night for the sole reason of just texting her. Recently i have found myself spending more time with Ava and distancing myself away from my old crush (unintentionally) because we were able to choose any class that we wanted to go to. Being with Ava, i feel more comfortable and accepted because im able to be myself as well as just generally more happier, im excited on the days i get to meet her because shes fun to be around with. When im away from her i usually just long for her presence and wished that she was here with me just for the sake of having her present with me in the moment, i have never felt this way about someone before. We are so close that people have started asking us if we were together or not and i dont blame them, we are very physical with each other as in having lesser boundaries, unintentionally holding hands ( i remember this one moment where i was ecstatically jumping because i got to hold her hands for a few secs ), or sitting a bit TOO close to each other. However recently, the thoughts of the Old crush and being unsure has risen up again, this time its my brain presenting scenarios of me asking out my old crush and thoughts of “am i really sure that i like this person?” due to the fact that my brain is making up false fantasies. This has made my chest feel extremely heavy at times as i try to scramble for an answer but yet left with none. The thought of just cutting of Ava seems to be relieving at first but i think its just an irrational thought to quickly escape from these thoughts.
 
Those thoughts of “do i really like her” stem from the fact that being with her doesnt give me a surge of dopamine, elevated heart rate, or butterflies when compared to my old crushes. I think of her all the time but its just her, there is no image or voice of her in my mind, so it’s just her as a person and how i feel around her. Occasionally i find myself enjoying texting her then a sudden thought of “oh im supposed to feel more because i like her” comes and i start to force myself to like her. i feel the problem comes from me forcing my feelings, i know that it is there but im just forcing it a bit too much till the point where it makes me overthink causing my chest to feel heavy again. When thinking about Ava, sometimes the old crush also pops up in between and kinda clashes? i dont really know how to describe it. it has happened so much that when usually think of Ava, the old crush is suddenly popped up again. 

When thinking about the old crush, nothing in particular really stands out about her. I think its just built up fantasies of her over the past two years that is really messing up with my thought process. She has always been someone that is there just to like until i find someone else, it had been this way for a while until now. When i think of the old crush its usually just an image of her face or some made up scenario where dopamine starts flooding my brain. i dont know as to why this happens.

Prom is coming up soon and i have already thought of asking Ava out because a friend of her says she really wants me to ask her out and i was thinking of taking her as a friend however these imaginations of asking out my old crush keeps lingering and is messing with me. People have also expected me to ask out Ava for prom, in which i might as well not because people expect me to but because i want to.

I just want to know your thoughts and opinions on my matter and especially how to get over a fantasized crush rather than a crush that is based on genuine connection. I feel that my feelings for my old crush is also partly due to my unrealistic ideas and the theory of proximity, where im more exposed to her compared to other people so my brain takes it as a sense of familiarity and is trying every way that it can to revert it back to normal. Listening to romantic ish songs also bring back the thoughts because i would always associate her with those songs, how do i ‘unassociate’ her with those song? i just want to enjoy them

I really want to give a shot with Ava because i can see something new stirring or happening but its just these thoughts are leaving me in doubt. They usually come up when im alone in a vulnerable state where my mind starts overthinking, generally i feel normal when im with Ava except for today when my mind wouldnt stop circling.",Initial-Shock-8990,General dating / relationship,Low

i‘m f/22 and this guy is 22. 3 years ago him and i went to highschool. because i had to repeat 12th grade (he was therefore in my grade) we’ve only known each other for one year and than we gratuated. back than we never talked to each other, because i was almost never there (played sick a lot) and he was part of the boy’s group while i was more of an outsider if i was ever there. however now 3 years later he reached out to me on a random night and told me that he was kind of a fan of mine back than in school. i was actually really surprised and thought this was some kind of joke or something. he was actually genuinely interested in me. when i wouldn’t text him back he would send me another message and ask me questions. he told me that he thought i was beautiful back than and also kind of weird and he found me to be really interesting. he also told me that the reason he reaches out to me just now is because i was taken back than and he also only realised now that the old group chat from our class still existed. i was actually in a relationship though and told him „i’m sorry but i have a boyfriend“. he was disappointed but said „fine“. i obviously didn’t text him back, but he didn’t block me or anything and still followed me on instagram, eventhough he only followed a couple of people. so however, i actually broke up with my bf a couple of weeks later, it was a pretty toxic relationship and i have been wanting to leave for a while and now reached my point. i took 1-2 months for myself after that and didn’t talk to any guys, so i just can take my time with the break up. throughout that time though i constantly thought about this guy. what he said was really sweet and he’s also kind of my type. i started thinking more and more about him and told my friends about it. obviously they told me to reach out so i did. this was like 3 months after the last time we texted. i texted him that i’m single again and broke up with my boyfriend, the message ✅ immediately turned blue and he immediately texted „exactly today?” and i was like “no a while ago”. after two hours he texted me something like “good decision”. so i tried starting a conversation with him he actually had some pretty weird interest or opinions and asked me “you really want to get to know a guy like that” and i told him yeah and that i thought he was cute and that i’m pretty open minded anyways. after that it was all pretty weird. he would just ignore my messages for hours, when he texted back he would be give me like 4 messages at a time but than if i responded i would have to wait like 4 hours or something. yesterday he didn’t respond for 9 hours. is this normal or am i just overthinking it?

We lived together for a few years and had a child, he had issues with alcohol and drugs which I stupidly believed I could change (there was no physical abuse but a lot of emotional and financial abuse which I have worked through in counselling) unsurprisingly nothing changed and I chose to leave when kiddo was tiny. We are in contact due to our kiddo and co parenting has been rough but I know how to deal with him/coparenting so feel like that is a not an issue. That was 7+ years ago, since then I’ve had one “situationship” which was mutually agreed as FWB, he developed feelings and I didn’t so things ended, he was a nice guy but I felt no attachment to him other than a physical attraction. 
Apart from that I have made no serious attempts at dating, I have swiped on tinder sporadically and chatted with people for a few days before either get the ick or I just loose interest and stop communicating. I am chatty and social so will happily chat to people when out but haven’t ever met someone that I’ve considered dating. I don’t miss sex either despite having mainly positive experiences with ex partners. 
My close friends are either married or in long term relationships, they are all supportive of me, my child and my hobbies ect but whenever we go out the dating thing comes up and they all try to convince me I should chuck myself in to dating, they do back off when I say I’ve no interest but it’s quite clear they think my life would be better with a partner. My parents and siblings also constantly bring up the fact that I am single and haven’t attempted to date. I am beyond bored of the conversation around dating so very often just don’t engage and will leave the room. 
What I’m trying to figure out is if I am a bit odd for not wanting to date or have a partner? I have hobbies, a great job, brilliant kiddo, nice house so I genuinely don’t feel it would benefit my life, I can’t imagine ever sharing a house with a person other than my child and I just don’t see the point in adding the stress of dating or being with someone to my (what i think is a) pretty great life?? 
Am I traumatised by my previous relationship and need to go back to therapy or is this normal? Dating/having a partner seems to be the end goal in life for a lot of people, is it just a case that my end goal is different and that’s ok? ",Basic_Huckleberry181,Alcohol/substances,High

However, when I tell my younger brother he looks up her social media accounts and notices they share a lot of mutuals. She’s 18 but still in Highschool and my brother thinks it’s gross that I’m going out on a date with a girl people his own age probably. I wasn’t ever planning on being creepy or anything just taking her out for coffee and maybe food. But now I’m just wondering if I’m weird in general for even still considering it. Kinda wondering what my friends would think but at the same time idk, I was kinda looking forward to it and seeing her before all this.

this is our second time trying after we broke up in October last year. we’re in an LDR but our loves been strong enough to put through that and we were dating since Jan 2023. I plan to go to college in a city near her which would reduce  our distance from 1000kms in the same country to around 100kms which means I’d be able to see her more often.

last night, while we were having a normal conversation where I was talking about something I’m enthusiastic about I asked “ what are you currently excited about in life? “ 
to which she replied “ nothing I feel dead inside” and went on explaining how she has no interest for any person or thing in her life. 

which led to her saying “ idk why I’m trying again with you whether it’s out of guilt to fix w the things I did last time or is it love “ and I was baffled. for context we had our shortcomings because of her being avoidant and me being anxious but our issues are much better now. 

I feel kinda miserable hearing that now, like dude am I some charity? some kid dying of cancer? you’re talking to me because you might feel some pity for me?

t3_1kfl3fd,I need advice,"Context: I’m 18. Im using an alt account. I’m in a friendship trio me (M18) D(F18) R(F18). R is a lesbian and is best friends with D. Im fat not obese but I’m not average, I look like I weigh 100kg and I’m 5,9. A little while ago I had a surgery which made my dick look weird and it made it smaller I’m 3.5 inches



A few years ago I asked D out and she said she didn’t have the time as this was just before our GCSEs in the January, then in July during prom the 3 of us were getting a picture together, my mates was pissing about and I thought he was doing something with my phone so I go over and I only realised a few weeks later he recorded me walking over and in the background I’m 95% certain D looks at my arse or the other 5% she was looking at me in general cause I was going over to my mate

The 3 of us didn’t meet up for like a year, during this phase I was very depressed but that’s a different story, then in June last year D starts driving so we go on a little trip to McDonalds which was fun tbf, then during summer last year we had the first of many deep conversations where the first time we mainly talked about masterbating, then the 2nd time we played kill shag marry with people from our year group and all of our names we’re put in in a few separate occasions

We had a few more like the 2nd one, then one about innie and outie vsginas and talking about Ds expectations as I’m very insecure about my size and I wanna know like if she’d be into someone on the smaller side. 

Last month the 3 of us went to play golf and during the game D was being very extra towards me that wasn’t normal for her so that git my head spinning abit. Then the other week I can’t really remember but R said something about my weight that I took quite hard and I mentioned about how I might need to go on pills for my depression. Then she was comforting me and stuff over message which was like her. Then the 3 of us met up again like 2 days later and she dropped R off first then on the way she was talking similar to how she was at golf. 

Then yesterday we met up to have a pitch perfect marathon we watched the first one. Then during the 2nd one we played blackjack bananarama and I taught them both how to play 3 card poker, then we sat back on the sofas and we started rating each other R rated me a 2/10. While I rated her a 5/10. R is blonde, skinny with some long ass legs with nice curves and a decent arse with small tits. Then I rated D I rated a 7-8/10 she’s ginger with glasses shorter than R about 5,5 with a nice pair of tits and a nice arse, then she rated me a 5-6/10 which suprised me she said it was because I’m not a dick like most people in our year, I definitely wasn’t expecting that. Then we played marry shag kill again and then they were asking me what sex things Ik how todo. We’re all virgins so I’ve learnt most of my things from porn. I told them about how to make a woman squirt and how to eat a girl out. We also talked about like our love language types, I said avout flowers nice dinners, picnics watching the sunset. Its Just the way D has been acting is making me question some things

Conclusion: 1. Does dick size truly matter 2. Does weight size matter 3. Does a weird looking dick matter 4. From what I’ve said from my pov does she like me or am I over thinking it too much 5. If she does like me should I ask her and what do I do if she says she doesn’t have the time as she’s going to join the army and is leaving In September.

t3_1kcjxsi,I tried dating apps and I hate it.,"I feel guilty that i am somehow being so shallow? Actually just not me, no conversations are really deep, profiles are weird. I feel guilty about the fact that I've started to look at people at a surface level???? Something that i never used to, I like meeting people the way they are but there has to be something deep in order to connect. It's my first time using the app and I wonder how it's possible that the world, our words, profiles, the pressure to add ourselves in mere prompts and pictures, and being perceived about nothing???? Is it always so shallow? 

I am like 22, and i think i will stick to organically meeting someone, knowing them, learning about them. But i know that requires a lot more faith in fate (hehe) as we grow older. Yes, you can experience this with online apps too but idk. 

What would you suggest?

t3_1k9pk58,Is this guy (30M) hoping I'm (30F) interested in dating him? PART 2,"An update to the post I made earlier.

The short version is I've been talking to a guy I got acquainted with through online friends for about five weeks now with no intentions of romantic interest (presumably from either of us). However, we get along really well and our casual conversation has progressed in that time from frequent texts a week to multiple times daily and there is a natural playfulness that at times seems to border on flirtation. The only problem is, we live on completely opposite coasts from each other so that may be a significant impact to anything realistic happening between us long term. At first (and I discuss more in the original post) I thought he might be trying to get me to tell him if I was potentially be romantically interested in him, but since then he has gone out of his way to tell me that despite his overly friendly demeanor, he's in no way hitting on me. When it came up that we seemed kind of flirty he basically said: ""I'm not trying to be a typical guy hitting on you in your DMs. I'm not about that at all. if something happened in the future - not saying it will or that i am trying for that - I'd rather it be natural. My intentions have always just been building a connection."" Okay great, so he sees me as friend or at best he's definitely not interested in me right now, but here's why I'm confused...

In the last week or so (which was right after he reiterated he's not hitting on me) he seems like he's grown even more attached to me. He normally goes to bed very early because he has to get up extremely early for his work, but in the last week, he has stayed up every night at least about an hour or so after when he'd typically stop responding to me just to talk to me more. We are now constantly in communication and call or message continuously for about an hour before he goes to bed each day. I never initiate any of these sessions (I think he should try and get more sleep lol), but he repeatedly assures me he wants to stay up because he really enjoys talking to me. I don't have a relationship like this with any of my friends, but sure, he just really likes me as a friend?

Now here's where it gets extra sticky. This weekend I went out of town on where I didn't have cell phone service. when I got home he reiterated that he really missed me and was so happy I was back in cell service, which I thought was really sweet considering I was gone for only 48 hours. I sort of joked with him that I could catch feelings if he kept being that affectionate with me and he immediately brushed it off sarcastically like ""oh, so I can't tell you I miss you now ??? lol!"" I figured he would take that as very much me trying to initiate with me if he was interested in me so with the brush off I tell myself he's just interested in me as a friend. Again I'm firmly in the friend zone, that's great, I love having him as a friend!

But now the final piece which has left me totally confused. Yesterday I mentioned to him I was going out for drinks with some guys at my work (platonically! a networking event!) and he seemed to immediately shut down and get uncomfortable with me bringing that up to him. which... is not how I'd expect a friend to behave. I also kind of made a joke about how he's been staying up so late to talk to me and he'd actually get some sleep since I was going out. To which he responded (again sarcastically, he likes to joke, which makes it even harder to understand his meaning, lucky me!) ""well, I want to stay up late because i sort of kind of maybe care about you.""

is this normal friend behavior and I just haven't had something like this yet with a guy? what am I missing here!

TLDR; I have no idea what to do about this guy who seems interested in me, but won't actually express any feelings

No idea what I should be doing in response to him at all. Is the door still open if I take a back seat and let things ""progress naturally"" per his wording (advice on how to do that virtually?) or if I should just accept I've found a very good friend that seems to really cares about me.",Grouchy_Cupcake5871,Mixed signals,High

About 1 week ago she grew distant, and at the same time I get into a car accident and my truck is deemed unsalvageable, I got super busy with my 2 jobs and I had 2 family members have medical emergencies so I was super hectic the whole time. I let her know that I was super stressed and drained but I didn’t go into specifics because we weren’t super close or anything like that but I really did like her and told her that once I figured my stuff out we could go back to normal.

Me afab nonbinary (19) met this guy (27) on tinder I think, in January. Plz don't judge on the age gap lordy. Both looking for casual I don't really care about ""exclusivity"" or whatever, relationships have too many boxes.

Id say before I got blocked we were close friends. Maturely communicated and I was an outlet for him during some hard times he was going through. I really saw him in my 5 year plan, him and his roommate a good friend of his, who I was also becoming friends with.

Basically we were planning a date and conversation was better than ever last week. It all fell apart the last few days. Roommate opened up and needed a friend to rant to, and it got weird. Important context they have bpd. They are basically in love with him. the guy I like. And we're ranting about their feelings to me. I tried to set some boundaries cause I've been in ""love"" triangles or whatever before and I'm over it. I previously asked him if they were a thing a while back and it was a firm no. After I tried to set that boundary (basically I can't be your outlet about your feelings for him) they got nasty. For example: ""well he's not looking for anything serious, if that's changed I was not made aware of that"". Then they kept prying about my feelings (if I like him more than FWB).

t3_1k5f4g5,Slow Texter? Idk what to do.,"I (23M) went on a date with a girl (22F) from my college about 5 days ago. Overall, the date went great — we had lunch, walked around town, shared lots of laughs, and I even bought her a small gift that she asked for in one of the shops which she really liked. She seemed genuinely happy during the date, teased me playfully, and it ended on a positive note.

Two days after the date, I texted her something simple and kind: I told her I had a great time, and asked if she’d like to come to Sunday Mass and brunch. She responded 7 hours later that she already had plans. I replied warmly wishing her a Happy Easter, and asked if she’d like to try for next weekend instead.

It’s been two full days since then — no response.

Some context:  
- When I first asked her out, it took her several days and a follow-up to reply.  
- She’s generally a very slow texter.  
- I haven’t sent any additional texts after my last message — I’m trying to be respectful and give her space.  
- I know we only have about a month left of school before summer break, so time feels short.

I'm wondering:  
- Should I reach out again eventually?  
- Should I just let it be and leave the ball completely in her court?  
- Am I being too patient, or is this normal?

Would love some outside perspective. Thanks so much.

t3_1jwj734,Need Advice About This Guy,"I’ve been talking to someone for a while now. We went on one date and hung out another time but generally talk a bit every day. 
We live around 2 hrs apart so Snapchat/texting and video message is something we do everyday or occasionally depending on the communication type. Especially since he has some issues with driving (anxiety from driving trauma and some medical issues that prevent him from driving far distances)
This guy is very attractive to me and treats me how I want to be treated.
Where I’m conflicted is that he doesn’t have a job and still lives at home. The home part isn’t a big issue to me cuz it’s expensive living out here now a days but not having a job sort of stops me from continuing into something further with him. 
He has been applying for some jobs and he is in college classes as well. 
He’s is if not almost everything I would want in a partner. I can tell him anything, we can talk about whatever or nothing at all and be content. We are supportive of each other in so many ways.
With the distance being pretty far in my opinion (cuz I don’t have much money to drive that distance a lot) and him not having a job I’m not sure what to do. 
I have some relationship trauma from being SAed from my previous exes (one that was my husband) so I’m worried that plays too much into it, that I’m scared that it’s actually a “normal” relationship for the first time.

So I’m like 5-6 months into my relationship with my boyfriend and I’m trying to figure out if he is possessive or not, or if it is something similar.

Anyway, he has been almost accusing me of touching my guy friends side, mind you I’m a senior in high school still and my guy friend is a sophomore (I literally adopted him as my son in high school terms) but when I told my boyfriend that I literally put trash in his pocket and that was a normal thing, he got upset and basically told me to not do it again and just put trash in his pockets instead. Now my friend avoids my boyfriend anytime he is near me. 


My boyfriend has also been getting jealous over small things when I’m talking to my friends and get too close in general no matter the gender because I’m bi. Often he will make sure I don’t have a revealing outfit on, call me when I don’t answer his messages, have some physical contact to me when together(not in a hitting way, just wanted to be close), always wants to be near me, wants to go wherever I go when I want to go somewhere with friends, checking in on my constantly, checking my location on Life360, my followers where he has made me unfollow people simply cause he does not like them, stalk my social media accounts to see if I’m active when I’m not talking to him, and a lot more.

t3_1jqx58b,Advice for a 29-year-old man with no dating experience?,"I am a 29-year-old man who has never been on a date before, and am looking for advice on how best to move forward in this area of my life. Sorry for the novella, it's a trademark of mine at this point.

I am neurodivergent, officially diagnosed with ADHD but also likely autistic. These conditions have significantly impacted my life, causing me to struggle in areas which others did not and causing my life's trajectory to deviate from the average individual in my age bracket. In addition to poor academic performance and social success, they contributed to me developing a very low self-esteem, and coupled with a crippling fear of rejection that prevented me from pursuing girls/women altogether.

As I approach 30, I see that these self-esteem issues have been detrimental to me and I am no longer willing to be ruled by them. The sting of rejection can never exceed the existential pain of not having tried at all, and looking back on the years wondering how different my life could have looked had I not allowed self-defeating attitudes to hold me back. Despite my lack of dating experience, I have not become embittered towards women or fallen into 1nce1/r3dp111 rhetoric - but I do carry a major sadness within me, stemming from a recognition of all the lost years that can never be returned. There's a newfound sense of wistfulness I feel in the sight of girls in their teenage years or women in their early-to-mid-20's, whereby the members of this demographic have lost their individual qualities and have come to symbolize their age group as a whole. They provide a reminder of what the females around me looked like back when I was younger, ones whom I might have actually been able to enter a relationship with had I pursued them back then.

If it's worth mentioning, my body language enables people to recognize that there's something ""different"" about me even before we exchange words. So even though I dislike identifying with ADHD/autism/neurodivergence, and generally avoid mentioning these in social settings, other people can unfortunately clock me as an oddity regardless. 

My first preference is for neurodivergent women, as a result of forming a few Platonic connections with such women the past year and observing myself to feel an unspoken connection with them unlike what I've known with any neurotypical women. I was surprised at how comfortable and normal I felt around them, and now believe the happiest relationship I can be in is with a neurodivergent partner. However, these women are such a small percentage of the general population, and the subpopulation of those women who are in my age bracket, near me geographically, match my physical preferences and share my values is even smaller. So I am still very interested in dating neurotypical women, but wonder if I'll ever able to connect with them to the same degree as I do neurodivergent ones.

I don't want to ramble any further, so my broad question is whether there is literally _any_ advice that would be particularly relevant for someone of my background - that is, someone whose life experiences diverge from most of his same-aged peers, both in the sense of neurodivergence and also a turbulent academic and career history.  

If more information about me is needed, please ask it in the comments and I'll try to answer it (so long as it doesn't breach anonymity or exceed what I'm comfortable sharing publically). ",-AvatarAang-,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1jg8eko,I caught my bf talking and complementing another girl behind my back,"My boyfriend of 1 year and 3 months recently got Instagram again. I had his account but I guess he forgot? For context he had been acting strange a little but nothing really out of the ordinary but I definitely noticed. However when I asked him about it he would always say “no it’s nothing” but he would promise me. 
So the night before anything happened I just felt the need to ask “Do you really want this forever?” Because he wanted to marry me. And he hesitated and said “Yeahh?” So I’m just like  Ok! And fell asleep. 
The next day we woke up as normal and I FaceTimed him before he showered and he said he loved me and was gonna do the yard after so I’m like alrighty cool. For some odd reason I had had a dream 2 days prior about him cheating and it just unsettled me and I dream a lot of crazy things but this one stuck. So I logged into his account to ease my mind (he has mine too) because I thought “your being delusional” 
And I found messages with him and a girl. He was calling her ma and saying how much he liked her style and he wanted to meet up with her. So I screenshotted everything of course and I confronted him. Then he proceeds to call me and say “I don’t feel what I felt in the beginning I think it’s best if we break up” the he hung up! So I text the girl which she then tells me she wants nothing do with him and he had the audacity to text me about her later saying he wanted her so bad. He also sent me a screen shot of how she ignored him calling her “Fine shit” and she told him off because she’s cool with me and she already had someone.Come to find out a month prior he complimented her saying she looked good when I was out of town?! So then I called him the next day at night. I told him how I couldn’t believe any of if and how I still loved him because what I felt was real. I ran down my emotions to him and everything. And sure enough he started crying.  He told me how he knows he fucked up and he blocked the girl and she had been flirting with him and he never told me. He then said he wanted me back but I said I need time to think. What the hell do I do. I don’t need criticism right now in my eyes everyone deserves a second chance I mean is it even cheating? It’s deceiving what he did and hurtful. After knowing I’ve been cheated on before. Do I take him back? It’s gonna be hard to trust him of course but will he do it again? He definitely feels regret but I need male perspective or someone who’s been through this too. 

Please be nice in the comments!! Also keep in mind we’re a young couple and I believe everyone grows but still help me please!

t3_1jfvmsz,I (25m) feel insecure about my girlfriend’s (21f) relationships with other guys,"Hi,

I (25m) am feeling insecure in my relationship with my girlfriend (21f) due to her daily communication with several other guys via Snapchat as well as one of her relationships with a particular male friend. I need help navigating whether my worries are valid or if I’m just overreacting and being neurotic. I feel like I’m going crazy and would really appreciate some external input.

Last October, she moved to my city from another state halfway across the country for family reasons. We met on a dating app in November and hit it off. I fell hard for her; we have incredible chemistry and she makes me feel very happy and appreciated. She tells me she loves me along with things like “you mean the world to me” and “I don’t ever want to lose you.” But ever since we started dating exclusively I keep encountering situations that cause me deep feelings of insecurity and doubt.

The first is that whenever we hang out, we usually end up scrolling through her TikTok on her phone, and she is always getting Snapchat notifications from several different guys that I’ve never heard of from her town “back home.” I’m not exaggerating when I say it’s at least one every 30-40 mins, it’s always a guy, and there’s always the “🔥” emoji indicating a snap streak. There’s at least 7 or 8 different guys she’s maintaining these streaks with. I’ve never been much of a social media guy, so I don’t know if this is “normal,” but it makes me feel insecure. I don’t like that she gives and seeks so much attention to/from other guys. I don’t understand it and that makes it hard for me to determine if my aversion to this is warranted or just rooted in insecurity.

Shortly after we met, she confessed that her relocation to my city was supposed to be temporary and that she plans to move back “home” eventually. Lately however, she’s indicated that she may not move back “home,” at least not as soon as she first planned, partially due to our now-established relationship. She says she wants to be with me long-term, and I want to believe her because that’s what I want too and I really do believe she loves me and cares about me. But is it not contradictory of her to emphasize her faithfulness to our relationship while simultaneously communicating with almost a dozen of other guys daily? Am I wrong to feel doubt and insecurity over this?

My biggest fear is that she is keeping her options open for when she inevitably moves and that I’m just being used as a placeholder of sorts for the time being.

Shortly after we agreed to go exclusive and to delete our dating apps, she was showing me some TikToks on her phone and a Tinder notification popped up. I called her out on it and she broke down crying, claiming that she had trust issues from prior relationships and admitted that she, at the time, was still on Tinder to keep her options open in case we didn’t work out

What worries me the most is her relationship with her friend “Alex.” I noticed a couple of weeks ago that she was texting a lot with a contact named “Alex,” someone she had never mentioned anything about before. I’ll admit I was jealous of how much more she was texting him than she ever texts me, but I didn’t say anything until last week when she opened up her messages in front of me while we were cuddling and I saw that her last reply to him was “you’re so cute.” This ate at me and eventually she could tell something was off, so when she pressed me on it, I calmly told her that it hurt and felt like betrayal to see her flirting with another guy. She started crying and swore she wasn’t flirting and that he is just a good friend from “back home.” I asked for context and she said her reply was to a picture he sent of himself on the beach. I told her that really doesn’t help her case and that I don’t think most people would consider that a purely platonic interaction. I asked if she and “Alex” have any history and she said no. I told her that I need to be able to trust her in order for this to work and that I would never tell text a female friend “you are so cute” if I wasn’t hitting on her. She conceded that she would also be upset if she were in my position and then told me she has been cheated on in the past and felt terrible for putting me in a situation in which I had to practically beg her for the truth, much like she had to once. It was at this time that I also mentioned how uncomfortable it makes me that she entertains a dozen different guys daily on social media. If your partner communicates that something you’re doing is making them uncomfortable, wouldn’t you take it seriously and address it because you don’t want them to feel uncomfortable?
Last night, we were laying in bed and in the span of 5 minutes, 2 snapchat notifs popped up from these different guys she’s keeping streaks with, and then a text notification from “Alex” that said “I’m hella excited to see you again too 😜”. I know she’s flying back to her home state soon to visit and will surely hang out with “Alex.”

For context, I am aware that I have a bit of an anxious attachment style. I always try to factor this awareness into my thoughts and interactions pertaining to my relationships as part of my constant efforts to work towards a more secure attachment style. I would never attempt to control my girlfriend and am very mindful of not projecting my feelings of jealousy or insecurity onto her. I’m not going to ask to go through her phone or ask her to block any of her friends and I have no problem with her having platonic relationships with other guys. It’s important for me to have a relationship built on mutual trust. That’s why I’m struggling so much here: outside of these concerns, our relationship is nearly perfect. I love her and want to be with her and I want to trust her. But I also need to protect myself and look out for myself. I don’t want to fall even harder just to get hurt. I want to stick up for myself, but if my insecurities are unfounded, then I’m worried I'll ruin a potential long-term relationship with this woman whom I adore with my neurotic insecurities. Are my anxieties/feelings of insecurity valid? If so, how do I approach the issue with her without coming across as jealous or controlling? If not, is this just something I’m just going to have to come to terms with if I want to be with her long-term?

t3_1jd9l1k,"My ex girlfriend (22F) who broke up with me a month ago and I (22M) are currently in a period of no contact I chose to do. I'm am overthinking and struggling with what to do at the end of this period, how do you think I should behaviour at the end of the no contact period?","Our story in short: We met in 2022 when she visited her brother in the state where I live. Over the next two years, we stayed in touch, became best friends, and secretly developed feelings for each other. In early 2024, we acknowledged those feelings, but weren’t sure if we could make a long-distance relationship work. After briefly deciding we couldn’t, I chose to fight for us, and we had a healthy, happy long-distance relationship for 12 months.

After Christmas, she started overthinking our future and worrying about potential resentment down the road. On top of that, she was dealing with personal struggles, which she didn’t share with me. In January, we had one and a half arguments. The first was my fault, driven by my own overthinking and misguided emotions. I’ve taken full responsibility for that, and most people, including my counselor, believe we could work through it.

Over the next two weeks, we had emotional discussions about whether we could move past it. Eventually, she decided she needed time alone to grow, saying she couldn’t move past what happened. She was clearly conflicted and confused, and I didn’t believe she was fully committed to her decision.

That night, I told myself I would respect her choice. I chose not to chase or beg, understanding that I had to respect both her decision and my own emotional boundaries.

For the next two weeks, we kept in touch. We still loved each other and weren’t on bad terms, but she kept pushing boundaries, unwilling to fully let go. She even admitted to “grasping at the normal we used to share” after I expressed my pain over the breakup.

A week later, I helped her navigate a conflict with her mother and best friend regarding the breakup. Even though it was difficult for me, I could tell something was wrong, and she was grateful that I pushed to help. This, too, crossed emotional boundaries.

A close friend of mine suggested that no contact might be best for both of us, as we were keeping ourselves in a painful limbo. Initially, I resented that advice, but the more I thought about it, the more it made sense.

I called her to discuss the idea, and she agreed. She initially didn’t want a time frame, but I told her I thought it was necessary. She seemed to agree, though I don’t think she wanted it. She said she’d respect my wishes.

I’ve kept my emotions off social media, not wanting to seek attention or seem vulnerable.

Now, two weeks into no contact, some of her behavior has suggested she’s still conflicted, emotional about the situation, and seeking my attention. Multiple sources, not just my own overthinking, have confirmed this impression.

I’m nervous about what happens at the end of this period. I don’t think I’ll be ready to be in her life without being in a relationship, and no amount of overthinking will provide the answer on whether to try to win her back or to move on.

I don’t want to lose her from my life, but I might have to tell her I’m not ready for a friendship, which will hurt. Alternatively, I could try to rekindle our relationship, risking rejection.

What I know for sure is that I can’t stop thinking about the beauty of our past—every memory, thought, and vision of the future I had with her. Letting go of that won’t be easy.

Does anyone have advice on what to do in these final two weeks of no contact, and what to do (or not do) when it ends?

t3_1jc3f4e,Where am I going wrong?,"Heyyy everyone I was just wondering if anyone has any advice or maybe some insight into why my dating life follows a certain pattern. I’m a bit sick of repeating the same kind of behaviours but I’m not too sure why things are happening and I’d really like to change it. And i can’t afford to go back to therapy 👍🏻 
So essentially I don’t really struggle to attract people buttt once we are together things tend to not be good, a lot of arguments and tension, I am not the most open with my feelings initially but once given some time to think I am able to be. I’d say I have a more anxious attachment but maybe initially I come off as quite nonchalant but maybe this is normal idk? My most recent relationship was really fast and things got pretty toxic in a short amount of time. We argued a lot and I feel like as the relationship got emotionally testing I became quite highly strung feelings wise , which led to things ending mutually. But why the shift? Why am I normal at first then I become really emotionally volatile and upset.

t3_1jc4m9z,Advice for dating someone with no experience,"As title says, I’ve been dating someone for about 2 months who has no experience. She wanted to go slow as she’s never had a boyfriend or even done anything. She said a few weeks ago she was worried about holding me back because she wants to wait for everything (I assured her it was fine). 

She found out I wanted a relationship last week and we had an argument after she got jealous over something silly me then me getting annoyed that she wasn’t making any effort and constantly gets annoyed at me when I’m doing my best etc then when we spoke on the phone after calming down she said sometimes she feels ready then sometimes gets scared and thinks no I wanna be on my own. She said she knows she should just be enjoying it but she can’t she’s just stressed all the time.  She said she doesn’t wanna hold me back because she wants to wait for everything, which she clarified to mean a relationship, (I originally thought she meant physical stuff). I said what do you want to wait for, she said she needs to learn to love herself first. I asked if anything is gunna change in the next few  months she said she doesn’t know. She doesn’t want to hurt me but said she doesn’t want to lose me and doesn’t know if sheshe can cope with that and she wants it to work but is drained. She said she does really like me and she thought I knew that as I’m the only guy she’s ever given a chance to. 


Is she just playing games? I can’t work out if she’s just telling me what I want to hear to keep me striving along? Normally I would walk away at this point but because she’s knew to all this I’m inclined to keep it going? Has anyone got any advice on how to proceed? We’ve known each other about 4 months before this and part of me thinks would she really have this many doubts if she really liked me or is she genuinely just scared?

t3_1jcwr8o,Dating early stages: Am I self sabotaging,"Hello, so I’m 25(f) and I’ve currently started dating a guy, let’s call him Gary… he’s 6 years older than me and very independent. We obviously met on hinge and long story short we’ve gone on several dates over a span of a month but he’s absolutely awful at texting and replying to messages. Now I’ve been very hurt in the past by both guys. The first, who only seem interested in communicating when they want sex and second, the ones that have love bombed me beyond belief. Essentially, I always wind up getting hurt as I obviously have impeccable taste in men. ANYWAY we meet once every week or so and have been seeing each other for a month now.

Our dates normally consist of going out for food and having an additional drink at his place and I have stayed over a few times. But we have had very deep conversations none of which has revolved around what we’re both looking for, but I have made it clear to him I am a “relationship girl”.

Am I basically overthinking here? As I am automatically assuming he’s not interested in a serious relationship due to his communication. In person he’s very attentive and the mornings after I’ve stayed over I’m there until the following evening as he doesn’t want me to leave (I obviously want to be there too… not being held hostage). He’s currently on holiday and wished me happy birthday whilst he was away but as I tried to carry on the conversation he has just not replied. He comes back this week and I’m not making any attempt at organising seeing him as he’s obviously left me on read, and I REFUSE to double text so he can do the grafting. 

I’m wondering whether I just go an date other people if he’s not paying me the attention I want but also fully understand that he’s not obliged to do anything as nothing is exclusive. Or am I being too hasty?

Are we seeing any red flags or am I just self-sabotaging to avoid being hurt?

t3_1jd88h1,Navigating a Blurred Line: When Friendship Feels Like More,"I'm a 24M and had a female best friend in college. We were super close and could talk about anything. People thought we were a couple initially, but I never felt any romantic attraction—and I assumed she didn’t either. No grey areas, which was awesome. Then she started dating a guy, and I was happy for her until I saw how toxic their relationship was, with all the verbal and mental abuse she suffered. Plus, they were living together, which made it an inescapable hell.

Her closest female friend even urged her to break up, but they ended up arguing and lost their friendship. When I asked what happened, she said her boyfriend had everything she was looking for—looks, lifestyle goals etc. so she trusted her instinct and let that friendship go. Her mother had suffered domestic abuse at home so she felt it was normal. She felt that she can work through it and change her boyfriend. That left her other friends too scared to tell her to break up when things got bad.

With her friends not really being there for her, she started coming to me for comfort whenever her relationship turned bad. I cared about her and even got a bit angry, seeing echoes of my mom’s situation. We got really close, and while I wasn’t sure how to help, we gradually became physically comfortable—leaning on each other, holding hands, and even her having me lie on her lap while she stroked my hair. I was dealing with my own stuff, so it felt great to have someone care about me, and she really cared about my problems too.

People started suspecting something, but I denied it—even her toxic boyfriend admitted he felt insecure. I still didn’t feel any romantic spark, so I appreciated the clarity. Then, after a fight with her boyfriend, she stayed over at my place. This increased in frequency as they fought more often, sometimes leading her to stay for 3-4 consecutive nights. I’d sleep on the couch outside whenever she stayed over and let her sleep in my room. One night, after a night out, she was super drunk. I went to sleep on the couch, and an hour later she came out, sat next to me, rested my head on her lap, and, while stroking my hair, leaned in and kissed me—I was totally shocked! I was surprised but kinda liked it. Since she was still drunk, I told her to go back to the room and sleep. The next morning, I tried talking about it, but she acted like nothing happened—she didn’t remember a thing. I figured it was best to let it go.

Her stays continued. After taking a break from her relationship, she spent a week at my place. On the second night, she was sobbing uncontrollably and asked if I could sleep beside her. I wasn’t sure, but figured she needed a friend. We kept our distance but shared the bed. The next day, she came over again, and without thinking, I ended up on the bed too. We chatted for a few hours until I got sleepy, and she hugged me. I fell asleep immediately, and we woke up cuddling, then headed off to college without much word. Later, we went out for drinks—I got really drunk. Back home, we slept while hugging. I felt a spark, looked into her eyes, and went in for a kiss. The night blurred, and I woke up to find us both naked. A few minutes later, she started kissing me again. I pulled back to process it all, feeling guilty for dragging her into something messy. She later admitted that what we did wasn’t right, though she was a bit relieved she didn’t technically cheat since they were on a break. I stayed quiet, and she eventually left.

The next day at college, she checked in on me and I said I was fine. A week later, she asked to stay over again. I went to sleep on the couch, determined not to cross any lines. An hour later, she came out, asking me to come into the room repeatedly. I kept saying no and even asked why she needed me there. I hoped she’d understand, but I’m not sure she did. She went back to my room and left super early without saying much, and when I called, she didn’t answer.

A few days later, she asked why I hadn’t come into the room that night when she really needed me. I wanted to tell her I was starting to like her, that she should break up, and that I was angry about seeing the same patterns I saw with my mom, and if I'd slept beside her that night, we would've crossed lines. I didn't want to be involved in a situation where a girl cheats on her boyfriend because of me, I wouldn't want the same happening to me either. I got overwhelmed and ended up stonewalling her. It was my fault—I just couldn’t bring myself to say anything. She kept asking for days, and eventually, our friendship fizzled out. My emotional quotient was really low.

This was back in 2022, and she finally broke up with him in mid-2024 after growing out of the relationship. A few months later, while visiting my city, she texted to meet up. What she didn’t know was I’d been waiting for her message for two years and missed her every day. Facing my own emotional shortcomings after we drifted apart, I worked hard to improve over those two years.

I was really happy to see her again. We started talking about life, then decided to revisit our late college days and share our perspectives. She admitted that she had a spark whenever she met me, because of which she slept with me. We realized there were a lot of assumptions and miscommunications. She never told her boyfriend—or anyone else—about that drunken night or anything that had happened between us. I felt bad for the boyfriend, even though he was a prick, because he never knew the truth despite his suspicions.

We decided to start fresh and rebuild our friendship. In just a few days, we grew super close again, and I felt a spark. I wasn’t sure about making a move, but surprisingly, she did, and we ended up sleeping together again. I thought maybe we were meant to be, reconnecting after all this time, but she said we should just be friends because our lifestyle goals differ and it wouldn’t work out.

We’ve kept in touch since then. Even though she lives in another city, we talk at least twice a week for numerous hours. Lately, her signals have been all over the place—sometimes really warm, indirectly asking me to flirt with her and give attention, and sometimes cold. On one occasion, she sent me a gift, she asked me not to mention this to any of our mutual friends because she felt our friendship is already quite complicated. Next week, when I was being a bit flirty with her, she asked me to maintain boundaries because she doesn't feel anything romantically and there is nothing complicated between us. I care about her as a friend, but I’m starting to feel it’s more than that, even though she downplays our bond. For example, when we talked about safe places, I mentioned she stayed over at my place instead of with other friends because she probably felt safer with me. She said it was just because I had context about her relationship situation. Sometimes, when I get distant trying to protect my peace, she suddenly warms up and pulls me back in. I had asked her to take a trip with me earlier, and she declined saying it's too complicated while also giving me a really bright smile, but just a few days back, she asked me if we can take a trip. 

Now I’m really confused about what to do next, what to expect, and if I’m missing something. Am I just being a hopeless romantic, expecting us to eventually start dating? Her not telling her boyfriend about us is a huge red flag for me. Is that something I should seriously consider? I don’t want to keep questioning our bond every single day. Any advice on how to move forward?",_sapnu-_-puas_,Mixed signals,High
t3_1j9kjzq,Wild Orbiting Situation...She watches &amp; is SO Locked in BUT...,"I'll try to give the short story without leaving anything out...but I recently just began therapy over this as I realized how emotionally invested I am in this young woman...  
  
For starters:   
I'm in my 30s....she's in her 20s....we were around each other daily professionally for 2 years circa 2016-2017. We got really close and emotionally attached meaning she'd always come sit by me when she had the chance, we talked constantly, even had some light touching when talking (she'd cross her legs and have her foot under my leg, etc). When she left the workplace I was distraught, but she started viewing all my Instagram stories...which was validating for me. This has kept up until recently. 

More history:   
A couple years ago, She posted a stunning picture on her IG story one day...which is rare for her to actually post...and I sent a friendly, casual reply ""Hey hope you're having a great year,"" or something like that. I didn't expect any thing more than a thanks and she sent, ""Thanks! You too! I miss seeing you!"" Which at the time I was married and didn't want to fan the flame...so I just replied, ""I miss seeing you too, gal."" I thought the ""gal"" my prevent the conversation from moving forward while it still let her know I heard her and miss her too. TWO days later I run into her at the store with her family and her sister cat called her making her blush when we crossed paths...awkward...but telling...

I drunk added her on Snapchat sometime before then...and she started viewing ALL my snaps...and this is still going on. In fact, she's usually the first to view them. 

Last year she got a boyfriend...but the orbiting got more intense if anything...even on his birthday...even during prime ""date night"" hours of 6-11pm...she's viewing my stories...even when I know she's with him on vacations, etc, she's watching.

I even started posting ""test sequences"" on Snapchat stories where I'll do: 

\- I start with an intense picture...like a really up close selfie or a shirtless gym selfie  
\- a cryptic caption with an outdoor picture  
\- a dad moment snap

I'm trying to make her feel something and reach out...while also giving her a reason to back off and quit with the intensity...but she isn't doing either. She stays engaged...

This past year we had a few emotionally charged ""encounters"". One morning I was SUPER frustrated and was really thinking about her beyond what I normally do...I envisioned her beside me, hand in hand, not hiding, not pretending. Almost manifesting her...and no lie I walk into the freaking Walmart to get groceries and I have this feeling someone is staring at me...

I look over and THERE SHE IS in self checkout with this warm, affectionate, shocked, but almost sad look in her eyes. We didn't speak, wave, nod, nothing. Just a passing stare and it was INTENSE. We had a couple more encounters like that within the past few months, too.

I sent her a message on IG later that night because I felt so awkward and it was really casual..maybe too casual for the intensity of that moment, something like, ""Hey good seeing you today how's life treating you?"" She replied back instantly....but then when I replied...she didn't even read the message. 

At least...she didn't go back and read the message until 9 months later this January...right when I started getting more cryptic on Snapchat...

I know this is a lot and some would say I'm over analyzing. But like I said I started therapy and this is one of the main things we're discussing. He encouraged me to talk about it more and not hold it in. This is part of me doing so. 

There's lot of Youtube videos on this subject matter that will say ""She just want your attention, etc"" but those videos aren't necessarily on point I feel like with a nuanced and layered situation like this one. 

I feel like the ball is in her court and I want her to be the one to reach out next, which is why I'm not messaging her. Also she has a boyfriend...which I want to respect. I want her to be happy...but I have a feeling she's not fully happy with him if she's this invested into quickly viewing my stuff and our history. 

Let me know where you all think her head is here!

t3_1j7a671,My girlfriend (F33) and I (M38) broke up because we had different opinions on sex. Could use advice!,"After 4 months of dating, my girlfriend (F33) and I (M38) broke up because we had very different opinions on sex and marriage.  We had so many wonderful dates and seemed like we instantly connected from the beginning.  We went scuba diving, dancing, and went to a couple great concerts together.  When we weren't going out for dates, she would hang out at my place and we'd play video games or watch a movie at home.  It was loads of fun and she was great!

Many nights we'd start kissing and touching, but she would always pull away if things heated up too much.  When I asked her why, she said she felt deep religious guilt when she began having sexual feelings toward me.  This began around month 1 of the 4 month relationship.  A couple of weeks ago, I told her I was beginning to get frustrated by being aroused and not ever being able to act on it.  We had a deep discussion.

She told me that she was waiting for marriage to have sex and that she was still a virgin.  I was very surprised by this since she is 33 years old and absolutely beautiful.  I have had several other sexual partners in my past, so I was not accustomed to that.   I told her I wasn't sure I could handle it, but I was willing to try because our personalities matched so well.  I'm a person with a high sex drive (3 or 4 times per week minimum).

We went on a few more dates, which also went great.  On our last date, we began kissing again and things heated up.  Again, she pulled away and sat in a chair on the other side of the room.  We brought up the conversation again and this time, she told me she probably wouldn't be thinking about marrying me if things went well for at least another 2 years.

At 38 years old, I didn't want to wait another 2 years to have sex in a normal adult relationship.  I told her.  She cried.  We hugged it out, but ultimately decided to end it.

Did we make the correct choice in breaking up?  Should I have stayed since everything else in the relationship was great?  I'm sad and confused right now.  I've never had a girlfriend that wanted to wait to have sex with me for more than a month.",EmotionalDepiction,Mixed signals,High

Now here's where I need advice. Ever since that night, he won't stop texting me. He keeps calling me his ""guardian angel"" and saying the whole thing was a ""bonding experience.""

t3_1j5cheq,My (M22) GF (F19) has feelings for security guard (M32) she just met.,"This is a long one. I’ll do my best to break it down. 

TL;DR 19yo GF confused. Considering ending our 10 month relationship for a 32yo security guard with 2 kids she met 4 days ago. I’m invested in her family and our future. I believe in our ability to communicate and work through this. How do we proceed?

Backstory—

Gf and I have been together for 10 months. I had been single for a long time previously and we entered this relationship directly after her first serious relationship (i didn’t know at the time, but they broke up 3 weeks prior). Up till now I have been extremely happy in this relationship, it feels very mature and nontoxic. We are both introverts so we spend a lot of time at home cooking and playing games. I’m happily in love, and she claims the same. Until now, I believed that. She knows i have trauma from being cheated on several times, hence my dating hiatus before i met her, and she tries to be open and overly-communicative because of that, while i try to let her be her own person without feeling insecure. I felt like i was really healing from my past. I also know she has a history of abuse (parents,partners) so I try to be super patient and understanding of her, she thanks me for it so I assume I do a decent job. I should note that I am not a very large person, in muscle or in personality, so raising my voice or hands was never in my playbook to begin with. I was hesitant to commit to a serious relationship with her but after a few months she and her family made me feel so loved and that made me take us seriously and since then I have tried to put her first every day. she has been fairly adamant about getting married and having children since we started dating, and I’m at a point in my life/our relationship where I’m considering that as a very real future. We are again, VERY honest and open with each other. We have had difficult conversations in the past and our relationship grew stronger because of it. Segway into the issue at hand:

Issue at hand—

I just got back wednesday from a 4 day trip out of town with my roommate (23m) and it feels like all hell has broken loose in our relationship. Gf started a new job this last friday working at a vape store, closing shift, 7pm-2am. This is her second job and she normally walks to work because she lives so close, but walking home at 2am raised concerns in both of us. I made her start carrying mace for this journey. I dropped her off at work friday and told her I could pick her up or pay for an uber if she ever felt unsafe getting home, she agreed. Saturday all is well, she likes her new job a lot, and I leave for my trip that afternoon. She works again saturday night. 

Sunday morning I wake up from a bad dream about my GF confessing her love for a fictional ‘Stacy’ (this was just a dream, and i told her about it almost out of comedy because she’s never mentioned being attracted to women). 
We joke a bit and the conversation turns, we talk about how we’d feel about opening the relationship. I tell her that I wouldn’t mind her fooling around with another woman, or, potentially having a threesome (with someone we do not know in real life) with either a man or a woman because I am somewhat curious about my sexuality and she had previously expressed a fantasy about being with multiple men at once. We agreed that we would tell one another if we felt attracted to someone else. It was lighthearted and honestly got me thinking about what I might want to experience together with her. Sunday continued on as normal and she worked at the vape store again that night.

2:30am monday morning, after her sunday shift, GF calls me crying, so much i thought she was hurt or something happened on the way home. She’s nonsensical, apologizing over and over and saying she feels sick, can’t eat, can’t sleep, saying she loves me over and over. I talk her down and we both go to sleep. Monday, things are strange, she seems off. Monday night she calls me crying again, this time with more to say: she mentions how we said we would tell each other if we felt attracted to someone. then proceeds to tell me the following story:

There’s a security guard that works at the vape shop. He reminds her of someone she used to ‘like’. He is very flirty, assertive, and dominant. He met her on friday and was making light fun of her being the new girl at work. His first interaction with her was while she was on a ladder and he told her to pull her shorts down because he could see up them. Later, he asked if she had a boyfriend, she said she did, and things were normal, albeit he was still flirty. When it came time for her to walk home, everyone in the store unanimously decided that the security guard would walk her home after work to make sure she’s safe, she insisted that everyone had decided it was okay. she began feeling conflicted because she noticed she was attracted to the security guard, and the way he carries himself, she felt guilty for feeling this way but kept having thoughts of ‘something happening while they were alone’ but that she valued our relationship and didn’t want to hurt me, she mentioned she might be confused because of our previous conversation about threesomes and she wanted to be true to her word and tell me that she was having these attractions. Sunday when he walked her home after work he asked her if ‘she had a crush on him or something’ and she replied to him that it’s not a crush, she does feel sexually attracted to him but she feels guilty for it because she is in a happily committed relationship and also because he is 32 years old with 2 kids, and she is 19, and it doesn’t feel right. She told him she was going to tell me about their walks home at night. (End of her story).
I made it abundantly clear to her that I love her, I will always love her, i’m glad she told me and was honest, and i’m not mad at her for feeling attracted to someone, I said it’s only human to feel that way and what’s important is how we handle it , and that we don’t cross any boundaries to make each other uncomfortable. I made it clear that my boundary is set and I’m not comfortable with anything happening between them because I’m out of town, I’ve never met this man,and she’s only known him a few days. We decided to put a pin in it until i got back from my trip and talk more. The rest of our conversations were fairly normal during my trip.

Fast forward to wednesday night. I rolled into town from my trip and went to my GF house to pick her up. I found her sitting in her room with no lights on, silently crying to herself. After a few minutes of prying i finally got some words out of her. Essentially, she hasn’t stopped thinking about having sex with this security guard, she can’t stop thinking about it when she’s around him and she feels absolutely terrible for feeling those things because she doesn’t want to hurt me. Throughout this conversation she asked several times if i want to break up, if i want to take a break, if i want to have my own side-girlfriend, if i would be okay with her having sex with him, she even asked if I want to go down on her WITH him. 

I was confused, shocked, surprised. Now i’m here asking your advice. I made it clear to her that i do not blame her for having these thoughts about being with another man, especially after i brought up having a threesome or opening the relationship, albeit i really meant she could see other women if she wanted. I don’t even blame her for considering whether she really truly wants to spend her life with me. I understand that i’m only her second relationship and that she wonders what else is out there. I told her i don’t mind experimenting if she wants to, i.e. inviting another guy over for a threesome who is buff/older/dominant etc (because i am not those things, at least not in the typical way). I said i’m not comfortable with this security guard in particular because i haven’t met him, he’s so much older and has kids, she JUST met him , and they work together, they would see each other regularly without my presence. 
I told her i won’t hate her if she wants to break up, but that she needs to think about it and decide because she can’t have her cake and eat it to (this is something she said earlier, that she wants to have her cake and eat it to). I made it clear again that my idea of us opening the relationship would be for us to agree on something and experience it together. i.e. a threesome so she can experience multiple men. and that it would almost exclusively be with people we do not know in our day to day life. and that we both have to agree on the person. 

She stayed with me that night because she didn’t want to be alone or me to be alone. And I did something that i vowed to myself I wouldn’t do because it has only caused problems in my previous relationships. I looked though her phone, I know it was wrong of me and probably opened this can of worms even more but my curiosity got the better of me. There were lots of texts to her best friend essentially saying everything I already knew at this point, asking her advice. (Which was to be straightforward and honest with me). Her search history was full of reddit posts like ‘how do i break up with someone who has done nothing wrong?’
And most importantly there was a very long note in her notes app. 

This note detailed a lot of the things she already told me, how she met the security guard, their conversation about sexual attraction, her guilt for feeling this attraction. There was a section where she says she feels like scum because she realized she is in a perfect relationship where i treat her with so much kindness and respect, but that she’s attracted to this security guard’s assertiveness and dominance and aggression because it’s what she’s always been drawn to in a partner. She mentions being confused as to how she feels this strongly after only a few days, and wonders how she can consider leaving me for this new person. She mentions how she worries that she got into this relationship too soon after her last relationship, and how she’s never had much time to be alone and be single and figure out how to be her own person without being up under someone else’s wing. She mentions how her feelings for me have come and gone since we’ve been together, there’s been times when she wanted it to end because she doesn’t feel attraction for me, but then she would feel so in love again and want to spend her life with me. She mentions how she wants to be single and have time to be content by herself, but she knows she would regret leaving me to do that and by then the door would close and she wouldn’t be able to be with me again. She mentions how she hopes i open her notes app and read this so i can understand her thought process. she mentions how she needs to grow up and stop being immature, that she’s trying, and she is trying to not hurt me, that she won’t let herself act on these feelings behind my back because she respects me and doesn’t want to hurt me especially with my past experiences being cheated on. She mentions that she’s scared, that if we do stay together, her feelings for the security guard won’t go away. she may start feeling more than sexual attraction, she may start thinking ‘i’m starting to like you’ and then that’s where we’re really fucked (actual words from her notes). 


Final Thoughts—

What do I do. I see this woman as the mother of my unborn children, the light of my life, the rock i lean on. I know she’s confused. I’m confused too. I want to be with her. I want it to be easy for her to be with me. I want to be open to trying new things with her sexually. I also want to know that she is content with me alone, that i’m enough. I don’t want to turn our relationship into big brother or 1984 just for us to stay together, because what kind of relationship is that for either of us? I also don’t want to open our relationship entirely and end up married and not sleeping in the same bed.

Am i crazy for staying with her? Am i crazy for leaving her? Is she crazy? Thank you for reading.

Over four months, our conversations became intimate—not in a sexual way, but in the sense that we shared daily updates like a couple would. At some point, without realizing it, my feelings deepened.

Recently, she started replying more slowly due to a busy period, which made me feel distant from her. One day I couldn’t stop myself and I eventually asked if she had special feelings for me, but she said she only saw me as a brother or a friend.

Feeling rejected, I struggled to cope with my emotions. In an attempt to deal with them, I masturbated to thoughts of her, but it left me feeling angry and like a loser. Is this a normal response, and how can I better handle these feelings of rejection?

t3_1j3q5kn,"Crush at Work – Mixed Signals, No Response to My Invite… Now What? [Update]","Hey everyone,

I (28M) have had a crush on this girl (few years younger) at work for months. We work in the same office space but for **different companies,** **(we're** ***NOT*** **coworkers!)** so we don’t really interact outside of passing each other in the hallways.

Back in **November-December**, she was definitely the one initiating things. She would stare at me frequently—one time, I caught her **looking at me five times in under five minutes**. She even once came to my office door, completely unprompted, just to say, **""Happy Holidays""** before Christmas. At that point, we had **never spoken** before. Also, she barely interacts with people from my company, so this stood out even more.

Over time, I noticed **patterns**:

* **Sometimes, she’d act like I didn’t exist, then suddenly give me attention again.**
* **Some days, she’d be clearly turned toward me when in a group setting, or even at few blocs away from work** even when there was no reason to.
* **Other times, she’d lock eyes with me, look down, then look back up—classic double glance.**
* And at least once or twice, she was clearly flushed when we crossed paths.

It didn’t feel like **""just being friendly""**—there was something there. Even one of my coworkers noticed the way she looked at me.

But **despite all this, we never really talked**.

About a **month ago**, I finally decided to introduce myself. I casually asked her **what she did for work**, and she basically asked me the same back. It felt a little awkward, but after that, she **started greeting me every single day**, sometimes even before I noticed her.

A couple of weeks later, I heard through her coworkers that she had been sick for a week. So, I sent her a **quick, casual message on Teams**:

&gt;

She took **six days** to reply with a simple:

&gt;

Not cold, but definitely neutral. And at that point, it was probably obvious to her that I had a crush. I mean, **we’re on the same network but on different companies—I had to actively look for her profile,** using the informations she gave me (first name and job)

That response made me doubt everything, but **she kept initiating greetings, making eye contact, taking glances, and occasionally smiling at me**. So I figured she was at least comfortable with me.

# So, I finally shot my shot…

Last week, I decided to invite her for a casual coffee. **I sent another Teams message, worded in the least pressuring way possible**:

&gt;

I chose Teams because our workplace dynamic makes it **really difficult to talk without coworkers around**. Our two companies don’t really mix, and there's even a bit of casual rivalry between them. (I'm new at this place and I'm so over it)

# And now?

It’s been **11 days**—and she **hasn’t even opened the message.**

A week ago, I would have sworn she had seen it but just didn’t know how to respond. **Now, I’m not even sure she saw it at all.** Like, is it possible she muted our chat out of embarrassment (to not have her coworkers see this) and genuinely didn’t check?

At first, I thought she was **actively avoiding me** after the invite. But then, last Friday, just before leaving for the weekend, she casually **waved at me** in a very natural way while passing by, with a grin. It was a small gesture, but it **completely threw me off** because I was convinced she felt super awkward about the invite. Now, I don't even think she does. Like, honestly. I posted a thread like a week ago, but then I've seen here multiple times and it felt super normal, and then this was completely unexpected and doesn't make any sense. Like I wasn't even watching her or whatever when she waved at me. ***I absolutely don't get it***. I really don't !

**I need a break from thinking about this.**

# What I don’t understand:

* **If she’s not interested, why not just say ""no"" politely?** I literally gave her an easy way to decline.
* **If she is interested, why ignore the message?**
* **Could she just be avoiding it because she doesn’t know what to say?**
* **Or is it possible she never even saw it?** (Like, maybe she muted the convo out of embarrassment because she doesn't want her coworkers to see that?)
* **Or is she just not interested but too avoidant to reject me properly?**
* **Maybe she was interested by me, but has a boyfriend and now is embarrassed by this whole stuff ?**

A part of me wants to just **move on and stop overanalyzing everything**, but these **mixed signals are seriously messing with me.**

My intuition is telling me something along the lines of she has a boyfriend, was interested but now kinda embarrassed about this whole stuff? Idk, sounds like the most realistic thing to me, but that's not the point tbf.

# What now?

**Since I've sent this message, I acted just as normal with her, greeting her, slightly smiling and trying to not pay too much attention** (as I was advised to do here on reddit, which I think was a great advice)

I feel like I should probably just bring it up **in person** next time we’re alone, but I have **no idea how to approach it.**

Some ideas I’ve considered:

* **""Hey, I sent you a message last week, not sure if you saw it!""**
* **""Sorry if my invite made things weird, I really didn’t mean to put you on the spot.""** (Gives her an easy way out if she felt awkward.)
* **""No worries about my invite, it still stands if you ever want to!""** (Casual, but could feel forced.)

I just don’t want to make things uncomfortable, but the silence is making it worse. I'm trying my best to move on from this RANDOM CRUSH I had, which I know, doesn't make any sense, like I've never had a decent chat with her. I know I shouldn't lose my time with this, or even with someone who acts like this really (seems super immature to me!). But here I am, wondering ""What if"" here and there.

  
I swear I thought this avoidance was a rejection (kind of) but now I'm not sure about anything.

Would love to hear some insights. Should I address it IRL or just leave it alone? If I do bring it up, **what’s the best way to do it?**

**And also, please, girls, does it make any sense to you ?** I have legit 0 idea why someone would behave like this, lmao? But I'm not a F, so I can't really get it.

  
And yes, I posted about this a week ago, but felt like I should post some other thread since this whole week changed my view on things.

t3_1j2l4uy,Is it normal to worrying about running out of things to someone you’ve been dating? (22M) and (19F),"So me (22m) and this girl (19f) have been talking for about 3 and a bit months and been dating since mid January. We get on really well and text everyday. 

Honestly I’m not really a caller anyway but I sort of feel bad for not talking her on the phone or FaceTime but I still get anxious before I see her because I feel like this could be the time it gets awkward and I just can’t think of anything to say (hence why I’ve put off a restaurant date). 

Probably with a lot of socially anxious people… I’m like a completely different person to when I first meet someone vs people I’ve known for a while. One of the reasons I like her so much is I did feel more comfortable than i ever have done when first meeting someone (we walked and chatted for like 3-4 hours on our first date) 

I do feel comfortable around her but I just still get a little nervous. Our main shared interests are films, music, gym and Harry Potter. We also go to the same university. I do think I’m overthinking stuff before seeing her but I just can’t help it. Anyone got any tips or should I just let the silence be silent if we’re together? 

TLDR: Is it normal to run out of things with someone you’re dating",[deleted],Silence as consent,High
t3_1j0rqo5,Are these normal feelings a few months in?,"For some context, I have suspected before that I may be aro ace. But I did have a fairly big crush freshman year of college, so I know that I'm at least capable of those feelings. But I'd had no crushes before that, and none since, so I don't know if that's how crushes always feel. So most of these questions basically stem from me not knowing how feelings are supposed to feel. 

I'm now halfheartedly trying to date using OLD. I've always assumed that dating isn't for me, but I have always wanted to experience love like you read about in the books, and ofc I don't want to die alone either. I've gone on a whole lot of dates over the past year. I can almost always tell I'm not into it or can't see myself dating them, so I end it after the first date or two.

But it's a bit different with the guy I've been seeing for the last few months. We matched on Bumble in early January and have been going out once or twice a week ever since. I like him as a person, he's sweet and thoughtful and emotionally available, I do think he's attractive, and he's the kind of person who I could see myself in a relationship with. He's the kind of person I think I *want* to be in a relationship with.

But I don't know if I ""like"" him. 

We're two months in and we've not even kissed. I figure this is unusual, but I've chalked it up to us both being inexperienced. We're both 25 and neither of us has been in a relationship before. He does call our dates dates, and has been talking as if we're dating, so I don't think it's that I've been friendzoned. The thing is, I don't know if I even want to kiss him, and the thought of actually having sex with him is really not appealing. But maybe that's just because I'm nervous and inexperienced, and maybe I would want to if we worked up to it. Is that how it works? I do want to like him and I want to give this all a shot, but I don't know if I have the feelings required for that, and I don't want to lead him on.

Serious questions: Would I know by now if I wanted to kiss him? Would I know if I were actually attracted to him? How can I tell whether I'm not attracted to him or just nervous? Do I just have to let a kiss happen and see whether I like it or am disgusted?

I don't know how any of this is ""supposed"" to feel, so I'm lost. Any insight would be appreciated.",hallas2,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1iyc0ql,Should I double text? I don’t think I did/said anything wrong,"So last weekend I went on a party bus that I only knew two other people on. There was this one girl that I thought seemed really cool that I found super attractive. So when I felt like the time was right I went up to her and said Hi. That conversation was very brief. When we got to the bar I asked her if I could buy her a drink and she was down. We hung out off and on throughout the night as I didn’t want to be too clingy and weird. Then we all decided to walk over to the next bar and she was cold so I gave her my hoodie. Right then I figured that it would be a good time to get her number, just in case she takes home my hoodie. Figured it was smooth lol. While we were walking to the next bar we went ahead of everyone and I at least thought we had a very nice private conversation and that showed me how cool she really was. When we got to the next bar her ride was there so she decided to leave. Giving me my hoodie back. Which was nice. We hugged and that was it. Anyway the next day I sent her a text asking her how she was feeling after last night. We sent a few texts back and forth that day, then all of a sudden nothing. Normally I’d leave it as is but I would really like to see her again. She was different In an amazing way!!

t3_1iv4ykh,I don't know what I'm doing wrong,"Hey there, there is something I need to write down and wanna here your opinion about it.

For years I'm trying to look for a girlfriend. I'm 23 now and had one short relationship about 10 years ago, which lasted 3 months and had my first real kisses there. But I would say these were one of the best months I had in my entire life because I felt what real love means and can do with someone.

Now I'm ten years older and still hadn't a single relationship since then. But I don't know what I'm doing wrong. From time to time I approach girls, but they were not interested in me, which is fine and I accepted that. I tried to work on myself, hit the gym and so on. 

What makes me desperate is, that all my friends say to me what a good friend I am to them and how positive they feel with me around. Same with girls - I am a really respectful and empathic person which always wants the best for the person I am interacting with. Also I think I'm not the ugliest person, but ofc not the prettiest, too. Just a normal guy with a normal face, style, haircut, I am smart and can have a nice convo and all the shit. But I don't get managed to have dates or even get matches in online dating.

Last time I asked a girl out it was one of the girls from my group of friends. She came new into our group and we had nice conversations and laughed a lot. We met and talked and had a good vibe, but at the end it was as always, she liked me, but was not interested in more. 
 
On top of that, with the time I hated going out to clubs or bars, because it lets me feel even worse after I've been there, cause no one seems to be interested in me or even worse, when they look at me like I'm an alien. Trust me, its not like I'm telling you shit about me, so this is what really makes me sad. What are your thoughts?

As the relation is progressing we talked about moving together, she will move to my apartment, however I realized now that her kid is very demanding with her time and resources, she wants of course the kid to move with us, one close friend suggested about stopping all of this since I will be getting myself in a very complex situation in the future , his point is that as stepfather you will be always her second priority even more if the kid is very demanding because of his condition, you won’t have any authority over the kid behavior cause you could get in trouble with her and also if you live together as a family she will also be demanding about you supporting her with her demanding kid , my friend finally added that in normal circumstances being a stepfather isn’t easy and because of his syndrome will make it even more complex, he also added that when teenager he will be more complex to control,

t3_1injbgo,Mental health and relationships,"I dated a guy for a few months. We'd known each other for a year before we dated. He's younger, never married, no kids. I'm divorced with a 4 year old. I broke up with him rather abruptly because I felt like he was pulling away, distancing himself, and I didn't know how to deal with it so I walked away. We work together, so I'd still see him at work but I avoided him. He was surprised and hurt. Which, yeah. Eventually, we talked and I explained why I walked away. He explained why he was getting quiet (depression and dealing with childhood trauma that was never addressed until now). I realized that my feelings for him were much stronger than I understood. He realized that he needs to work on personal issues before trying to be in a relationship.

But now he comes to my office every day, multiple times a day, just to chat. We talk like we're best friends. It's cozy and he makes me smile. But, I can't get over him because he's around all the time. I tried dating other guys, but I just want him. This has been going on for months. It's like we're in a realtionship but also... not.

He keeps very quiet outside of work. Our communication is minimal, once he clocks out. But he won't leave me alone at work. He shares an office, so the only way we get to have private conversations is for him to come to my office, and he's always in my office.

A couple weeks ago, I sent a text, letting him know if he wanted to go to a movie or hang out sometime, just let me know. If not, no worries, work life will continue as normal. He never responded. But he started coming by my office even more. I told him about a remodeling project at my house and a carpenter friend who was helping me, and he started asking all sorts of questions about my friend - what's his name, how long have I known him, where did I meet him? It felt a lot like he was jealous. But I've made it clear that I'd like to spend more time with him and he never responded! How can he ignore my texts and be jealous at the same time? I don't understand.

I want to ask him to stop coming to my office. But it weirdly feels like I'd be breaking up with him again. He once told me that some days are really hard and he struggles to get through easy/mundane tasks, so he's really working on sticking to a daily routine, and I've become part of his daily routine. Like, his days are more ""normal"" when he gets to talk to me.

His constant presence at work is hurting me. But I also want to be able to be his friend. I want him to know that if his depression hits hard, he has someone to rely on. But, at what expense? Am I giving him too much? Am I being naive? What is happening???",EIS1120,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1inqpwo,I need advice if I should break up with my bf or if I’m overreacting,"I(f30) and my bf(m38) have been dating for about 4 months. He is the most amazing guy and I genuinely love him. I am currently separated from my abusive, narcissistic ex husband and trying to get a divorce from him, plus I have a history of child abuse and trauma as well. My bf treats me so much better than anyone I’ve ever been with, but something just doesn’t seem right when I think of forever. For one, I have two children from my marriage, 9 and 5. He puts my daughter, 5, over my son and just gushes over her and is kinda dismissive of my son. I should mention that both my son and I are AUDHD, so maybe it’s that? A second thing is, he treats his parents horribly. Mind you, they are horrible to him in a controlling, uptight way, and they help him out ALOT. A third thing is, he is on disability and a firefighter, he doesn’t work. I work full time as a single mom and I also was the breadwinner of my marriage, I worked and my ex stayed home. The fourth and biggest thing is, my bf also has some anxiety and depression and hates the holidays. When he gets in a mood, he shuts everyone out and doesn’t talk to anyone, ignores everyone. Sometimes it’s a couple of days before we talk again. I normally try to be understanding, but something set me off last night and I fell into a depressive hole with some dark thoughts, which threw me into a panic attack. I texted and called my bf but he never answered. I called my sister and she talked me down enough for me to fall asleep. When I got up this morning, I didn’t have any texts or anything from my bf, except a Snapchat that just said FML. Now, I don’t know if I’m overreacting or not, but I need someone that I can rely on, especially when I go through these attacks. I should not, I haven’t had an attack or depressive state like this in a year, since I fled my ex husband with our kids.

t3_1il24nt,Blindsided and broken up with,"
I’ve been visiting my aunt while looking for a job, and I met this guy through my neighbor. We had met briefly in the past, but this time, he asked me out. At first, he was super consistent, secure, and thoughtful. I had just come out of a long-term relationship, so I wasn’t looking for anything serious, but I figured I’d go with the flow. We started seeing each other casually, and for about three months, everything felt good—his actions matched his words, we had fun together, and I felt comfortable. We saw each other once or twice a week, always with plans, and it never felt like we were crossing any boundaries into something more serious.

Then, out of nowhere, he completely pulled back and ended things. The way it happened blindsided me.

The Shift

A week before he ended things, we had spent an afternoon together where we had our first real deeper conversation. We had plans to go out, but after lunch, he got sick and said he needed to drop off his Tupperware at home. I waited in the car, but eventually, I fell asleep. When he came back and saw me sleeping, he suggested we just spend the afternoon at his place instead. I took a nap, and when I woke up, we ended up talking for hours, asking each other more personal questions. It felt really natural, and I thought it was a great way to understand the person I was spending time with.

At some point, he casually asked me what I wanted to do for Valentine’s Day, and I mentioned that I might not be here but that there was a high chance I would be because I was planning to change my flight anyway. The truth is, I had family, logistical, and personal reasons for changing it. My original plan was to stay until April, but after my mom left, I felt like I needed more time here, so I pushed my flight back by just a few days. I didn’t explain all of this to him at the time—I just said I’d probably still be around. He responded very casually, like, “Yeah, no pressure. Worst case, we’ll celebrate early.” So I didn’t think anything of it.

After that, he went on a trip with his friends for the weekend, and everything seemed completely fine. He was keeping in touch, texting me, and even saying he was excited to see me when he got back. Nothing seemed off.

The Breakup

Then, as soon as he returned, he told me he had spent the weekend reflecting and that he needed to “rip the Band-Aid off” because things were getting too serious. He gave three main reasons:
	1.	He felt like things were becoming too much emotionally and that he didn’t have the capacity for anything more serious.
	2.	He thought I changed my flight for him, which made him feel pressure (even though that wasn’t true).
	3.	He assumed I wanted a relationship with him because we had spent an afternoon together talking on a deeper level.

The thing is, we had always been clear from the beginning that this was casual. I wasn’t looking for a relationship, and I had even told him that one of my fears was not being able to commit because I was leaving soon. So the idea that he thought I was suddenly pushing for something more serious just didn’t make sense. If he had just asked, “Hey, I just want to make sure we’re still on the same page since we’ve been connecting more—are we still within the boundaries we set?” I would have reassured him immediately that nothing had changed on my end. But instead of checking in, he just decided to shut everything down.

The Confusion

What made this even more confusing was a conversation we had during the night I slept over. At one point, I asked him about his past relationship, and he ended up talking about it for over an hour—how he got over it, how much he missed her at one point, and the entire process of moving on. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but as I was falling asleep, I had this gut feeling of insecurity, like… should I even be here?

Then, when he was ending things with me, he kept saying that his breakup was still fresh and that he wasn’t ready for anything new. That confused me because I had been clear that I wasn’t looking for a relationship either—I was just enjoying spending time with him. When I pointed that out, he dismissed it, asking “Well, when did that end?” almost like my experience didn’t matter as much.

It made me wonder—was he still emotionally involved with his ex? Even if he didn’t realize it? Between that conversation and the way he pulled back so abruptly, it feels like maybe he hadn’t fully processed his past relationship.

The Way He Handled It

The way he ended things felt incredibly cold. He went from being warm, affectionate, and consistent to completely emotionally numb, like he had just switched off. When I tried to express my feelings, he shut me down with phrases like “That’s your prerogative” and “Well, now you get to do all these things without me.” It felt like he had already decided how things were, and my emotions didn’t matter.

I was completely blindsided. We had plans, we had been texting the whole weekend like everything was normal, and then suddenly, he retracted all his emotions and ended things without even giving me the space to express my thoughts. It didn’t feel like a conversation—it felt like something that was just happening to me.

Looking Back

I know I can’t change the outcome, and I respect that he made a decision for himself, but I just feel like I wasn’t given any real clarity. I keep replaying everything, wondering if I missed any red flags.
	•	Was he emotionally unavailable from the start?
	•	Was he still hung up on his ex and only realizing it now?
	•	Did getting to know me on a deeper level freak him out because it made things feel too real?
	•	Was he just using me as a distraction and then panicked when it started to feel more meaningful?

I’d really appreciate any outside perspective. I just want to make sense of it so I can move forward without overanalyzing.

t3_1ii8ifk,confused on what to do next with my crush,"I(24) told my friend I had feelings for her. To keep things non specific, her response was, I've crossed her mind in a romantic way at some point but needs time to think about it but wants to stay friends for now. I told her to talk to me when she's ready. I haven't brought up anything about of us but we still have been hanging out and texting a lot. 

Late January, the topic of relationships came up and mentioned that liked her. She responded with that a possibility in the future and our conversation continued as normal. I genuinely have never felt and clicked this way with someone ever. This would be my first potential relationship. My question is, do just wait? Do I ask again how she feels about me?

t3_1ihqkgb,"Ghosted after quite literally setting up a date, the pain is incredibly real.","Good afternoon, evening,

So, as you can probably tell, I have been well and truly ghosted by someone I really, really care about. And I feel broken and utterly worthless.

A bit of a backstory. We used to work together and stayed in contact after she left to start her own business, bumped into each other on nights out, and were always flirty. We first met at my old job in 2018. She bounced between a couple of relationships during that time, but we always remained friends. We have been talking and messaging for well over two years and had a bunch of inside jokes. I always, always wanted to ask her out but thought she was way out of my league. But in the last few months we seemed get closer.

Three weeks ago, we were just messaging on Instagram, and she asked if she could come round to my place. I'm normally really, really shy around the opposite sex, but she just put me at ease. I felt so comfortable, and she seemed the same.

We ordered some pizza, watched some terrible movies, made out, and talked about life, work, and dreams—the whole lot. It was honestly the most incredible Sunday I have ever had. We agreed to meet up again and go on a proper date the following weekend. We even opened up about past trauma, being cheated on, where we were in our lives and everything just seemed to click. Honestly, I was on cloud nine. I thought I had finally met someone whose energy matched mine. She is a real diamond, the kind of girl you can imagine marrying and taking home to Mum and Dad. I honestly felt like I was flying in the days after.

After she left, I asked about going out the following weekend. We agreed on getting some Italian food and cocktails. I proposed Saturday—she responded, ""does Sunday work?.""

I agreed and asked if I should pick her up at 6 pm on Sunday and I'll book a table (I even pre-ordered some flowers to pick up on Saturday, cringe - I know).

And then...nothing.

I tried to follow up the next day asking if 6pm worked—nothing. Saturday morning, I asked if we were okay...didn't even open the message. Meanwhile, she was updating her Instagram story, viewing mine as well, but absolutely no response.

I get it if someone is not interested, and it's been two and a half weeks since she even opened a message from me, so I get it. I've been on my own a long time, and I'm starting to think that's how it will be forever at this point. I'm 28, and this is the second time this has happened to me, and it doesn’t get any easier. I'm still absolutely reeling from the last text literally being, ""How about Sunday? x.""

I sent her a final text on Sunday just saying how terrible I have been feeling and how this really doesn't seem like the kind of thing she would do without a reason—finally asking if she is okay. Still absolutely nothing. It's mental torture. I find myself trying to conjure up some excuse to text her and try and get some response but I know how futile it is. My biggest fear is coming across as clingy so I have tried to keep that in check. But to be honest, I probably already am.

I'm not sure what the purpose of this post is—it's not for sympathy or affirmation. More just a desire to be heard. Ghosting is more cruel than you could possibly imagine. Does anyone have any advice on how to try and move forward? She is the first person I have genuinely cared about in years, and this has left me petrified of it happening again.

t3_1ihypmj,how often is normal to see the person you're not yet official with?,"i (22F) consider myself a very self-aware person, and one of my flaws in dating is i'm prone to feeling dejected when the guy i like chooses to hang out with other people over me. and i don't mean i want to see him every day and he can't see anyone else; it's not that extreme. it's moreso a combination of two unknowns: 1) how often should i expect to go on dates with someone who i am seeing? 2) similarly, when is it reasonable to expect to be treated as a priority? i.e. i don't expect him to move his schedule around for date one, but what if it's been several dates?

my current situation is: i have been going on dates with someone (23M) on average once a week for 2 months. we've been going slow; we'll kiss and compliment each other, but there's not hardcore romance going on. i can't help but wonder if we would be further along in that regard if we saw each other more often than our current pace. regardless, as it stands now we haven't seen each other in a week. and he'll be hanging out with his friends all upcoming weekend, which bums me out, because i'd like to see him.

i don't know if it's too soon to be thinking these thoughts of ""damn i wish he'd make time for me"". i knew i wouldn't see him last weekend so i made other plans in order for me to be available this upcoming weekend. in other words, i'm being conscientious of my free time and how he fits into it. i do not feel he is the same way.

this is a lot of word vomit, and any insights or words of advice is appreciated. i don't know if i'm over-attached or if he's in the wrong for not giving me a bit more consideration/priority or whatever else. ",AnimatorActual7823,General dating / relationship,Low

I matched with this guy on tinder to start. (I know, I know, I deleted tinder shortly after this due to the behavior of men) We had amazing, thorough conversation, his bio was all green flags (aka looking for something more long term ish, i’m a nice guy bs, specifically said im different then all these little mustache men” or something alone those lines. no mustache included.) We had our first “date” which was supposed to be a walk, but since it was cold I ended up going to his apartment (literally I KNOW!) and we ordered takeout and watched a movie. One thing obviously led to another… and we had great sex. This led to us essentially talking all the time. For a month, he texted me sweet texts every morning, I saw him multiple times a week, always at each other’s places. We are both home bodies but it’s also winter… however I was starting to get irritated that he hadn’t taken me on a real date yet. However, this whole time, he told me he wanted to be exclusive but not official, he saw a future with me, would caress me and look at me with puppy eyes, hold me and squeeze me so tightly. So I guess I fell for it. About a month in, I got into an altercation with a friend and he almost ended things with me but heard me out and we continued. Around this time he was also thinking of possibly moving out of state for work but decided to stay… for the people he “cared about and loved” so I assumed that meant we were going to have a future together like an idiot??? He said he still wanted to “take things slow” which I figured he needed more time to be official, which I was ok with! We spoke every single day, I just lost my dog and my friend within two weeks and ended up breaking my leg as well, so life is rlly nerfing me. He knows all of this and has “been there” for me. Through all of this we were having so much sex. So much. I’m naive I think. He was texting me totally fine, and out of the blue yesterday, and sends me a text that we should go our separate ways, and he thinks i’m amazing and a great girl and he got SO close to wanting to date me but not 100%. What the FUCK does that mean. He is a coward who wasted my time and told me what I wanted to hear. We were emotionally intimate which is the most devastating. I opened up to him about how I feel that people abuse me for my kindness and love, and he did exactly that. I truly wanted something with him and wanted a future. We were supposed to go on a real date today. Why would he do this? Just to get his dick wet? I’m so hurt and confused, it came out of left field really for me. Last weekend when I saw him we had a great time and I was wondering when he’d ask me to be his girlfriend. The answer was never, HAHA. Gotta laugh about it. I am so lonely and just want to be cared about. I was celibate for months before this as well so that sucks. What do I do? How do I feel? I’m hurt and mad and sad and angry. Advice? Plz don’t rip me a new one reddit I’m having a BAD TIME. I also want to add we did things such as - shopping together, him bringing his laundry over, pedicuring his FEET!, showering together, making each other breakfast…. relationship activities.

t3_1qp9953,Guy really liked me and then ghosted me? I think.,"So, I’m a senior in high school, and this guy from my grade (let’s call him S) started to be very interested in me, he kept asking my friends if they could set him up with me and saying I was really cute and what not.

**The first time I ever interacted with him:**

I was making decorations for an event at my school and he kept showing up to help and talk to me, when we got to talking he asked me if he could sign up to attend the event and I said (which I’m 90% sure he was not planning on attending before) “sure, where do you want me to send the link to you?” And he really smoothly asked me for my Instagram. When I sent it to him, he was very insistent on keeping the conversation going and whenever the conversation was about to reach its eventual end he kept asking me “wyd?” Or “what you up to?” I was polite and did reciprocate a bit since I also thought he was kinda cute. Then the day of the event arrives and he pulls up, for some reason he seems scared of touching me? I’m not sure how to describe it but when I got close to him he was very visually nervous. Sometimes he’d glance at me and when I’d glance back at him he’d look away really quick. We sat next to each other while we were watching the speeches going on and he was leaning close to me while we talked. After it was over he asked me if I wanted to come with him and some friends for some dinner, where he was insistent on talking to me there as well. He ordered a drink and for some reason, even without asking him to, he gave me some, he kept giving it to me to take sips from, every time he drank he’d pass it to me so I’d drink some too. After we were done eating he took my stuff for me and didn’t let me have it until I was about to leave. One thing I’d like to mention is, I wasn’t planning on going to my senior prom since I wanted to get some work done, but during dinner he insisted I’d come.

**Prom**

So eventually, I said I’d come, and while I was dress shopping he asked me what I was up to and I told him and he asked me to send a picture of me in the dress, I did and then S said “that looks REALLY good on you” (keep in mind I had a navy blue dress) and then I asked him what he was wearing and he said “I think I’ll wear a navy blue shirt with a suit on” and without trying to point out how he obviously did this to match with me, I texted him “oh, haha, we’re gonna be twinning” and then he said “atleast we’ll look good standing next to eachother.” During prom he was also pretty touchy with me and was sitting really close to me, I also started talking to S’s best friend (let’s call him B) at prom and B kept asking me if I “liked S” after like a LOT of back and forth and seeing not much happening between me and S, I just sat down next to B and complained about how single I felt cause everyone at prom was making out. B replied to this with “Why don’t you make out with S?” And I said “I don’t think S is into me like that” then B nodded at me vigorously and said “He does. When I walked in on you guys during the day of the \[event\] he told me he really liked you.” Obviously this surprised me, so much in fact I didn’t realise B had already left to go ask S if he wanted to make out with me. B then comes back and says “S says he’ll do it after prom.” I got really nervous but after prom ended S just dropped me back to my hotel without saying or doing anything except for hugging me. Then a few hours later, while I was trying to sleep B messages me “When he’s nervous it’s a 50/50 whether he’ll make out or not” and then “he was really out of it today.” I texted him back saying “I don’t think S wanted to anyways, it’s alright 😭.” B replied to this with “Dude he’s literally telling me right now ‘wtf is wrong with me, why didn’t I do it.’ “ and then I got a text from S asking me “Yo, if I pull up rn will you be able to come down?” And I replied to S with “FUCK no it’s 2 am 😭” he then replied with “really wanted to see you tho 😔”

**New Years**

On New Years S had left me on delivered for quite a few hours which made me a little upset at him but it’s not like it was the end of the world. Then B messages me a reel wishing me happy new years. I shoot him a happy new years back and the suddenly, out of no where B texts me “Also S horny rn. Show up fr” and I said “If he’s that excited he can show up over here” and S promptly decided to ditch his friends at the party and drove for an hour to come hang out with me. We were talking for a good few hours about random stuff and laughing while holding eachothers hands as I laid down on his shoulder. Finally after a while we got up and he started doing this wonky slow dance with me, then he kissed me and we made out. Even when he had to go he kept telling me he needed “one final kiss” which kept turning into more. When he finally left, the minute I was walking back home B texted me saying “I heard it went well” and then informed me that S was ranting about me on call to him. Then S texted me “Hey, I had a really great time tonight, we should do that more often.”

**The days after**

So, the next day he came my place again (which, I’ll emphasise, is an hour away from his) to hang out with me and we ended up making out again, another thing I did was that I kissed him on the cheek a couple of times and Everytime I did that he kept wanting me to do more, and telling me he liked it a lot. As I was giving him a hickey he got really… excited? Like he started squeezing me tighter and breathing a lot heavier and he was really red by the end. After we were done and I needed to leave he started doing that thing where he kept asking for “one last kiss” and even while I was about to walk away he playfully pulled me by the collar of my hoodie and kissed me again. The MINUTE we separated B texted me again “good job today lmao 😭” I was so surprised he was already texting his friend about me and I asked B “what is he saying lmao?” And B told me that he said “idk what she did today but my god was it working.” And when I pressed B for more details all he told me was “I think he’s embarrassed by how much he liked it lmao” and he would not elaborate further.

**The problem**

So, I was pretty sure he was into me right? Like up until this point we had been texting literally everyday with the same reciprocation it’s not like we don’t double text each other either, he double texts all the time, we were flirting pretty aggressively, he asked me whether I was going to this concert out of nowhere and I said I might be and he said we could meet up there as well, and he asked me when I’d be free next so we can meet up again. Then suddenly, after replying to that message he vanished for a day. I was pretty upset but then B messaged me saying “Btw S’s mom took his phone away he doesn’t have it.” And then a few hours later B texted me “He asked me to tell you this” and I empathised and stopped being angry for a while, cause I’ve been in a situation like this before and I know there’s genuinely nothing you can do about it. Especially cause if he truly wanted to ghost me, why was his friend trying to keep me in the loop? I asked around his other classmates and friends and they’ve said similar things like “I haven’t talked to him in a while.” And “Yeah he’s grounded his mom caught him doing something I think.” So I genuinely did believe it.

Now it’s been a little more than a week and I’ve just been waiting for him to respond to the message I sent a week ago since I didn’t wanna seem annoying by texting him a bunch of times since I know it can make it worse especially if his mom has his phone and is gonna check it. Then suddenly I see this reel he liked, and the reel itself was only posted 2 days ago.

So, genuinely, I might be thinking he’s ghosting me? Am I overreacting or overthinking it? Or did he actually just ghost me?

TLDR: the story is important but basically, guy was super interested, actively pursued me, talked to his friends about me in a good way, made plans then suddenly stopped responding, his friends say he’s grounded but he’s liked a reel that was posted 2 days ago when he’s been grounded for a little more than a week and hasn’t responded to me.

t3_1qq5y0x,Is it a huge red flag if he refuses to delete his dating apps after we went exclusive?,"I (24F) have been seeing this guy, let's call him Chad (25M) for the last three or so months and everything has been going great. 

Last night, we finally had the big talk about being exclusive and we both agreed that we aren't seeing anyone else. I felt so relieved that I pulled out my phone and deleted my apps right there in front of him. I thought he would do the same but he just got really quiet and awkward. He told me that he wants to keep them on his phone because he works in tech and likes to keep an eye on the UI and UX design changes. He promised me that he hasn't swiped on anyone since our third date but he says deleting them feels unnecessary. I feel like if you are truly committed you shouldn't need a gateway to other options sitting in your pocket. It seems like he is keeping a foot out the door just in case things don't work out with us.

t3_1qdbpnr,"Need advice, please! =/","Hi sweet people!

I’ve been dating someone for about a month now. He seems nice and educated with me, but there’s something that bothers me a lot. Every time we go to a restaurant (we’ve been 4 times), he’s rude to the servers. I really don’t like that, because I used to work as a server and no one deserves to be treated that way.

On the other hand, he can be very sweet, kind, and caring with me. I like that side of him, but I can’t forget how rude he is with service people.

I’ve told him many times to not speak that way to servers. His response is: *“I’m sorry honey, that’s just the way I am. Some people misunderstand me, but it’s because of my face and my voice. I swear I’m not being rude.”*

I’m confused. Is this a red flag, or am I overreacting? How would you handle this situation?

t3_1q78jiu,Do I have too much standards as a man?,"26M. There is a girl I am seeing right now. We went on two dates and to be honest guys, none of  them were great to be honest. The second one was especially...weird.
She wanted to go skating with me to which I agreed to even though I am horrible in skating but I was willing to land on my bum a few times just so I can see her haha. When we arrive at the rink, she decides to leave because she saw her aunt and uncle skating on the rink. I was like what the hell...is she hiding me? Does she not feel comfortable with me with family members nearby? She chose to immediately leave with me. Maybe I am overreacting here too.


After this I took her to a very nice bar. She immediately searched for boardgames to play but I just wanted to have a fun conversation. When I was talking with her about my life stories, she only nodded without any kind of facial expression, she did not seem interested in me like I was in her. After 20 minutes of this, she took out her phone and started to show me random Tiktok videos she found funny. I mean..they were funny but aren't we on a date to converse? To build connection? To laugh about our shared stories? Apart from this, she was complaining all the time about how cold the weather was and so on which I did not like. She is 20 years old...maybe the age gap is what cases problems, and I should be more patient with her.

Am I delusional with too much standards? Or should I end things with this woman? To be honest, I don't go on many dates, maybe this is what dating is about and after only 2 dates, I should not rule out things with her. What do you think? ",TommyyBoy999,Fear of overreacting,High

t3_1q56lho,Am I wrong for feeling hurt that the guy I’m seeing is “consulting friends” to decide if I’m worth trying for?,"So basically, the sex itself wasn’t great, but what bothered me more was how he handled it and his attitude around it. During sex, there was almost no eye contact, no kissing, no checking in with me at all. It felt very disconnected like he was just going through motions instead of being present with me. He finished, I didn’t, and when I stopped things because it wasn’t working for me, there wasn’t much concern about whether I enjoyed it or not.

When I brought it up, his response was basically “that’s just how I have sex,” with no curiosity, no openness to adjusting, and no effort to understand what I need. It felt very take-it-or-leave-it, like my experience wasn’t something he was willing to work on. That’s what really bothered me not that sex wasn’t perfect, but that he didn’t seem interested in mutual effort, communication, or growth.

To me, if someone actually wants a relationship, they care about connection, feedback, and making sure both people feel good emotionally and physically. His response made it feel more like a situationship mindset than someone who’s ready to be a real partner.  Recently things became more serious and we started discussing the possibility of an actual relationship. I communicated some concerns about compatibility — mainly around communication style, effort, and intimacy. I wasn’t attacking him or calling him a bad person, just explaining what I need to feel safe and valued in a relationship and that I don’t want a “take it or leave it, this is just how I am” mindset. Instead of responding directly or reflecting on it, he told me he’s now consulting a close friend (and apparently other friends) to decide:



* whether he did anything wrong
* whether I handled things appropriately
* whether this is something he should try to repair or if we should just go separate ways





He also said he doesn’t act on emotion, only logic, and that he “lacks emotions,” so he prefers outside opinions.



I’m struggling with this because it feels less like getting advice and more like I’m being evaluated by a panel to see if I’m “worth” the effort — instead of him deciding for himself whether he wants to grow with me.



To be clear: I’m not upset that he asked for advice. I’m hurt that instead of engaging with me directly, my feelings and needs became something to analyze and debate with other people.



A part of me feels like if someone genuinely wants a relationship, they don’t need to ask multiple friends whether they should try — they just try.



Am I overreacting? Or is this a sign of emotional avoidance / lack of readiness for a relationship?

t3_1qvpgqh,Why do women enjoy hurting guys?,"Im only asking so that i can individually analyse how your brains are ticking - individually not as a whole. Lets get some opinions going


For example, I had a female friend who was in a three-year relationship. She and her partner had a child together, yet every other weekend she would visit his cousin and sleep with him. She told me about it openly and even smirked as she explained that she made them compete with each other. On one occasion, I was downstairs while the cousin’s wife was in the house as well—she was listening and crying. My friend seemed to take pleasure in hurting her. Later that night, she posted “sorry not sorry” on her Facebook wall while it was still happening. - ok so yeah this girl sounds to me like she was tring to hurt everyone - the wife, the cousin, her partner, and me. 

Example 2
Another time, she told me her car got stuck in the snow. When the people who rescued her ended up stuck too, she just drove off - didn’t care at all.

Example 3
Different girl - housemate
She was using me—borrowing money, owing me two months’ rent, plus loans I gave her for dental work. She even admitted she used to date guys just for free meals. I accepted that she was using me so I told her I just wanted to be friends, and that’s when she started trying to make me jealous—inviting me out, then showing up with another man, rubbing it in my face - trying to hurt me

Example 4
Another girl - I liked her for years. She knew it. We were staying at a friends place, kitchen was being renovated so we couldnt eat there. I spend the weekend paying for her meals. I told her when we were out that i wasnt sure if im supposed to pay for her meals or not because we were just friends -  I figured if she was a real friend then she would say no because she would care about me enough to not want to take advantage. But she didnt say no, she let me pay. So i paid for her meals. After dinner we left and went back to the house. She said we should take a soak in the hot tub when we get back. I accepted. We got back to the house, she went to her room to get changed and i heard a man orgasm from her room. Her partner wasnt there so i know it wasnt him because he was home looking after their kid. I know we were just friends but why tf wpuld she do that to me if we really were friends. If you know your friend likes you wouldnt try to keep them out of harms way? I told her told her i was desensitised to pain and she took it as a challenge. She told me she doesnt tear people apart - that was unprompted meaning that thought stemmed from her own preconceptions.

I suggested to plan closer to the end of the week so I sent a short text on Saturday asking if he's free on Thursday, that's it. I waited until yesterday evening to basically get a 'yes' :/

I already suggested to add video calls, play games over the phone, regular calls since he is busy and can't meet up. But I initiated the game call last week but that's it.... Nothing else has been mentioned of said calls not even a small date plan for next week.

He is going through a rough patch for work and I totally get that but it's not like I'm planning an extravagant date or smth. Is it wrong to want him to call, initiate and no wait for over a day to reply for a date plan...

I didn’t feel comfortable however I didn’t also want to make everything creepy. He was older so that’s why I thought he isn’t don’t much effort because he isn’t a teenager anymore and acts more mature now like only wanting to meet on official dates. He knew I have strict Parents and couldn’t stay very late outside however he still decided to meet late when planning the dates. On the dates most of our conversations were about how he thinks it’s normal to drink alcohol to go clubbing ( I told him I don’t do both ) so it felt always like he’s convincing me but never asked about deeper topics like our passion our interests our old relationships, I always felt he wants to keep most of his life privat. Whenever I talked about these stuff or asked him deeper questions, he would say it’s not the time it’s early to know about these stuff. But when it came to physical touch, he wanted to do everything by date 4 which I refused. So I felt myself used and not as important to him and felt low after few dates instead of feeling happy. After our 8th date I texted him that I want to end it now because I don’t belong in his lifestyle and I can’t normalize everything as he’s.

He’s more rational than I am I thought. Like, the other day he was sick and I offered to order him some medicine so he wouldn’t have to go out. He didn’t reply for hours, and then just said he had what he needed and turned me down. That’s when it hit me—he might still be keeping me at a distance. Maybe I was being naive, thinking that as long as we both wanted it, we could handle the real-life stuff between us… but honestly, I didn’t realize how complicated it all could be.

He’s studying math at a top uni in Europe, I’m doing law at a school in Asia. We’re both in our second year. This year, he’s planning to visit my country and meet up. I’ve got a summer internship, but I’ll try to take some time off to see him. Next year, if he graduates on time, I might fly over for his graduation. After that, he wants to take a gap year and do an internship here. (It’s not all because of me—he’s always been into my country’s culture, and it really is a great place, though I am part of the reason.) During the first half of that year, I won’t be able to see him much because I’ll be prepping for my master’s exams, but in the second half I could do an internship in his city.
Beyond that… I don’t have much planned. I’ve always wanted to get into a top-tier uni here for my master’s, and he’s not sure where he’ll do his. Even if we make it through that, after graduation there’s work—and which country do we choose? I don’t really want to stay here long-term, but law is pretty location-bound. (I speak English and Spanish, but not like a native.)

Anyway, it just dawned on me how many obstacles there really are. Honestly, I’m not sure I’m ready to give up big parts of my own future just for a “maybe” with us. What if we don’t last? Then I might have missed chances to become who I’m meant to be.

I’m still grateful for our time together. What matters most is seeing yourself clearly through being with someone else. I feel like every conflict out there is really just me wrestling with myself.

t3_1qmxuzt,Advice for how to navigate this as a gay man,"I just thought I’d post this here since I've been feeling very alone lately and like this has been gnawing inside me... I’ve been feeling for awhile now like life is so different from what I want it to be like and it’s as if every morning I wake up and wonder… Why am I living in this reality that feels like it's the opposite of my nature and feels like it lacks so much depth, empathy, and love?

One of the things I most desire is a committed loving relationship. But as a gay man I mostly only encounter guys that are constantly just wanting sex. And don’t get me wrong, I did a ton of hookups in my twenties because I felt like I was losing time looking for my dream relationship but not finding it and then just being celibate. So instead I thought let me get everything out of my system and explore and hookup and just be wild and free.

Eventually that got really old by my mid thirties. I’m back to wanting now what I always wanted deep down, a deep committed loving relationship. But what I encounter on the apps is a ton of superficiality, flakiness, it all feels like a meat catalog where people are treating others like a product you buy on Amazon and then either return it or use and discard it. I’ve made friends with gay men that I found out are in open relationships and are never satisfied enough, they always need to have more men, more sex. One of them even told me his husband was a “choice” and not really the love of his life. I just made another friend recently that when I asked him how his dating life was going and he told me he doesn’t want a relationship and he’s just into getting his kinks off on a kink app. So I went on the app he uses out of curiosity and it was filled with men wanting to be gagged and whipped and dominated and ""mummified"" and all sorts of hardcore, violent feeling stuff. I can only think of one or two gay men I know who want the kind of relationship I want but the majority are just focused on getting off.

I’m also starting to feel the pressures now of ageism. So many gay men would say things like “Oh 30 is gay death, and 40 is ancient.” So I find myself focusing so much on skin care and diet and exercise but it’s like it’s never enough… Because the reality is that aging is inevitable. And even if I look younger than my age, the apps make you always put your age so people will judge no matter what. And even if I were to look like a model or porn star just to get men to like me... That is only superficial attraction... So what would happen once I no longer have those looks? I want to be loved for all of who I am, not just my looks.

I’ve gotten to the point that I don’t know if I can keep hooking up. Maybe once in a long while just to scratch an itch but always knowing that it will never satisfy me. And I have found that having friends with benefits often leads me to developing feelings because I long for emotional intimacy.

I just don’t understand why it seems so difficult to find depth, emotional intimacy, even a bit of commitment. I’m not asking someone to marry me, just to say “You know, I like you enough to just focus on you right now.”

t3_1qmwyoj,Are these red flags??,"This guy (26) recently came into my (27F) life. It’s been nice in a sense that I like how he is an intellectual and has interests outside of his studies. Thing is, I’m starting to realize I don’t really like having conversations with him. I like talking to him but his responses always seem either overly too smart knowing fully I likely don’t understand because it’s ultra specific to his degree or he reiterates whatever science I said. Something he says he likes about me is the fun facts I give but across 2 months he has spent it either trying to debunk me or corrects me often. I’m not always right I’m not upset about being wrong, I’m upset that it seems very intentional. I talked to him about it but I can tell he is trying to hold back in order to let me say my fun facts in peace. He also tends to over analyze a lot about me and seems very clingy. The other day we saw a movie and there was a scene where a character was about to get chopped up and so I cover my eyes as one does in a horror movie and he just kept tapping and tapping my shoulder asking if I was ok. It just seemed a bit much. Another thing is my dog really likes him (she’s a puppy) so she tries to kiss him and jumps on him when we sit and he reciprocates but he always has this specific face I can’t pinpoint but it seems negative almost like irritated. So I try to calm my dog down and keep her away or at bay because hey i understand the jumping being irritating but then the moment I fully face him to see him in the face he switches back and say the exact opposite of what his face said. 

Another thing is my job is very stressful and I work a lot M-F 8-3. I leave early but it’s nonstop while I’m there. I also have a second job which is PRN so im not always doing that job. I do everything I can to make sure not to work outside of work hours but sometimes I just want 1 day to myself to reset. He sympathizes but then nonstop tries to plan something with me as though he doesn’t really understand that I need ONE day for myself. In fact he has been persistent of me going over to his place and then he expressed not knowing where we would eat or where I’d sit because he lives in a studio with minimal furniture. I just sat there like “why host? we aren’t going to be intimate anyway?” We talked about my space but it just seems like he doesn’t understand. I appreciate his eagerness to talk and get to know me but something feels really off. I like him I think he is handsome and I like how respectful he has been but I worry I’m being too critical but I also hate this sudden pressure. I’m very good at and big about communicating I like transparency in relationships. But every time I’ve tried to talk to him it’s turned into a “I want to make this work with you I’ll do anything” conversation from him instead of actual discussion or resolve. In fact per advice of my therapist I took a weekend break from the world and he insisted on hanging out the following week after work. He showed up with everything I liked then later admitted he was convinced I was going to end it so he brought everything to motivate me not to. Which it was nice but again it feels not genuine. 

I have a history of abusive relationships and I am in therapy and it’s been going well and I’ve been single for almost a year now so I also worry I’m being overly paranoid or if this IS a red flag.

t3_1qkjstm,Sudden breakup after a month of closeness — struggling to understand what happened?,"I’m trying to make sense of something that ended very abruptly and it’s been really hard on my head and heart.

I (F) was talking to a guy for a little over a month. From the beginning, things felt warm and genuine — daily conversations, emotional openness, future plans, and a lot of reassurance from his side. He even fought a few times to keep us when things felt shaky and acknowledged when he hurt me. It never felt casual or indifferent.

He’s very busy with work and upcoming exams, and I tried to be understanding of that. But recently, during an emotional conversation where my attachment and hurt became visible, something switched. Almost overnight, he became extremely cold, said he had “lost interest,” and said “I can’t be your love “ repeatedly emphasized that he would not come back or unblock me, and then blocked me everywhere.

What’s confusing is that just a day or two before, he was still present and engaged. There was no slow fading, no gradual distancing — just a hard stop. That contrast is what’s messing with me the most.

I keep wondering:

	•	Did he actually lose interest, or did he shut down because things got emotionally real?

	•	Can someone care and still walk away this decisively?

	•	Is this an avoidant attachment pattern, or am I overanalyzing to cope?

	•	How do you accept that something felt real but still wasn’t sustainable?

I’m not trying to get him back — I just want clarity so I can stop blaming myself and replaying everything. If anyone has been through something similar or has insight into sudden emotional shutdowns, I’d really appreciate hearing your perspective.

i've been going to this library 9 times now and i keep seeing this guy (enough to say we're both regulars there). we've had brief eye contact here and there, whenever one of us is within our visual fields, but no talking yet. 

imma be honest: i love the idea of our situation... its a meetcute in the making. he's okay looking, his long hair caught my eye, but nothing else is making me say ""oh god boyfriend!"". i also made a pact with myself that this 2026 ill open myself up to going on dates! 

so my thought process is like: this is an opportunity to learn about dating through an organic encounter! but im chickening out so much 😭

my current thought: if i pass by his table while leaving the library and we make eye contact, ill give a small smile. just that. 

i saw other posts saying notes may work but like ... im not THAT into him romantically... just interested enough to make a casual conversation. is the note worth it? 

ive been waiting for a moment too where we cross paths naturally but i think ill die single if i keep waiting for that HAHA

what signs do i look out for if its better to not say hi to him &amp; just abandon my plans? how will i know if he's just not that interested? 

i dont wanna cross a line too.. cuz what if i make him uncomfortable! what if he thinks im a creep when i approach him! i would DIE

t3_1qi1660,How do I (19F) get him off my back without being rude?,"I think there's a pretty obvious fine line between being flirty and being creepy. There's this guy in college who's been trying to hang out with me for weeks and he's clearly interested in me, but I'm not into him at all. The worst is that he doesn't seem to pick up any of my signs that I'm not interested.

He's not a bad dude, we are just not compatible. His whole vibe is different from what I'm attracted to, his fashion taste and personality. He wears stacked pants literally everyday that drag over his sneakers and he sags them which some girls think is cool, but definitely not my style. I'm leaning more toward guys who dress cleaner and are more reserved.

I just find it creepy when he comes on way too strong, keeps finding reasons to talk to me and I can tell he misinterprets my neutral polite responses as me being interested when I'm sincerely trying to be nice even when it's hard. I feel uncomfortable most times to the extent I avoid parts of college where I might run into him.

I don't know how to get him off my back without being rude. I once thought of grabbing some straight pants from alibaba, attaching a note ""Straight pants are nice sometimes"" to it and leaving it anonymously at his dorm or something.

t3_1qhz9op,How do you function in a healthy relationship after a very very toxic one?,"I feel ridiculous even typing this out. For years I dated men who were emotionally unavailable, inconsistent, or just straight up mean. My last boyfriend wasn't just mean, he'd also put me down constantly and every fight ended with him essentially telling me that he was doing me a favor by being with me. 

 I got used to chaos and uncertainty. 

But I recently started seeing someone new and he’s the opposite of everything I’m used to. He texts back, plans dates in advance, shows up when he says he will, and actually listens to me when I talk. Even when we do end up fighting, he doesn't yell. He calmly has a discussion with me. 

Instead of feeling safe, I’m terrified. My brain keeps waiting for him to suddenly switch up or disappear. Sometimes I catch myself pulling back or overanalyzing tiny things that don’t matter. It’s like I don’t trust peace because it feels unfamiliar.

I really like him and I don’t want to ruin something healthy just because my past messed up my expectations.

t3_1qg3anj,I [24M] am uncomfortable with my girl’s [27F] “Fling turned best friend”.,"We met a month ago and we knew each other previously but never really talked. It has been great and we do spend a lot of time together. She’s really sweet and we do get along really well. I am just coming out of a long year which drained me mentally and physically. In terms of my previous relationship and work life. Which leads me to make this post as I keep wondering if I am being stupid or there’s something I am missing.

As clearly mentioned in the title, she has this best friend from work with whom she had a “fling” with. And that it didn’t work out or they both didn’t want the same thing. He really seems to be close to her because he’s always there. I mean whenever she posts, she eats or just randomly. She told him about me but that doesn’t seem to do anything. I would understand if he was truly just a friend because I get that friendships mean more than a month long relationship. I tried to be okay with it but I just don’t like him being mentioned in our conversations. Maybe because since a long year I have had a terrible bandwidth to understand and be okay with normal things such as this. Maybe it’s something that should be concerning. I don’t want to be trouble for her or make her hate that best friend. But at the same time I don’t like this situation and can’t seem to be okay with it.

I understand there’s no particular fix to this. Either I’ll have to be okay with them being best friends or tell her that I am not comfortable with this and take a few steps back. 

He’s a typical playboy and has never dated anyone. She tells me that they just had sex but realised it’s not something they both wanted. I am okay with her being friends with her past partners but not flings. Let alone be a best friend.  

I am definitely missing some parts that I should be mentioning. I’ll clarify those things in the comments. Thank you, I hope you’re all doing well.

t3_1qfu7cy,Dating anxiety when your lives are in very different places,"I started talking to a guy (M25) who had an interest in me and we’ve been talking for about 2 weeks now with our first date being this weekend, I am only 21 and in my last year of university, I am currently taking a gap year before I go to law school just because of financial constrictions and being kicked out of home (domestic situation) last year. He is an engineer, seemingly well established in his field and is much more accomplished then I am. As ridiculous as it sounds, I am feeling nervous and insecure about this date because of things he has already accomplished in his life and career so far, and seems like he comes from a very good and caring family as well. On the outside I am someone who keeps up with appearances my big thing definitely is not looking how I feel, so I present myself in a way where you truly would not know the things I have been through, which is why I am assuming he had pursued me to begin with. 

I am beginning to have my doubts about this (I truly know it’s my own insecurity’s talking but I just can’t shake it), and feel as though once he gets to know me he will no longer be interested because of these things. I also only work several part time jobs to be able to keep up with rent and living expenses, especially because finding internships at law firms have been very hard at the moment, and I can not afford to shadow under a lawyer for free at the current moment, because of again the financial situation. It just got me thinking how women generally feel in this position? I am definitely no where near his success but I don’t want to rule this guy out just because of my own insecurities due to my current situation.

t3_1qcmxoi,I learned new info about my BFs relationship with his female best friend and now I don’t know what to think.,"I (28F) recently spent Christmas with my boyfriend’s (29M) family in his home town, he has a best friend (29F) who still lives in said home town.

I want to preface this by saying my issue isn’t (or should I say wasn’t) that he has a female friend, that I was totally fine with, until I received new information.

We’ve been dating for just over a year now and I’ve known right from the very beginning of our relationship that he had a female best friend, he was very open about that (or so I thought) and he reassured me at the time that it was platonic, that she had a type and he was not it (although now that I think about that statement more in depth, it makes it sound like him not being ‘her type’ is the only thing holding him back) they text each other  every few days, schedule calls to talk, calls which sometimes last hours, and tell each other they love each other. Again, all of which I was ok with, it would be pretty hypocritical not to be! I text my friends every other day, I don’t call them as much but that’s because we live so close (he lives far from her) and I tell my friends I love them too.

My issue now is that during my first ever meeting with this girl it came up in conversation that they first met on a date. Which he obviously neglected to tell me. I found out this information while sitting in front of this girl. I found out that they went on 2 dates before she said that she didn’t really feel *it*, to which (according to their account) my boyfriend agreed with and they decided to be friends.

Now that I know their initial meeting was in a romantic context it’s given me a lot more to think about. My main concern is that he actually does have feelings for her but agreed with her when she said she didn’t to save face, and at this point is willing to essentially settle for friendship just to keep her in his life. This worry is compounded by the fact that he didn’t tell me that they had dated despite having ample opportunity to do so.

What do you think of this whole situation? Am I totally overthinking? What do I do now?

TL;DR I found out my boyfriend dated his female best friend and didn’t tell me, now I don’t know what to think.

t3_1qfhmh2,Just recently left an abusive relationship. Should I force myself to date again? Or am I wasting his time?,"“TLDR” with details following if anyone is interested:  I just left a 3-year emotionally/psychologically abusive relationship and finally live on my own. I recently went on a date with a genuinely nice guy, but even though he’s great on paper, I feel intense dread and physical discomfort at the idea of seeing him again. I can’t tell if this is lingering trauma or a lack of attraction, but I DO know my nervous system isn’t ready for another relationship. Should I push myself to keep dating and see if the feeling fades, or listen to my gut and take this time to be alone and heal?

_______


So… some background. I (32F) just got out of a 3 year long relationship (31M) that was abusive and highly toxic. While it was not physical abuse that I experienced, it was persistent verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse. While he never “hit” me, he would push me out of his way, slam drawers and doors into me when I was standing in his way , and would physically intimidate and block me from moving freely around our apartment.  In addition, he attempted to manipulate me frequently, and would withhold affection and communication in attempts to “get” whatever he was looking for at the time. He cheated on me (electronically) early on in the relationship when I caught him exchanging explicit photos to women from his past, and detailing all of the things he wanted to do with them, while attempting to make plans to meet up with them. Inappropriate online activity via social media continued to be a pattern throughout the whole relationship. 

We had lived together for a month when I discovered the first explicit photo exchange (dated for less than a year), with a freshly signed lease. He had taken photos standing in front of the bed we slept in together every night, and in the shower that we shared. My dad died 3 days after I found this out. I never had the chance to go to him about what happened. Had I been able to, he would’ve gotten me out of that lease and encouraged me to move back home. Unfortunately I allowed myself to get roped in to staying with this man. In all, we lived together for 2.5 years. 

For about 5 months prior to me moving out, we “broke up.” We lived together and still spent time together but it was clear that there was no future in sight for us and we were essentially “playing house” until my last day there. Mentally, he was no longer my boyfriend and I believed I had detached myself emotionally from him.  I had finally experienced a revelation where I knew I deserved better and wanted better. By the end, we were sleeping in separate beds, barely spoke to each other at home, and mostly lived separate lives. 

Fast forward to last month (December). I finally got out and got my own place. It felt freeing when I finally moved out, and got settled into my first own apartment, all by myself, with no one’s help. He always made me feel like that would be unattainable for me. 


Now that I’m out, I accepted an invitation to go out on a date from a guy I knew from high school. He had reached out to me before I moved, and I asked him if we could wait until I was out of that situation. He waited for me this whole time. When the day came for the date, I honestly spent my entire day dreading it. I knew he was excited, and I was somewhat looking forward to getting back out there, but deep down I felt like I was too fresh out of my last relationship to be entertaining anybody else. 

We had fun on the date, but I felt no physical attraction to him. Occasionally, he put his hand on my lower back and it really bothered me (before my last relationship, this would not have bothered me). I was hoping he wouldn’t try to kiss me at the end of the date and I was very relieved that he didn’t. He has been persistent in attempting to make plans with me and keeps telling me how excited he is to see me again. 

We’re supposed to go out again tonight but I am once again dreading it. Even though he’s a great looking guy, and he has a lot to offer, I can’t shake the physical feeling of wanting to avoid him. It’s just a feeling in my gut that I can’t really explain. Mentally, I’d like to give him a chance and maybe it’ll help me heal from what I just spent 3 years going through. But physically, I’m not convinced it’s right. I’m confused about what I’m feeling though. I don’t know if it’s HIM that I’m having these avoidance reactions to, or if it’s just the continuing trauma from the last guy I was in a relationship with. Either way I do know for a fact that my nervous system is not ready for another relationship right now. 

Should I still follow through on our date tonight and see how I feel afterwards, or should I put a stop to this now before it’s too late? I don’t want to waste anyone’s time. From anyone who got out of an abusive relationship like I did, should I continue seeing this guy and see how it goes? Will this feeling go away with time? Or should I take comfort in this new opportunity to just be alone, at peace with my dog, in a quiet home, where I can work on myself?  ",Ok_Candidate_3707,Repeated asking,High
t3_1qdecq9,Confusing situationship...?,"I (27F) have been in a sort of situationship with my best friend (25M) for about 8 months. I will also add that I have autism, as it matters to how I read this situation.

At first, our friendship started with a lot of sexual jokes, since it's his primary form of humor. It never bothered me. However, I started noticing at some point that he shifted the focus and made me more often than not the butt of the joke. 

With time, we grew closer and started hanging out more often. Whenever we went to one of our common's friend house, he would ask me to get closer to him, encouraging me to lay my head against his shoulder. Eventually, we even started sleeping over at one another's place, in the same bed, cuddling all night. 

With this, it keeps and keeps escalating: constant touch and need to reach out to me, conversations around sexual topics keep coming back to us specifically, he asks me to call him by pet names that are clearly not platonic, and our emotional bond is very strong. 

What confuses me in all of this, is that while those behaviors seems to showcase that he does love me and that, deep down, I know he does in a way, he keeps backtracking anytime our relationship starts feeling too serious. He will jokingly say we are together, that he's my boyfriend, that we are a couple, but as soon as it feels too real, he steps back for a while, before starting all over again. He will say things like that his ""true friends"" know we are obviously not dating, even when he's aware everyone around us questions the nature of our relation to one another. 

I know that I can not force him to step fully into a relationship, but I need advices because I feel at lost, especially because to me this situationship is something that matters. I do love him and want to be with him, and I do my best to showcase it to him on a daily basis, without being too oppressive... But I'm worried sometimes that I'm just reading too much into it. That I'm hoping too much, even if he admits himself that I'm the most important person in his life... ",OpalLk,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1qcal5w,How do I approach talking to my situation-ship about him being romantic with me,"I have been talking to this guy for 2-3 months and a while ago he said that he didn’t feel a romantic connection and asked if we can stay friends, I agreed and we have stayed friends since.

Since we ended things he has been acting odd, somedays he is somewhat cold or extremely friendly with me but other days its the complete opposite, we go on late night calls til 3am, he has got me a gift unprompted, he invited me to a Spotify jam, sent me a message with ‘x’ roughly 7 times, and called me pet names like bae and sweetie.

An example of an message, I was out for coffee with a friend and I was texting the situation-ship, he asked what I was doing and I said I was out with a friend and we were catching up with life, he responded ‘hope you aren’t talking about me x’ (that was roughly the message, I can’t remember or see the message again) my friend read this message and said that it was flirting and its odd that he is doing it soon after ending things so soon.

I want to talk to him about this next time we see each other but I don’t know how to approach it, I still like him a lot and I have tried talking to other guys and move on but it hasn’t worked for me, I don’t want to hurt him, make him feel uncomfortable or lost the friendship that we have but I cant keep staying confused about what we are or stay stuck on the idea that we could possibly try again with a relationship when he has no interest in doing that.

She reminded me of my first ex, and for some reason my brain went into “save her / be there for her / support her” mode. I didn’t want to abandon her. I wanted to help her heal, guide her, be the guy who stays.

Big mistake.

This stupid cycle kept repeating: she talks to her ex, they stop, then somehow start again. Rinse and repeat. Meanwhile, we had sexual intimacy and situationships in between, but we could never actually date again. Every time I thought about us, about when we were together, I wanted it back so badly. That month was the happiest I’ve been in a long time.

But here’s the truth: I was never a choice.

I don’t even know what I did wrong. I tried so hard. I bought her things, literally forced her to let me spend my money on her. Plushies, gifts, random stuff, hoping it would keep our connection alive or make us closer.

Spoiler: it didn’t mean sh*t.

She just got more secretive. Stopped telling me about her ex. Stopped telling me about the people she was seeing. I was slowly being phased out while still being kept around.

Then last year she meets this kid online in some game. He was 17 at the time. She tells me they have this weird “mother son” bond because he didn’t have a proper mom. Yeh. Sure. I knew exactly where that was going, even though I didn’t want to believe it.

He turns 18. They start dating.

She didn’t tell me. Not a word. I found out later.

At that point I just felt stupid. Used. Replaceable. Like I was only there when she was lonely or needed attention.

I genuinely think I need therapy, ngl. I don’t know what the f**k is wrong with my life anymore. I’ve tried dating other women, and somehow it just keeps getting worse. I feel more empty every time.

I’m 22. She’s 21 now.

What the hell am I supposed to do? Why does love feel like a punishment? If anyone’s got something to say, say it straight. I don’t need sugarcoating.",tomtheromeow,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1q7y2y9,Should I keep being in an open relationship? (Should I take people's words as is or should I be clued in through their gestures?),"I'm in a long-term relationship with my boyfriend and we have decided to open our relationship because of distance. I'm seeing one other guy casually and I was upfront with him about what I'm looking for, and he seemed to be down with it. 

  
It's been a few months and everything seems great, until I told my mom about what I'm doing, and she has a different view, which is expected, honestly. I explained that I think there's nothing wrong with it because I've communicated openly and made sure everyone was ok with things. I said we're not hurting anyone, and she says, ""You're hurting both of them."" 

  
For context, my bf isn't seeing other people(work is a lot and he's not getting much luck with meeting people), but he has continuously expressed that he's happy that I'm happy, he's just a bit bummed that he's far from me and we can't live together. 

On the other hand, it seems like the other guy is catching some feelings. I didn't want to prod at it, but last time I saw him, it came up playfully and I asked if he's ok with us not actually dating. The mood seemed to change and he looked away, but he said ""yeah."" ... I knew the body language was off but I didn't wanna press it. The rest of the night still went well and he was maybe more affectionate than usual. 

  
My conundrum is that both people are saying they're okay with the arrangement of our relationships, but they're also giving off vibes that they're not ok with at least some of it, and I'm not sure if I should do something about it. I don't want to hurt them, but also I don't think I should make that decision for them, as if their words aren't enough or as if they're not capable of choosing what's best for themselves. 

Just wondering if I should stop being in an open relationship and cut off the guy who is catching feelings. I don't think my boyfriend would want to be polyamory. ",Human-Application479,General consent ambiguity,Medium
t3_1q7wxe6,Lesbian in a heterosexual rls??,"Okay so for reference I (14 F) have been with my boyfriend (14 M) for about a year and a half on and off. We recently got back together for like the sixth time (yeah ik how it sounds) in early December, in doing so I also lost one of my best friends because of it. Me and my boyfriend have always kinda had a rocky rls, we fight a lot over random stuff and he likes diagnosing himself with a bunch of disorders even professionals say he doesn’t have. I’ve recently started to realize I don’t like him; and that sounds horrible but you have to see it from my eyes. He gets mad at me for not responding (when im in school), he got actually ANGRY at the fact I struggled with SH because he said I was “attention seeking” (hello??), he has stated he LOVES arguing and to just ignore him when he starts- but when I try (and have tried) he gets even angrier and threatens to end the relationship (which he has done because of this before). I’m so scared of starting over, im still so young and have spent so long with him. I also just don’t have many people to talk to period because of family issues which made me move across the state to a town where I know no one so im just in a sticky situation overall. Now about the title, I have been out as bi/pan to a close group of friends for about two years (yay me ig) AND a reason me and him broke up (the first time) was because he decided he was MLM. It’s been a long road and we keep going back to eachother but I’ve been reminiscing on my wlw relationships and how pure they made me feel, I want that feeling back but I’m so scared to tell him or anyone that honestly.

t3_1q49ut0,Advice (Gay),"   I need advice and yes it is gay so if that’s against the rules or gets anyone upset I’m sorry. Long story but I work at an auto parts store (will keep private at where I work for obvious reasons) I’m gonna give backstory on how I’m like to see if it goes with my story. Im gay and some can tell some can’t. I have a more feminine voice but like what other typical straight guys like. Bikes, gaming, etc. Some people can tell that I’m gay without me saying and when I tell some people they are surprised. My co workers found out pretty quickly that I am. 

   Anyways I need help with a situation that i am having. I was originally working at my main store, I’m gonna call it store A and covered over at store B. When I covered at B I met this guy he’s around my age and who was really friendly to me. I brushed it off as him just being polite. He would use the assistant over at store B to get his parts but that assistant left, hence me covering over there. We talked for a bit and got to know each other. I got back to store A after covering at B and he started to use my store(A) and would always ask for me. I got promoted to assistant over at store B and transferred over there and he was glad because he lives close to that store.

A few months go by of him constantly coming in and asking for me or calling the store phone to ask if I’m there and WILL NOT DEAL WITH ANYONE ELSE and one day he comes in to get a part. He gets his part from me and it’s just kind of an awkward silence like he wanted to say something. I got called over to help someone and he said he’d talk to me later. Not 10 minutes go by and he calls the store phone and asks for me again. He seems nervous and asks if I wanted to go see a firework show with him and a couple of his friends and his dad. I said yea sure and he asked for my phone number to give me the address. I get off of work and go and it was a fun time but nothing happened.

Now a few months have passed since then and it is on a loop. He asks if I’m working, if I’m not he doesn’t go to the store. He also asks if I’m at lunch and when I’ll be back. He comes in, we talk, he gets his parts, and then he leaves. Sometimes he kind of gets close to me and “flirts” but not in an obvious way. There is always an awkward silence between our conversations like something wants to be said but isn’t. Mind you I know some things about cars but he works on them for a living and knows way more than I do so I give no insight on his problems. He still insists on only working with me.

My question is I tend to overthink a lot of things is this one of them? This might just be a case of him being friendly and I’m overthinking it but my gut tells me otherwise. I don’t know if he’s straight, might have a gf, or might just be friendly. It’s just weird that he only deals with me when people there know a lot more than me, he will text me see if I’m working and won’t come there unless I’m there, and will literally wait for me to get back from lunch to buy a part that someone else could of found for him. Sorry for this being so long and scattered but I can’t wrap my head around it. Thanks in advance for the help.",KOLTRON6,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1q1jh2s,Dating someone younger who’s very insecure — not sure if I should wait or walk away,"Hi everyone,  
I’d really appreciate some outside perspectives

I’m a 23F and I’ve been talking to a 19M for almost three months now. We genuinely like each other — this isn’t casual or meaningless. We talk every day, share personal things, and there’s definitely emotional and physical attraction on both sides

The main issue is that he struggles a lot with insecurity and self esteem, especially because of:  
• our age gap  
• his lack of dating/sexual experience  
• and comparing himself to my past relationships (I mostly dated older guys before)

One recurring pattern is that he constantly compares himself to my past partners. He worries that I’ll eventually choose someone “more my age,” and often questions why I would even be interested in him. He’s said things like, *“I don’t understand why you’d want me,”* or *“You could easily find another 23 year old guy”*  
I try to reassure him, but these conversations keep coming up, and over time it’s starting to feel emotionally draining.

What makes this confusing is that he *is* emotionally open in many ways. He doesn’t avoid deep conversations, he apologizes when he messes up, and he openly acknowledges his insecurities. So it’s not like he’s emotionally closed off or dismissive.

But he cannot seem to clearly say what direction he wants this to go.

He’ll say things like:  
• “I really like you”  
• “I’m not talking to you for no reason”  
• “I don’t want to hurt you”

Whenever I gently ask about direction (not asking him to commit immediately — just whether he sees this potentially becoming a relationship), he gets overwhelmed, apologetic, and uncertain. He says he needs time, but doesn’t know how much time or what he’s actually working toward.

That’s where I’m struggling.

I understand insecurity is something only he can work through, and I’ve tried to be patient and understanding. But over time, it’s started to feel like I’m stuck in an in-between space where:  
• he likes me  
• he doesn’t want to lose me  
• but he’s too afraid to move forward

And that’s emotionally exhausting.

I’m not asking him to be ready for marriage or anything — I just want to know whether there’s a clear intention to eventually date, or if he genuinely doesn’t know what he wants.

I care about him a lot, which is why this is hard. But I’m starting to feel like I’m putting my emotional needs on hold while he figures himself out.

So my questions are:  
• Is this just immaturity + age + insecurity that might resolve with time?  
• Or is this a situation where he likes me, but not enough (or not in the right way) to actually choose me?  
• At what point does “being patient” turn into wasting my own time?

I don’t think he’s a bad guy at all. I just don’t know if this dynamic is sustainable for me.

Would really appreciate honest opinions. Thanks!",loveydoveys2,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1q1lewp,Asked my hookup to the movies," I asked this guy I met on tinder(I know off to a bad start) we hooked up twice in once week so far. The chemistry is amazing, the jokes, banter, talking about history etc is really nice. Not to mention the sex crazy good. We've talked about how we drive each other crazy etc. so it's safe to say I kinda have a crush on him. Which's bad since we're just hooking up.

Ofc I haven't asked him the what are we thing or what his intentions are cuz I think it's too soon we only met December 15. We text a couple times a week even if we can't see each other.

Anyway I know if his intentions were to take me on date or at least to the movies he would've asked me on tinder rather than saying ""we should hang out"". But I took a chance yesterday and I asked him to go see the new avatar cuz we discussed how we like those movies last time we hung out a couple weeks ago. And he said ""for sure gonna have to be Saturday tho"".

That seems enthusiastic enough and like he's not planning on flaking but who knows. Mind you he's mentioned a ""full day of fun"", ""just me and you having fun all day"", ""need to come over this weekend to make up for lost days"" 3 times now.

So it kinda seems like he'd be down to hang out during the day rather than just at night in my bedroom. So do you think he'll flake? Is this a good sign? Should I ask him his intentions or just see how the movies go?

Also the couple times a man has taken me to the movies he always paid, and this guy has always paid for the alcohol without even so much as hinting as to us splitting the price. He even asked if I wanted to keep the rest of the beer even tho he bought it so you'd think he'd want it. Anyway I feel like he will pay but should I bring my own money just in case?

t3_1q4fhvo,Is he interested romantically or not,"Okey so i’ve (20f) been texting this guy (22m) for a month now. He’s super interested, Talks to me everyday, consistent, curious. Like all the good things.

He shuts the flirt down, or redirects the conversation to something else. But he keeps texting me, it’s making me kinda discouraged and i don’t know how to read him anymore. 

Does he not like flirting? Is he nervous? Or just not that interested?

t3_1q0hr40,Need advice to give to a guy friend,"IV got a guy friend his last relationship was a DV relationship he had to get a restraining order on her she was crazy, he started seeing another girl also from a DV relationship that's how they met in a support group.

She dose all the things to come across as a partner for him she's always wanting to see him and what not and treats him as a boyfriend. 

She is a struggling single parent and they been seeing each other for over a year she will kiss him hug him what ever say she loves him,  she dose IV seen her say it and text it but doesn't want to have sex with him or relationship.

I know he has helped her with money and she has no car now so he drives her around when she needs to get around with her son to school and appointments.

He keeps asking me why she wouldn't want to go to bed with him or relationship. Like to me she's showing all the signs she's into him she's very flirty with him as well. I know if I acted like this I want to go all the way especially after 1year of continuous support and bonding.

She's not religious and from what IV gotten out of her has had heaps of sex it's not like she's waiting for marriage or something.

t3_1pzj31g,Is it wrong to talk to multiple people early in dating if no exclusivity was discussed?,"I started talking to two people around the same time about a week ago because I’m genuinely trying to find a real connection, not just something casual.
I went on a date with one of them. It went well, but it felt pretty low-pressure — more like two people getting to know each other — and nothing exclusive was discussed.
The issue is that the other person found out about the date unintentionally. I invited him into a Discord call with friends, and he ended up seeing messages where my friends mentioned the date. He was understandably hurt, and I genuinely feel bad about that.
When we talked, I was honest and told him I wasn’t trying to hide anything and that I don’t assume exclusivity unless it’s discussed. At the same time, I understand that not everyone is comfortable knowing someone they like is also seeing other people, even early on.
I’m not trying to play anyone or keep options in a manipulative way. I’m just navigating early dating and trying to be honest, but I still feel guilty that he got hurt. I want to know if this is just a mismatch in expectations, or if I handled something poorly.

t3_1pzufww,9 Years of a text only relationship has left me broken.,"A long time ago, about 12 years, I dated a girl in college. She was great and my first real relationship. Sadly it only lasted a month. What she didn’t know when we started dating was that she was pregnant. It was her ex’s and she decided to keep her child. I was young, dumb and sad. One of my friends suggested giving her an ultimatum about keeping the baby or breaking up. It’s one of my biggest regrets. We split. It sucked. 

I was miserable. But the stress of the baby, her ex and school and life just made it impossible for me to keep being with her. It was a shitty situation made worse by a shitty move by me. 

We kept in contact. Checked in regularly. Eventually she give birth a very lovely little girl. I went out to visit her and take her and her daughter out to lunch and it was a delight to see them. I missed her. After that we still talked and I tried to get back into dating. I didn’t have any luck. A couple years later I got a job offer in another part of my country and I took it. I lived there for about 9 years and during that time I again tried dating. I had a couple of matches on plenty of fish and okcupid but it never went beyond talking on the sites. I still talked to my ex a bit and slowly over time we began talking more and more. I liked talking to her. We shared a lot of similar interests, complained about our lives, celebrated our achievements and flirted. A lot.

I developed a crush on her again and she said she also liked me. A few years ago when I was visiting home I drove out to the city she lives in and went out for lunch with her and her daughter again. It was a blast. We spent the day hanging out and I loved it. This happened a few more times over the next few years before I moved back to home town and closer to my ex. 

My new job was gonna take me about an hour outside of where I grew up, and maybe an hour and a half away from where my ex and her kid were living. I told her I wanted to see them more. She said they’d love that. After a few more hangouts and having fun together, I said we should probably have a discussion about what we wanted and where this was going. She agreed but it never happened. 

Back in June of this year we hung out for what would be the last time. We spent the day doing a fun activity with her kid and having a blast. When we got back to her place that night, she surprised me by saying she didn’t want to move to the city I was going to be working in. I told her that was fine and that I hadn’t been planning on asking her to do so. Especially since I was not living there and staying with family until I saved up a lot more money. She said she didn’t wanna do long distance, but we’d basically been dating while I lived in another province. Now that I was closer, an hour to and hour and a half drive was nothing to me. 

She told me that she just wasn’t sure about what we were doing. She’d thought she wanted it but now she wasn’t sure. She had to protect her kid. Her step dad was also not a fan of me. He didn’t like the ultimatum from years ago. He hated that I had visited home during my time living away and hadn’t come to visit her, despite her knowing that I was around. He didn’t like me and had told her he didn’t want me around. (She and her kid live with her step dad)

It felt like a punch to the gut. It came out of nowhere. We’d had a blast all day. We’d been talking for days in advance about what we’re gonna do this weekend and now…we were basically breaking up again. 

I went home, dejected. 

Now that I think about it, it must have been how she felt all those years ago and it makes me feel even worse. 

We’ve texted a handful of times, sent some reels on insta, but every time I’ve tried to bring up seeing her again she just says “we’re so busy right now but I’ll let you know when we’re free”. We still poke each other on Facebook every day but she won’t talk to me. I wished her a merry Christmas and she said the same. I said I hope our paths cross next year but got no response. 

That last day we hung out was back in June and I’ve been sad ever since. 

I recognize that this whole thing was probably not the healthiest relationship. Not dating anyone locally in favor of something that was simple and easy and basically lived through text. 

I want to move on, but I keep thinking about her. Every day. I keep thinking that maybe she found someone else. That she never really liked me to begin with. That once it became real, the logistics of making it work were impossible. Despite that I would have done what I could to be what she and her daughter needed.

t3_1pwjii4,"Why to keep dating someone ""healthy"" after a toxic relationship?","Hi everyone,

I (29F) been seeing someone (26M) for approximately 1 month now. We met on a dating app. We've met in person twice so far, 3rd date getting closer. We're getting to know each other in a very slow manner, which is totally fine for me as my last relationship was toxic (a lot of lies, hiding, looking for me for hookups after I broke up with him). I didn't talk about it yet, as the opportunity didn't appear and I didn't see the need. 

We text a lot during the day. I feel happy when he texts, we're getting along well, and even though I had to be the one pushing for the 1st date, he's being really straightforward about wanting to see me again. I can sense he's shy.

I have a hard time distinguishing excitement over a person from strong emotional attachment. With my ex, I kept checking my phone to see if he texted, and any small thing was a victory. I was constantly anxious and I had a really hard time letting him go. He still comes to my mind sometimes, but not in the ""I want to see him"" way, because I associate him with anxiety and pain, more in terms of comparisons or when I'm going through something difficult (I tend to self-sabotage and look for easy ways out).

Things are totally different with this person. We didn't kiss yet and feel slightly attracted to him but not in the same way (crazy lux)I felt with my ex. I always associated worry/anxiety with excitement over someone, and I feel nothing of that. I obviously don't like/love him, we barely actually know each other, I feel curious about him and trying to figure out our similarities and compatibility.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is how do I know if I'm actually enjoying the time I spend with him?
Because my only experience with loving someone had a lot of anxiety/worries involved. I always associated being upset with loving them. I have none of that now, it almost feels too healthy. I'm just amazed how we're actually able to hold conversation and have fun together without any drama and it is confusing.

For example if I make a funny sounds he says, ""You will be making that sound again when I'm in your bed."" or when looking at a picture of me he says, ""I just came everywhere."" And I'm scared because we are young and I don't think it's appropriate for our friendship. Though, I wouldn't be apposed to trying. But I think he wants a long-term relationship and I'm too scared for that. If I talked to him, he would be extremely upset and I'm scared wouldn't be my friend anymore. If I did have sex with him I'm worried he would want to be with me or start a sort of ""friends with benefits"" thing. To most of you, you'd probably think I should either talk to him or ignore it, but these jokes happen everyday and I really don't wanna lose this friendship. Also, I'm scared I may be pregnant from my most recent ex. He hates that ex and he loves family so if I had sex with him I could always make him think it's his kid. That is kind of fucked up though. But also, if he finds out he could be really mad and never talk to me again and I don't quite know if I'd want to live with him forever if he did believe it. He's so incredibly sweet and would be a great partner but I do really see him as a friend. If I had sex with him, I could maybe see him as more but I don't want to force myself too.

t3_1py8nfg,Asking out a shy guy,"This summer I went with a group of people to study abroad (college) in Europe and connected with this guy after almost a year of being flirty. We ended up traveling after the school trip for two weeks, essentially pretending like we were dating. He got me a very expensive birthday gift, which was so crazy because we’re both broke. He would tear up because he said he liked me so much when we would hold eye contact for a while. 

I went back to the states and he stayed for another month. While he was gone he called me almost every day and texted constantly, odd because he’s known to never call or text people back. 

We hang out once he gets back and we went for a walk in the city and he says “so we’re just friends, right?” and I reply “if that’s what you want I can work with that”

I didn’t see him again for about a month, we drunkly hook up a few times, and then one night I drunkly told him that I wanted to date him and he said he didn’t feel the same way. 

 After having essentially no contact for 3 months we hung out in the same group and he found a ripped picture from magazine I like and gave it to my friend to give to me because he said he “keeps screwing everything up” but knew I would like it. I kept noticing him staring at me in classes. We started speaking again a few weeks ago. He invited me and our good friend over and made us dinner because I told him I hadn’t had that dish before and he insisted on making it. I kind of feel like he invited my friend because he was too nervous to ask me to go alone. He’s flirty with me now and I’ve been hesitant to flirt back because I’m scared of getting hurt.

He was the first guy I dated that I can say I actually loved. He was everything that I wanted in a guy.  Once we had both had a little to drink and we were headed to bed and he started crying and said “I am scared I’m gonna hurt you. You are too good for me”. I reassured him that I was there and that I really liked him and I wasn’t going anywhere. Then he started getting distant. He stopped having me over and stopped wanting to see me. It was a big change because before he would text me if he hadn’t seen me that day and would say he was going to explode if he couldn’t come see me. Then I had a talk with him and he basically said this is something that happens, he gets avoidant and scared. I asked if he could work on it and he didn’t really answer. the next weekend was a big weekend.  it was this big ball thing that we had at our college. He didn’t even really say hi to me the whole night. I was so upset I cried most of the night and then I broke up with him. But I loved him still I didn’t want to. We spent the whole summer not talking to each other then when the school year was back we started hanging out again (mutual friends) one thing led to another and of course we are drawn to eachother because we get along super well. We started staying up super late after hangouts and just talking for hours and one time we hooked up. Then it happened almost every time after a hangout and he started sleeping over and it seems sweet. Like he’s caring more about me now than he did when we were together. He asked to read my very favorite book and the way he looks me in the eyes seems like he wants to ask if we can try again but is too scared. In the mornings he even reaches to turn off the alarm and says like “I don’t wanna leave” and keeps cuddling me. It’s really sweet and romantic and it is just freaking me out. I want to try again with him but I don’t know what to do. Should I ask him? Should I talk to him?

I'm not sure if he even likes me, I even decided to like message him about something and he told me that he wants me to be direct and ""if I have something to say I go ahead and do it"" and at the end he put a :), so I responded with something flirty and he hasn't opened that text for a couple of weeks now. The thing that's confusing me is that he keeps staring and continuing that weird serious gaze even after the text, for example the next day after that message I was walking, we made eye contact and I smiled at him but he wouldn't take his eyes off nor smile and I just noticed him subtly nod and that's it.

Anyway, so here goes 

I went on an amazing first date. Like truly amazing. Something from a film. We ended up in the shower floor laughing our arses off. We had hilarious conversations, we were fairly drunk but the chemistry was undeniable. And not in like a prefect way but like we imperfectly perfectly matched. 

Anyway throughout he date he kept saying rhis is the best first date I’ve ever had in a really excited comical way. 

Fast forward to a couple of weeks later we are watching a film where the guy charms this woman and he takes her home, he stops her during sex and very enthusiastically exclaims “this is the best first date I ever had”. We both kind of chuckled but quickly stopped ourselves more of a hmph lol sorry I hope that made sense. Anyway I think motherf\*\*\*\* did I get played. I slightly turn my head to look at him and the man is bright red.

Since our date his been worn thin, tired working a lot has gone out for a few big nights and I’m getting nothing from him. He keeps saying I am rushing and he can’t commit. What the f\*\*\* has happened here. 

Can anyone shed some light.

t3_1pprket,Who should ask for a 2. date?,"Hi everyone,
I’d appreciate some outside perspective because I’m not sure if I’m overthinking this.

I went on a really nice first date with a guy recently. Before the date we were texting for one month and found out that we have a lot in common. We have the same hobbies (which is not very common and pretty expensive, so it is quite a match that we found one another with the same interest). 

We spent a few hours together, talked a lot, laughed, and he even extended the date so we could keep walking and talking. Nothing physical beyond a hug, but the vibe felt genuinely good and natural.

After the date, he texted me the next morning and we’ve been in regular contact since then — daily messages, memes, small talk, referencing things from the date. So no ghosting, no cold replies. That said, he hasn’t suggested a second date yet.

Here’s the part that’s confusing me: I’m leaving town for two weeks (he knows this), and now there’s been no contact for the last two days. He has a very demanding job and had already mentioned being extremely busy this week. Before this, he was texting consistently after the date which was one week ago. The thing is, the texting and initiatives always come from his side. He is the one starts texting me or who asked me about a date. I never did that and I would rather wait for him to now text me instead of texting him myself. I have a really great fear of being rejected, so I usually try to hide instead of being the active part (when you ask for a date you could be rejected, if you don‘t ask for anything you can‘t be rejected, right?). 

Also I didn’t ask directly about a second date because I didn’t want to pressure anything, especially knowing I’d be gone soon. But part of me wonders: if someone is interested, wouldn’t they try to see you once more before you leave? Or at least mention meeting up after I’m back? Or should I be the one (since I am the one leaving) who should ask about a short date before my trip starts? Is it possible that he expects that? Or is he maybe confused if I am interested in him after the date? I replied to every message from him after the date and I was kind and funny just like we were before our date, so there shouldn‘t have been any signs for him that I‘m not interested any more?

So my question is:

– Do you think he is still interested (despite no contact in the last 2 days)?
- Why doesn‘t he ask for a 2. date?
- If he wouldn‘t liked the first date he would not have texted me after the date, right?

I am so confused. Because I really like this guy and for me it would be so painful if we don‘t end up in a relationship. I‘m definitly falling for him 😩",ashleygreenyy,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1pnqo8n,Guys uses pet name after first date. Red flag?,"Hello,

Looking for advice on whether I am overthinking things. I, 29 F, went on a date with a 35 M recently. He seems to be the type to give pet names pretty easily I guess. It started off with him calling me my lady, which I honestly found a bit ridiculous. This was before our first date. That was off-putting to me personally so I told him after sometime and then he asked if babe was better. I said, yeah that's better and didn't give it much thought. In retrospect, I should have probably said no pet names for now. As I ponder on it more I'm wondering if it is a red flag? We've only had 1 date and have been texting for close to 2 weeks only. Pertinent info, I'm not very experienced with dating so my judgement may be off. I've also noticed that conversations with him tend to sometimes enter into weird territory, for example:

1.	⁠We were chatting about travel stuff and he off-handedly mentioned encountering a naked parade with a female friend. He mentioned it was so embarrassing, not because it's naked, only because he and his friend had clothes on...
2.	⁠He often keeps saying this like Miss you, I want to meet you ASAP.
3.	⁠One time I was sharing something a bit personal around loneliness and feeling left out and ways to cope with it. We both mentioned how we tend to keep ourselves busy around such times. His response to that was Work, reading, watching a lot of videos, and honestly as a man, the best way to be sane is sex. He said, he usually has a very high libido and it's kinda relieving for him when he has had great sex. This I found extremely out of the blue, considering we were having a semi-deep conversation but who am I to comment on how others find relief. But I did kinda call him out on it saying that yeah it makes sense. You are pretty enthusiastic about it.. He responded with saying I'm sorry if it bothers you and maybe we should stop if this doesn't match. I couldn't tell if he was saying stop the conversation or the dating so I just responded with, ""Yeah maybe. I just had a super emotionally draining evening."" And then he basically responded with I wish I could hold you right now and give you comfort. And then there was a bunch of back and forth about how I basically had an existential crisis and I was apologizing for being a buzzkill. He responded with how he's always here for me and cares about me and is here to listen.

Need thoughts on is this too much too soon? In my opinion it feels so. Would love some neutral perspective on this.

EDIT

Right after we connected via text he unmatched me on the app stating that he deleted his account. Not sure if this could be pertinent too.",Successful_Ear_1580,Alcohol/substances,High
t3_1pmmy0u,"She rejected friendship, vanished for 5 years… now this weird chain of events. What is going on?","So this is a bit long, but I’ll try to keep it tight.

About 5 years ago, a girl I knew asked me to be in a relationship. I didn’t know her well at the time, so I suggested we stay friends first, get to know each other, and then see where it goes. She was very clear that she didn’t want that — she wanted a relationship directly. I wasn’t comfortable with that, so I said no.

After that, we stopped talking completely. No drama, no closure — just silence. We still followed each other on Instagram, but that was it. No feelings from my side then, and none later either.

Fast forward to last month. It was her birthday, and out of pure curiosity I checked her Instagram to see what she’s up to these days… only to realize she had removed me. I didn’t feel bad or emotional — just found it a bit odd. Later I found out it wasn’t random; she had removed me intentionally recently.

I mentioned this casually to my female best friend, who happens to have contact with her. My bestie asked her why she removed me.

Here’s where it starts getting strange.

She said she removed me “for no reason.”
Then she asked my bestie: “Does he have any feelings for me? If yes, tell him to message me, we can still do something.”
The very next day, she told my bestie: “Don’t tell him anything. My family is looking for a boy for arranged marriage.”
Another day later: “Please don’t tell him at all. My parents have fixed a meeting — the boy’s family is coming over, I have to meet him.”
After all this… she tells my bestie that she **cried because of me and was unhappy.

What’s eerie is that 5 years ago, when she asked me out, she used the exact same line:
“Let’s do something ASAP or my parents will find someone else.”

And I'm damm sure she was lying then and now both the times.

Nothing has changed. Same urgency. Same pressure. Same narrative.

From my perspective, I don’t have feelings for her — never really did. But I can’t wrap my head around why she’s doing all this now, after 5 years of no contact. Removing me, asking about my feelings indirectly, then shutting it down, then crying about it — all while an arranged marriage is actively happening.

Is this unresolved attachment? Regret? Emotional panic? Or some kind of subconscious mind game?

I genuinely don’t understand the psychology behind this, and that’s what’s bothering me — not her, but the pattern.

What do you guys think is actually going on here?

t3_1pj5447,"I just found out I have been cheated on by my current partner, and I don’t know how to approach this.","I’m 18 (F) and my partner is 18 (M). We haven’t been together for very long, approaching our 4 months, but in this short time we have grown very close. We are each other’s best friends.

I stay over at his house a lot, and feel apart of his family. We are constantly cracking jokes, geeking out together, and he takes care of me when I’m ill which is often as I have a health condition. This is very important to note because I can only thrive in stable, long term relationships. Break ups can be significantly damaging for me regarding my health, which is why there are other factors I have to keep in mind.

So to summarise, we’re inseparable. But, well, the worst thing could have happened. I got a call from a mutual friend that her and her boyfriend’s family friend had claimed my boyfriend had sent her explicit pictures while we were together. When I heard this, I didn’t really believe it. The girl who said it isn’t the most reliable source and is known to homewreck, so I just figured it was a stupid rumour.

Because we’re young, we don’t live together, and I figured it was urgent so I messaged him asking to talk. I told him someone had claimed he had sent said pictures, and, he responded by saying “can I be honest? It did happen but not while we were dating”. I said ok, is there any reason she would be saying it happened recently, etc. I think because I was further questioning him, he might have thought I already knew the truth, and he just folded. He just started repeatedly apologising, spam ringing me, saying he couldn’t lose me, all that jazz.

Now, it’s unclear when he actually sent the photos. It was either a month into us dating or a month ago. He said it was a month in, the girl said it was a month ago. I don’t consider either of them a reliable source.

After my previous breakup where I people-pleased my ex through the entire thing, I learnt to regain my power in vulnerable situations and immediately told him his behaviour was appalling, I was disgusted and disappointed.

Here’s where it gets kind of rough. As someone with long term health issues, and a tight bond with my boyfriend, I don’t know what to do. I told him I wouldn’t leave on a few conditions, such as he would immediately inform his parents on what he did (im very close to his family) and take accountability, I told him I wouldn’t be attending his birthday (which is this upcoming Saturday, and I’ve already poured my whole bank account jnto his family’s Christmas presents and his birthday gifts) or be seeing him in person for a good while until my mental is ok, and that I would have access to anything and everything from here on now, he’d have to be dead honest with me at all times.

But now my conscience is fighting with itself. I want to reinforce that I’m not inferring I will stay with him because of unhealthy attachment, but because his response tells me he is deeply troubled by what he did. Also got a message from his friend who lived nearby that he ran straight to his house hyperventilating. I don’t feel bad, because this is what consequences of your actions look like. But yeah, I guess I’m giving him the opportunity to redeem himself. I don’t know if this is the right thing to do, but I also know people can’t tell me what the right or wrong thing is to do in this scenario, so I guess I’m just very conflicted.

I’m also friends with my boyfriends friend and his girlfriend, who have invited me to stay at theirs (they live down the street from my boyfriend), go talk to my boyfriend about the situation, and leave and return to their house which was very kind. So I feel that can be a proactive step to take next when I’m ready.

So I’ve been talking to this guy for a while, we’ve gone into lots of personal conversations but haven’t met in person yet (finals am I right) he’s told me before that he wasn’t “emotionally available” yet we’ve become friends so I tried to stay being friends with him while seeing other people in a way but I’ve always been drawn to him.

t3_1pkzwqf,How do yall in relationships handle telling your s/o sensitive info that you friend told you to keep to yourself?,"
25f here! I currently do not have a bf. However, I’ve always been the friend that if something was told to me in confidence that I wouldn’t share it to someone else, I wouldn’t. Even to my s/o if it was a very private matter. Something like, Samantha’s dad is in the hospital due to a car accident for example is different. However it seems that I have friends that tell a lot my business to their boyfriends when I am in confidence telling my friend something about my personal life. 

I get that boyfriends / girlfriends are told things because they are your s/o but I do feel like it’s crossing a line when it’s something more private. Hell, sometimes I feel weird when I had a close friend of mine explicitly tell me she told her boyfriend that I was going on a Date with a guy and she send me a screenshot of his reaction and them talking about it.

And in the past I had a ex best friend (looking back she was so terrible) who’d also tell her boyfriend my private business that I told my bff at the time about a fight me and my ex bf had, and he even brought it up to me in person asking how that’s going / if it was resolved. I found that really inappropriate because it’s not like he’s my friend, my best friend was at the time and I was very uncomfortable. He’d also text me 1/1 when me and that ex bff had fights with each other and I wouldn’t reply to her right away. And I hated that too. That same ex bff would even say that it’s because I didn’t have a bf at the time that I don’t understand things, when our fights had absolutely nothing to do with boyfriends or relationships. He’d always be invited to every hang out we had and it was really difficult for me because I just wanted girl time with my best friend

Hey Reddit, I really need some advice because I’m feeling so confused about a guy I’ve been talking to. I’m a senior in high school, and this is going to be long, but I want to be thorough so people can really see what’s happening.

Background/History:
	•	We’ve known each other since sophomore year—we were in the same class back then. He’s liked me on and off since that time.
	•	We’ve never actually talked in person beyond brief hall interactions, even though we see each other at school frequently. He smiles at me sometimes in the halls, which makes me think he notices me, but both of us seem nervous.
	•	He’s admitted he’s socially awkward, which seems to explain some of the hesitation.
	•	I originally had him on Snapchat, then unadded him. He immediately sent me a friend request, which I ignored for months. Eventually, I accepted it again after thinking about him a lot.

Talking Stage Timeline:
	•	67 days ago, we started seriously talking on Snapchat and texting daily.
	•	28 days into talking, I admitted I liked him, and he admitted he liked me too. Around that time, I suggested hanging out, and he said he wanted to get to know me more and feel more comfortable first. He didn’t reject me, he just wanted familiarity first.
	•	About 30-40 days later, I brought up getting ice cream, which kicked off a flirty and playful conversation style that has continued.

Some key interactions showing his interest:
	•	11/21/25: I wished him luck at a game. He thanked me and joked back with me. Even when his team lost, he kept chatting with me.
	•	11/23/25: We both admitted our breaks were uneventful, so I suggested getting ice cream to fix that. He responded “Maybe maybe. Ice cream ur owed,” and we started debating who owed whom. He stayed engaged and playful throughout.
	•	11/23-11/25/25: Our ice cream conversation became a flirty game. Some examples:
	•	Me: “You + Me + Ice cream = FUN”
	•	Him: “It would be fun”
	•	Me: “Expect ice cream, me, and maybe a few surprises 😏”
	•	Him: “What are the few surprises?”
	•	Me: “Hmmm, you’ll just have to wait and see 🤷🏼‍♀️”
	•	Him: “Nooo sayyy”
	•	Me: “Secrets make it more fun 😌”
	•	Him: “Makes me more nervous 💔💔 Just saaaayyy”
	•	Me: “Aww nervous? Don’t worry we’ll have so much fun”
	•	He repeatedly tried to get me to spill the “surprise” and kept pressing me, showing persistence and playful curiosity.
	•	He teases me back, matches my energy, and admits when he’s nervous or excited. He has also called me interesting and liked that I keep things mysterious.

Current Situation:
	•	Over Thanksgiving break, I’ve been trying to set up ice cream. I suggested multiple days: today, tomorrow, and Sunday.
	•	His responses have been vague:
	•	“Maybe maybe,”
	•	“I’ll let you know,”
	•	“I’m not free Saturday,”
	•	“I don’t know what I’m doing”
	•	I know he’s active on Snapchat (his Snapscore goes up, he posts stories), but he hasn’t committed to a day.
	•	I’ve been keeping it playful and flirty, but I also don’t want to appear pushy or desperate.

My thoughts:
	•	He has clearly shown interest in many ways: consistent daily texting, flirting, smiles in the halls, remembering details about our interactions, playful persistence.
	•	I like him and don’t want to give up, but it’s frustrating that hanging out is proving difficult.
	•	I wonder if his hesitation is due to social awkwardness, nerves, or fear of commitment—or if he’s just being polite and avoiding saying no.

My questions:
	•	How do I know if he genuinely likes me but is socially awkward versus just avoiding hanging out?
	•	How should I approach this without pressuring him but also protecting my own feelings?
	•	Should I continue being playful and persistent, or step back a little and see if he initiates more concretely?

I just want honest advice and perspective. It’s exhausting trying to decode every interaction, and I don’t want to misread signs or give up on someone who actually likes me.",No-Assistant-5547,Mixed signals,High
t3_1p9pivp,Confused about a guy I matched with 9 months ago—should I stay or move on?,"



So I matched with this guy about 9 months ago. The start was normal—1–2 messages, then radio silence. Fast forward 3 months, he messages a bit during his vacation, installs Instagram, chats a little, then deactivates it. But he’s always available on WhatsApp.

He calls himself “boring,” says he studies, eats, sleeps, and stays away from girls. Yet, out of nowhere, during Diwali vac, he starts sexting 😅… and then again deactivates his IG. Now, he texts sometimes, sends cute gifs, but it feels a bit forceful.

We’ve only spoken on call 3 times and exchange 1–2 WhatsApp messages a day. He says I’m the only girl he’s talking to, but I’ve seen him hand-in-hand in pics with a female classmate around the time we started talking.

I honestly don’t know how to read him—he sounds innocent, but his actions are confusing. I want clarity because I’m serious about my relationships, but I don’t know if I should keep waiting or just move on.

t3_1paxsfr,"My single friends keep sending me screenshots of their chats asking ""What did he mean?"". So I’m building an AI to answer them.","I’m a dev and I noticed my single friends spend hours overanalyzing text messages. They constantly send screenshots to our group chat asking: ""Is this a red flag?"", ""Is he ghosting me?"", or ""How do I reply to this?"".

It got me thinking: ChatGPT is okay at this, but it doesn't remember the history of the person (it forgets that ""Mike"" is the same guy who cancelled last week).

So I’m hacking together a tool specifically for this. The idea:

1. You upload screenshots of the chat (WhatsApp/Tinder/etc.).
2. The AI analyzes the dynamic (Interest level, attachment style, red flags).
3. Crucial part: It remembers the person. So if you upload a new screenshot a week later, it warns you: ""Last week he was love-bombing, now he's distant -&gt; Classic Avoidant pattern.""

t3_1p68w59,What do I do?,"Maybe this is simple, maybe I don't understand the full picture. I (18F) have been with this guy (19M) for little over a year. Everything was fine until about a month ago when he started to act weirder. I asked and he just said he was feeling depressed. Left it at that. It then changed into him barely answering me or letting me know about updates. He would just leave me on open sometimes or even just straight up barely talk to me for a well over a few hours, no warning, no ""Hey here's an update"". I'm the kind of girl who overthinks, a lot. From what I know there isn't another girl or anything, he doesn't seem like he'd do that. Last night, he didn't answer me for a while, so I was like ""Hey are you with friends? Are you okay?"" I waited and sent ""I'm going to bed dude..."" which, looking at now, looks BAD. He just said he was tired and ""Sorry"" just like that. I apologized basically because I realalized that maybe I'm being inconsiderate. 
Here's just a list of important details to keep in mind.

- The ghosting has happened once before, I told him it bothered me and that he'd be better
- I do overthink, a lot, so this is possibly something I'm just overthinking
- He has mentioned he's been depressed and is currently trying to seek help
- I'm his first girlfriend from what I've learned. He's my second
- Yes I love him dearly after this. With all my heart

This is weird of me to ask reddit. But my main question is, where do I go from here. I want to really try and support him, but honestly idk how. Maybe i need a new hobby, which I have gotten into reading now. Thank you guys 👍

Update: He's still barely talks to me. He's says 'I love you' but it doesn't feel that way anymore. We were supposed to hangout yesterday but he canceled. He did mention he was at like an office for therapy but he's barely spoken today. I've mentioned that it doesn't feel good to be ghosted and it feels like I'M doing all the work right now.

t3_1p3dzfj,My sister hates to see me happy in a relationship,"Fuck, I (19F) hate to say this but my sister (20F) literally tries to sabotage any chance I have with any guy. 

I’ve been talking to this new guy I met on tinder a month ago and it’s literally the best thing I’ve ever had happen to me this year. He’s so sweet and thoughtful and we like each other a lot, we’re also very compatible and I can see us getting into a relationship soon. He makes me so happy to the point that I always tell my sisters about my dates whenever I hang out with him. So the day before yesterday, I was telling my other sister (17F) about my latest date with him. 

We were laughing and she was very happy for me! My older sister was in the room with us at that time. Suddenly, she opens instagram and sends him a message saying “Please spare us🙏🏻 my sister CANNOT stop talking about you PLEASE WIFE HER UP!!” And she walks over to me and shows me the messages LAUGHING!!! I get mad instantly but I couldn’t even fight her at that moment cause the embarrassment was taking over me. HE SENDS ME A SCREENSHOT later and tells me “I know I’m goated but please help your sister by talking about other people” I felt intensely mortified and couldn’t even defend myself at that moment. 

I just apologized to him and didn’t text him all day the next day. He noticed something was off and called me at night. I couldn’t pick up!! I couldn’t face him after that. So today I decided I couldn’t lose him to this and I called him around noon. I told him that my sister was acting immature and childish and I got into a fight with her. I apologized again and told him I’ll make sure this doesn’t happen again. He said he felt disrespected and didn’t like how she was also disrespecting me and violating my privacy. He said he couldn’t believe that at the age of 20 she would do something like this. 

I just froze there with tears in my eyes as he explained how weird and disgusting her behavior was. He wasn’t really angry it’s just that this made him uncomfortable. He then told me that she sent him another message after that and said “I was told I shouldn’t get involved in this. The person who warned me is the worst so be careful.” His frustration wasn’t directed at me but he just thought “how could I ever face her sister in the future after she just made the worst first impression for herself?!” 

I didn’t know what to say. He said we’ll see each other next week since he’s busy this weekend and we will probably talk about this more. He wasn’t as cheerful as he usually is. And I have this fear of abandonment gnawing at me every time I date someone. We’re not even officially dating yet and she’s trying to sabotage our relationship with her childish games. I can’t keep convincing myself that she’s a good person cause she’s not. She doesn’t wish me happiness or love. 

My friends always suspected that she might be jealous cause I’m better looking than her but I refuse to believe she could be as evil as people think she is. But now…? I kind of do… I don’t know… what should I do with this guy?! We literally like each other a lot and it’s serious!! I also can’t just cut off my sister cause we live in the same house and have the same room. I’m always there for her in anything but she’s never there for me neither in good nor bad.

t3_1p5tejf,Should I get his number?,"I'm probably overthinking and letting my shyness get in the way. But at least getting advice will stop me from overthinking like I always do hopefully.

I'll back up to last summer. My dad bought a camper from a couple, who my family still keeps in touch with. Last December, we invited them out to dinner. The couple has a son (23 y/o) and a daughter (19 y/o), though I've never met either of them. Apparently, after meeting for dinner, the wife told her son about me.

Fast forward to the spring. The couple invited my family over to their house for dinner. Again, no kids, just the couple. The wife asked if I was single, and I (20F) am. Then she started talking about her son, how he's single too and so on. Then the husband and even my dad started talking about it. It was kind of embarrassing. But I found out that both the son and I like watching hockey games. The wife said that if I ever want to go to a game, just let her know and her son would be willing to meet me. She told me that she told her son about me, and he would be willing to meet me sometime, It was pretty clear she was trying to set us up. But I didn't do anything because I didn't have the wife's number. Otherwise I might have taken her up on that offer, since I am very single and want to be in a relationship.

Fast forward to last night. My family invited the couple over, as the kids were busy. The wife didn't bring up being single again, but she did talk about her son quite a bit again. She didn't really talk about her daughter last night.

I'm considering getting his number. But I don't have the wife's number, my dad does. So I'd have to go through my dad, who, by the way, is already annoyed with me because I'm not outgoing and won't talk to guys even though I want to be in a relationship. Should I get this guys number? Or will I seem desperate since she made the offer, like, six months ago?

I've seen a few pictures of this guy (his mom showed me them), and he is really cute. But I also don't think someone as cute as he is would be into me. I don't see myself as that attractive. Like I said in the beginning, I think I'm overthinking this. Help?",[deleted],General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1p68slf,I caught feelings for my guy best friend and I’m kinda doomed,"i went to a trip with my male bestie to italy for ten days. we shared a room and a bed but it was weird, he was sleeping with his face in the other direction, he would only talk to me about plans for the next day or our itinerary, i started feeling like i came alone, he would often talk about his crushes or other female friends, but he would also often lean in a little close or once he moved a little too close to me.

He took care of me a lot, he watched my sleeping habits, kept taking care of my luggage and was very very protective of me throughout and made sure I always ate. from the minute i boarded my flight he kept saying share about your whereabouts, and when i came home even then. He stayed in constant touch with me - just like friends do.

We even fought but we sorted things out the next day. Yet he didn’t abandon me in a new city.

The thing is we are friends since last two years and the kind of bond or banter we share is too close and we talk non stop. the guy i saw in italy was not the way he is towards me. everytime i meet with him when he visits my home country he is different, very close, very warm, very sweet and lovely towards me but the guy in italy was reserved he wouldnt even talk to me or listen to him and since last two years he has been the most patient and consistent listener for me.

Once we reached back to out respective countries, he became distant. Earlier he used to reply to my tons texts with same number texts and with same energy every day but after italy he replide with three texts to my tons texts and with no energy that too two or three times a week. I asked him whats wrong? you are weird!. he said i am busy. Funny how the guy who was never busy for me for last two years was suddenly extremely busy.

The guy who used to be there and be vulnerable with me was a stranger now. So i asked him three or four times, he gave an explanation, but he was busy. what happened to him?

And then suddenly, he became active on all platforms on snapchat, whatsapp and instagram. He gave me too much attention and even flirted and teased me a little. But again, that was only for a week, post which he disappeared again.

Now he has landed in my country after three months post our trip. I was keeping a check on him during his flight but the moment he landed he disappeared again. 
He did tell me once he will be busy with a wedding once he lands but he is active on Snapchat. His score keeps increasing.

Before flying he kept saying he will see me.
I’m overthinking and creating problems for myself but I need answers and he won’t give them to me.
I can’t confess, he will run away but honestly I have caught feelings for my best friend and now I don’t think there is going back to just being friends.

t3_1p2pec2,Should I tell him I'm nuts?,"I've (53F) started talking to someone. He's (56M) nice, has a PhD and a good job, is musical and seems to be very caring and has seen some shit in life. 

The problem is that I'll be going to a partial hospitalization out of town for a month or two. I need it. I have way too much trauma to be healed with a once-a-week therapy session and still be productive in life. My past trauma keeps building up and I'm spiraling. So, the hospitalization deal is great. I'm very much looking forward to it in order to get my emotional stuff all straightened out and on the path to healing. 

So what then, if at all, do I tell this guy why I'll be out of town (800 miles away) for 2 months and not very communicative?

t3_1p2z1wg,How to get over my feelings for my best friend of 7 years,"Ive been friends with this girl for 7 years and ive liked her since I first met her, she admitted to liking me back at first but then moved me into a friend zone not long after, we had a mutual friend with us for that time too who passed 8 months ago today, and we spend time together here and there and even stay at one another’s place but when I’ve brought up my feeling for her she rejected me and didn’t see a future relationship with me, think that was the end nope multiple times I have distanced myself from her with her knowledge of me still being smitten with her and it worked occasionally for a bit but the feelings keep coming back, and every time it hurts me thinking of her being with anyone else and I get jealous and resentful, and I don’t want to treat her that way as she has no mean bone in her body and is caring and super sweet which makes it all the harder to move on, just last night I told her it was happening again and that I needed distance again but honestly I wish I could have cut her off long ago to not feel this way, but too late as we are both invested in our late friends family who treats us as their own, I miss talking to him cuz he would always help me through these phases distracting me but he’s no longer here to do so and I feel even more alone, I want to be with someone as amazing as her but she doesn’t feel the same and don’t think she ever will, honestly Im tired of the pain and suffering of these feelings for her, I just want to see her the way she sees me, to not feel any romantic feelings, but shes also my only best friend Ive got left and find it difficult in todays dating world to find someone who has her qualities and more, I’ve seen things about pursuing new hobbies focusing on new and existing relationships but I barely have the time money and energy to do anything else but rot away, and working night shifts takes most of my time away from the day as I sleep through most of it and all that comes with it, I’m rambling here but you get the point, Im just tired of seeing her that way feeling these feelings that tear me up inside and I just want to be done with it all(not suicide) though sometimes I wish an accident would happen and just take me from this fucked up world, and girls out there nowadays just want a free meal or short term fun and nothing solid, ive been on dating apps, few dates. And just fond genuine human connection hard and honestly not worth it. I cant pick up new hobbies cuz I know id drop them not long after, no money for classes or anything fun and exciting. The only options I see are to just distance myself from her but we all know that it may work for a while and the feelings fade but deep down I know they will come back stronger, this is what my 4-5th attempt to distance myself from her and its not fair to her for me to be doing this shit all the time, I just don’t know what else to do.. am I addicted to self pain or self destruction? I know in my head that I need to not feel these things and have talked it out with her as well, but my heart just sees a glimpse of hope of what could have been and wont let go, I want to let go, I want to cut her off for good but shes too kind and caring and honestly a great friend to have around keeping me grounded, but Im sick and tired of imagining her on some guys lap, or in a relationship with literally anyone else, I pray to god that he takes these feelings away and to my friend in heaven for help and guidance but it feels like nothing I do works..anyway thanks for reading all this self pity bullshit I’ve been spewing, and I’m open to suggestions even though I probably wont consider taking them",zartack,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1p1w4t2,Share my experiece of breaking up after only one month,"That Saturday, we were eating together. He said, ""I really can't imagine what I would do if we broke up. I would be so upset."" At that moment, he even wiped his tears.  
On Sunday, after visiting the art gallery, he originally didn’t plan to stay at my place but still saw me home. I didn’t want him to leave, so I cried while hugging him. He said, ""It's okay, we’ll see each other tomorrow. You’re counting down less than 24 hours now!""  

But on Monday, he suddenly said, ""I'm still very tired today. Let’s watch the movie tomorrow instead."" I said I was very upset that he suddenly changed his plans. He said, ""I really am tired, or maybe Sunday would be better."" I agreed. I remember that night he slept for a very long time, then lost contact with me the entire night. Around 3 a.m., he replied saying he just woke up.  

On Tuesday, after work, we normally exchanged messages. Then he was silent for two hours, neither asking what I was doing nor sending me anything. I didn’t know what was wrong that day — I was just very tired, lying in bed and sleeping for an hour. When I woke up, I asked what he was doing. He took twenty minutes to reply that he had just finished watching a movie online with friends. I told him I hadn’t seen him for two days and really missed him. I asked him to tell me in advance what he was doing next time. I was about to cry. He said he felt I was controlling him. Honestly, I was just really missing him and thought that if I said it that way, he would feel touched. But he only understood it as control. I felt powerless, so I went back to sleep. Later, he went for a run and sent me a selfie. That was the last selfie I received from him.  

On Wednesday morning, he emphasized that I should trust him next time and not be upset if he doesn’t reply in twenty minutes. I said I wasn’t upset about twenty minutes but two hours! He got angry, and I was angry too. I didn’t want him to keep defending himself, and he didn’t want me to keep holding onto it. I apologized with a long message at noon. Feeling awkward, I decided not to go to the running group that evening to see him, planning to meet on Friday instead. I couldn’t recall exactly how I felt at that time — I didn’t understand why I didn’t want to meet him that night. Maybe I was avoiding the problem. But we argued so fiercely then. He said he also wanted to take a few days off, and we could meet again on Sunday. I said it should be Friday, right? He said, ""Whatever makes you comfortable."" I told him I was doing that for his comfort! He said he was already feeling uncomfortable. Actually, when I said I didn’t want to meet on Wednesday and wanted to resolve everything by Friday, he understood it as the entire process being uncomfortable.  

On Thursday afternoon, I sent a message saying I was going back to school with friends for a gathering on Friday. Then I uninstalled the app. After a few hours, when I downloaded it again, the last backup message I had was from Wednesday noon. I didn’t know if he replied to me.  

On Friday, I didn’t say anything the whole day. In the evening, I told my friends I was very nervous, waiting for him to finish his martial arts class so I could see if he messaged me. He didn’t send anything. I asked what time he would come at 9:30 p.m., lying in bed, afraid to sleep, waiting for the knock on the door. At 10:30 p.m., I got angry and said if he didn’t give me my bracelet back, I would call the police! Then at 12:30 a.m., he replied that he thought I hadn’t been messaging him all day to give him space, and if I wanted, we could meet on Monday. I was really upset this time — does this mean he’s not going to spend the weekend with me? I told him that canceling the meeting without informing me was disrespectful. We broke up. He said, ""Okay.""  

On Saturday morning, I announced our breakup on Instagram Stories, telling everyone I was single. Then I kept updating throughout the day about my happy life. But inside, I was crying while walking, feeling far from happy. I kept asking friends around me what I should do, whether he would try to reconcile, and guessing what might happen on Monday. That evening, I saw that he viewed my stories. From the visitor list, I saw that his friend told him to watch, so he did.  

On Sunday, I went to an island. It was a day without signal — very relaxing but also very cold. I didn’t really want to talk to the friends I was with. His friend, under my pressure, sent me a screenshot of his Stories. He went to Shenzhen to see fountains and night scenery.  

On Monday afternoon, I messaged him asking what time we would meet that evening and if he wanted to talk. Then I went to the bathroom, drank water, packed my things, worried that if he refused to meet, I would be too upset to have the strength. His friend guessed he would meet me. However, he said that I could just leave the things at the door, and he sent me a long message expressing his feelings. Both his friends and mine told me not to wait at the door and to listen to him, to return the belongings without contact. At 7 p.m., he sent a picture — the stuff was delivered. Then he sent a long message, basically saying goodbye and how incompatible we were. I cursed him as a coward, blocked all his contact info, then called my parents, crying. I said I wanted to leave Hong Kong.  

On Tuesday, I went to work part-time on Hong Kong Island. The bustling city made me feel really good — it made me not want to leave Hong Kong. I felt that Hong Kong Island alone was enough to lift my mood.  

By Wednesday, I felt nothing — I was watching a TV series my mom recommended. The girl in the drama had a similar experience to mine. Also, it was getting cold, so I packed my clothes and changed the bedding until late at night. I bought sleeping pills, knowing I would stay up late thinking about everything. The pills help me sleep in ten minutes.

t3_1p2b51e,Am I a rebound?,"I (26F) met a guy (26M) through mutual friends at a Halloween party last year. We talked the whole night about random stuff and he walked me to my car. Nothing physical or romantic happened and he didn’t even ask me for my number. I was just starting to date after breaking up with my ex earlier that year so I was not pressed over this interaction. I just thought he was cute, fun to talk to and a gentleman.

Fast forward to next spring, early march to be exact, the same guy comes out with our mutual friends. He seemed interested but I already felt I was dating too many people at the time. However by the end of the month we saw each other again and he asked me out. I agreed and we went out and had a great time. He told me him and his ex were “tying up loose ends” when we initially met at Halloween and that he was going to be moving, so he didn’t want to waste my time but still wanted to get to know me because he thought I was super intriguing and attractive. After receiving a lot of pressure from the people I was dating at the time, I liked the idea of us just being friends and getting to know each other until he moved. We went on some great dates and eventually were intimate (per my request). 2 1/2 months later he moved and I thought things would be over but he wanted to keep things going. 2 months after that he took me on a trip to the mountains and I started seriously falling for him. Since then, we’ve been talking every day and now we have two trips planned to see each other again, including one to CDMX for NYE.

Last night I went out with a friend who is very close to his ex. She gave me a little perspective on their relationship. When I told him, he called me to discuss (nothing alarming) but I got a better timeline on his relationship with his ex and it concerns me. They were together for 2 years, broke up for 6 months (and he had a situationship) and then they got back together for 4 months, just to ultimately break up due to constant arguments and him accepting a job in another state. They broke up a month and a half before our first date… they haven’t said a word to each other since then but I can’t help feeling like I’m the rebound here, considering the short turnaround time in relationships.

He cheated, I stayed. 
He said vile things about in conversation with his friend. 
He went on to start watching corn 
He goes and gets drunk every weekend and leaves me in the shared apartment for a 6 hours + without communicating much. 
Me on the other hand, I am not claiming to me perfect. I am dependent on him because I moved 2hours away from home and the closest relative or friend I have is a little over an hour away. 

He is unemployed for the last two months and I've has to carry the burden of both of us + somehow fund his drinking(unknowingly). He guiltrips me when I dont want to give him anything money related for booze. I come back from work at around 4pm after leaving at 6am. He just sits around waiting for me and when I asked him to help out abit he did but also started demanding that I should also do stuff when I come back from work. I have started doing the little things such as mopping the house and cooking every now and again. But I get home EXHAUSTED every day, yet I have to do all these things. He spends his days applying for maybe 3 jobs and watching series and movies.

I keep crying even had a panic attack because of him.

Me and A didn't click right away when we were finally properly introduced but he tried his best to tolerate me as he cared for my then boyfriend and his happiness. 

Alot of times A would give me a ride home from band events, let me vent, random little hugs, he was kind to me. Eventually, he heard through some friends that I liked him even after I helped him get with his crush and alot of people took it personally so I stepped back and him and his girlfriend did the same.

Me and my boyfriend from then broke up and the friend group kinda faded out pretty fast after everyone started graduating. I never really forgot about A and thought of him often. Before my junior year began I decided to reach out and see how things went. 

He started picking me up from my house often, inviting me to family events, and it was a genuine friendship for a little while. I caught feelings extra fast again and confessed. That would usually end up getting me ghosted for months at a time. 

I got used to this cycle. He'd pop back up one day and we'd hang out, feelings come back, hed ghost me, repeat. I know it's ""toxic"" but I genuinely don't think he means to be.

Here's where it gets juicy. So for the last 6 or so years A has had a crush on K. The way I have had a crush on him, intense. So for almost 2 years Im encouraging this guy to shoot his shot while pining over him constantly. Not healthy. One day she rejects his offer to a date and A asks to hang out with me to vent and feel better. I was also pretty sad that day. 

So we're driving around in his car and it turns into both us talking about love and heavy things and how painful it is. We're crying, it's dull, it sucks. I confess my feelings again and he tells me he always wondered about the ""what ifs"" and where his life would be of he did date me. He sort of abruptly pulls into a gas station and goes inside for almost 20 minutes. He comes back out acting a little stiff and awkward and he tells me he thinks he should take me home. I agree. 

We get to my house and I apologized to him for being like this again and he pulls out his phone and says ""here. Read this and get out of my car"" jokingly but also nervously. My phone buzzes and I look at it. He had written a message while in the gas station asking if I'd want to make out with him for ""closure""  looking back it totally seems like manipulation especially when he paired it with words like ""you don't have to do this. I don't want to mess you up"" and honestly I should have taken that warning. But I also dont regret it exactly. 

The next 3 hours we quietly and awkwardly made out. It was soul crushing in the most beautiful way for me. I was so in love. He told me it meant nothing, and I know that. But i still held and still do hold hope that it might have meant something more to him. After that he ghosted me for a while again. No warning, just poof, gone. 

This was the first time anything romantic had actually happened between us so I was super confused.

A few months later he reaches out again and takes me to the top of this beautiful mountain to star gaze and look at the city lights. And we watched the sun rise in the morning. The whole time he was using that really flirty tone. You know what im talking about. 

It started with ""whats on your mind"" and I answered ""nothing"" hes leaning back in his driver's seat with his hands behind his head, giving me a tired, flirty look. He asked me why I wasn't sharing what I was thinking about and I said ""cuz you're judgey"" without really thinking, I just didn't want to talk to him about what was on my mind. This boy leans forward and goes ""oh really? And why's that?~"" And I just ignored him before i stepped out of the car for a moment and didn't talk much the rest of the night. 

He ghosted me for a few weeks after that night because I wrote a poem about it and put it on my social media. He gathered it was about that night and called it ""weird"" despite him saying he loved my poetry, even the stuff about him, in the past.

When he finally came back he was just as obsessed with K as I was with him again. So for the next while I push him to go for her like usual. 

For the last few months it's pretty much been like that until he suddenly didn't like K anymore. Like at all. He liked another recently girl and for the last week or 2 I've told him to shoot his shot with her.

Now this is where it gets a tricky.

New girl he likes, we'll call C, rejects him. So A buys me and him some ice-cream and for the first time ever he invites me to his house personally. I've been there before but only invited by his family to family events. Gone over once or twice with other friends too but never just me and him. 

He takes me to his down stairs recording/studio type room as he does music, makes us a place to sit on the floor, closes the door, and puts on a show to watch. Its a musical so we were laughing and singing and eating our ice-cream when he suddenly gets super sad. So I drop everything and ask if he'd like a hug and he said he did. So I'm hugging him and he's being a little stiff. I ask what's wrong and he said he's not used to people caring for him let alone hugging him. Which I beileve to be true as his family isn't super affectionate nor are his friends. He considers me his best friend because im the only one he talks to about his actual personal life and problems.

Anyway I kept hugging him and my leg accidentally started falling on him because of the way I was sitting and  i apologized and tried to fix my position. He asks me to keep hugging him and says he doesn't care if I fall on him. So I do and I lean my leg on his and he sighs and snuggles his face into my arm. I know he probably just needed comfort but it felt like ""more"" too if that makes sense? It was just alot for me to handle. The moment felt so right, the feelings were there, there was tension, i felt as if i coukd kiss him and hed just melt into it. But wrong damn moment. And I felt so guilty for even thinking about kissing him in a moment of him being vulnerable.

In the sad moment I was reminded that he's a big compliment fisher. He's crying over C while telling me ""I wish someone liked me for me. Am I that ugly? I'll die alone"" and he knows it aches me. He has to. He knows how violently I've loved him for years. It took everything in me not to break down and confess my love once again. Even if it got me another kiss, I couldn't.

Later we layed on the floor and talked and laughed and anytime he saw me not smiling he'd say something stupid to make me laugh and I'd do the same to him. Eventually we get into a game where we're throwing a jacket and a big teddy bear at eachother and im laughing to the point I can't breathe, on my knees, on the floor. He just quietly giggles, looking down at me, and keeps throwing the jacket back at me before I give up. It felt so teasey and playful. 

The last time we hung out, just last night, we just drove around. We listened to music and sang and cried. I looked at him alot just to see what he'd do and he'd get this little smile and would glance back at me when I looked away. It felt really nice. But i feel as if maybe that was coicidence, even if it happed multiple times. He bought us drinks and he got a blue drink and i got red. A soda he typically doesn't drink much, same brand as mine. Typing it out now I don't think it was on purpose, just coincidence. The sodas atleast. But the whole night anytime i was sad he made me laugh and he just acted alot more comfortable with me. He touched my arm atleast over 10 times by ""accident"" when there was plenty of space for him to not bump my arm. And when I leaned close to him to look at something he didn't move at all. He leaned close to me while singing and made alot of eye contact for alot of our hangout. 

I'm just confused. It feels like he's been leading me on for years. Im not cutting him off, I can't. I'd ask for advice to get over him but that's never going to happen. I just want to know if he's doing this on purpose or if he genuinely doesn't think i like him anymore. I also feel like right now he might only want any romantic attention from me because I'm available and he just got rejected. 

And some may get the impression he's a douchey guy. He's not. He comes from a well off family but he goes to church, dresses nice, has many friends who love him, speaks respectfully, is very polite, over all and amazing person when you take away the mixed signals and emotions.



Other small ""flirty"" things he's done:

Him and his family threw me my 17th birthday party that was just me, A, his parents, and my bff.

He learned one of my favorite songs and sent a video of him playing it and then sending the same song like 2 years later because he remembered how much I loved it and he wanted to sing me a better version.

Learned a whole random love song from a show we both liked and sent me the video saying ""I learned all the lyrics to make you happy because this song makes me happy""  

Idk If this counts but he makes quite alot of sexual jokes that I know he wouldn't make around most friends. 

Made me as an extremely ugly mii (lol)

He constantly teases and bullies me which just feels super flirty in general. 

But I don't know. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I will be updating if this gets enough attention/too many questions to answer separately / or missing details.

t3_1owguh8,Just started seeing an amazing guy… he admitted he has a porn addiction. He wants to change I need advice,"I've met somebody recently and things were going so well that I actually let myself think, ""Wow… this could be something real.""

A few nights ago, he opened up to me about something very personal: the fact that he has a porn addiction. He said it's something he's struggled with for years, and it has affected his relationships and his self-esteem.

I appreciated how honest he was. He didn't try to downplay it or blame anybody. He just told me straight up because he didn't want to start something with me, hiding something that big.

And the truth is… I care about him. I am not judging him for this. I actually respect that he's self-aware enough to admit it. He also said he wants to work on it not because I asked him to, but because he's tired of feeling controlled by it.

My question is:

How do I support someone who's trying to break a porn addiction without becoming responsible for their recovery?

I want to be there for him, but at the same time, I don't want to fall into a dynamic where I am his therapist, or where everything is about his struggle. For anyone who has been in a relationship where one partner was trying to overcome an addiction to pornography, how did you keep the relationship healthy while supporting them?

The first one lasted 4 years. He was 2 years older thank me and didn't wanted to work because his mother would send him money every month. Both used to say it was my obligation as his girlfriend to clean his apartment and do his laundry. His house was n4sty. He used to like half n4k3d girls pictures on instagram and keep screenshots of them. Once I found a conversation where he was saying that he j3rk3d 0ff to a picture of a girl he had h00k3d up before and when I when I confronted him, he left bruises on my arms (he grabbed my arms really hard, pushed me several times and throwed things at me for finding out and blamed it on me), so and we broke up.  

The second one lasted 5 months, it was long distance. We are the same age. He told me that his 2 ex-girlfriends did him a lot of h4rm. Yet, he would talk about them all the time, like, when I say I like something he says that he got that for them as a present or say that he already did (something I asked him to do) for his ex but wouldn't do it for me. Also, he still had their number and liked their stuff on social media and that's the reason we broke up.

I was really lonely over the summer and traumatized from a situation in which someone help their suicidal thoughts/actions above my head for 7 months until I finally broke contact with them right before getting tg with my ex. My ex was really sweet, but I worried about having to take care of another person and just didn't feel ready to be in a relationship right after what had happened to me. I broke up with him while he was accross the country for a month long program at a college (i would've done it when he came back if it wasn't his birthday immediately after). I told him I thought he was a bit insensitive to my trauma at times and just said things that made me feel off. Now looking back at it, I feel like a real asshole for breaking up with him when I did and that I trauma dumped on him then got upset when he didn't handle it well. I was doing the exact same thing that I went through for 7 months and was shocked when I got a normal reaction from a teenage boy. Now, I feel much moved on from my past trauma and not that I immediately want my ex back (or even think its possible), I just miss him. I miss talking, hanging out, even just being normal around eachother.

Not saying I expect to be his only thought or prioritiy just if it really came down to it he'd always choose them first. Some examples, we're hanging out plan a little stay in date night and he'll curb the whole night to grab a smoke and chat with his buddy.

Or we have a really nice date night out, I'm talking dressed to the nines $300 dinner and a show and he'll still stop at his buddies for a smoke and chat.

Or we're cuddled up and his friends come over and chat it up while I'm pants less under the blankets.

Or how we'll have plans weeks in advance but he ends up staying up all night with his buddies then continuing to hang with them next day and tell me he's not feeling the plans we had and we can just watch a movie instead.

Or talk about this super fun plan he has with his buddies with me making it seem like I'm invited but last minute says something about me going home so he can go and he's friends are the ones jumping in extending the invitation.

I know the relationship is new but I've told him a few times/all the times I've dealt like I'm in the backseat by him and I'm just concerned this will be a kind of long-term issue and not sure what to do.

t3_1on0nv5,"Once your dismissive avoidant ex comes back, how do you build a better relationship?","We met when neither of us was looking for anything, were friends for months but the sex drew us like magnets. 7 years later that has never faded.

We have done very toxic things to each other, where anyone who was in it just for the sex- even sex as mindblowing as ours- would’ve considered it not worth it long ago. But here we are, now both single (after I ruined his relationship after mine ended, mind you), and it’s as good as it ever was. 
He’s a DA &amp; says that this time, he’s feeling thoroughly happy being with me bc it doesn’t feel pressured or like he got “trapped in something I didn’t even know I was in.” He reflects upon how I’m much better than the ex he tried to date seriously &amp; in my life for a reason.

He texts me good morning &amp; good night every day &amp; we are having the same amazing sex &amp; he takes me out to amazing dinners and plans evenings.

Tenishia: “Uhhh. Are you serious?”

Brad: “Yes of course.”

Tenishia: “Uhhh. That is like very creepy that you would be asking me that!”

Brad: “...........What? How is that creepy? I was just asking you out to go get a bite to eat sometime, like at Subway Eat Fresh or Zupas or something.”

Tenishia: “Just stop! You are really creeping me out!”

Brad: “Ummm. Ok? Not sure how. I was just asking you out. That’s not creepy. People ask each other out like this all the time, and it’s always encouraged whenever they get advice.”

Teneshia: “Just stop right now or I’m calling the cops!”

Brad:  “Your behavior is very unnecessary, Teneshia!  All you had to do was say ‘no’ which you didn’t do, but instead you attacked me with false accusations!  Not ok!  Not cool!!  You need to grow up big time!!”

This is going to be long so sorry in advance if my English is wrong as it is my 2nd language.

So my ex broke up with me almost a month ago. He broke up because he wasn't happy or felt loved because I weren't able to prioritize the relationship because of my mental and physical health. I loved him with all my heart, but I understood his decision and didn't fight on it because this has been an issue for months. But during the break up is when the first signs appear. 

When he came to my house the first thing he did was hug me and kiss my forehead. I did not know he was gonna break up, but he obviously had made up his mind before coming over. He then said he wanted to talk. We got to my bedroom and started cuddling and then he dropped the bomb. Well not really a bomb. When he arrived he said he needed to talk and I guess I sort of knew where this was going.
He started talking about how he wasn't happy and this has been going on for too long. I obviously started crying, he continued to cuddle me and kissing me, saying that he loved me, but that it had to end, but that he didn't want to lose me, and that he still wanted me in his life as friends. After it was basically decided he asked if he could save the photos I had of us together to keep it as memories, which I think is weird cause why save the picture if you plan on dating someone in the future. Anyway he told me he could stay for as long as I wanted but I didn't want him there because I was having a literal mental breakdown so I asked him to leave. He asked for a kiss at the door. Not just a peck but a real passionate kiss. 
So after a few days of crying and my bestfriend forcing her way to my home to comfort me I decided to write him a letter, because in sensitive situation I can unable to talk about my feelings, but I'm very good at writing my feelings so that's what I did. After writing the letter way to many times I was happy with it. And I used the excuse of returning his clothes when I messaged him but he told me to keep them, but like why? So the week after I decided to take the letter to him after work, but when I message him about it he wanted to wait to the day after because I told him we could talk about it after he read it but he said he would rather wait to read when he could also talk about the same day because he didn't want to read then wait a full day, because he said he was still struggling after the breakup, which was surprising to because he looked fine and happy in all snaps he's been sending me. Anyway I told him I wanted him to read it first so he could have some time to think about it, then he decided to come to my work to pick it up. I work alone in a clothing store btw.
He comes and the first thing he does is hugging me, it was akward because both of us almost held hands as we always used to do after hugging. I step away to give him the letter, he takes it and briefly looks and commented about the lenght of the letter, he asked if he should read it there but I said no, but that we could talk the day after. He then again gives me a hug and leave. I start to clean and then suddenly he back again, and right away he gives me another hug, and then held my hands. He was impressed by the letter and agreed with it. I wrote that I could be friends with him but also that I would hope for a long time that we could find back to each other. He told me he needed time. And I regret not asking what he meant but I don't wanna be pushy.
Before leaving he gave me another long hug and then kissed me on my head, as he said he does with his friends. Which is true, but dude, time and place. As he was leaving he also said we should go on pizza dates.
Days go by and we still talk daily. And I asked him if he wanted to go to the movies to watch Five Nights At Freddy's and he said of course. 
On halloween me and my friend took the bus to my town but not at all close to where I lived so I complained to him even tho we were already planing to Uber, he suggested we came to him cause he lives close to the bus. Why would you suggest that your ex and ex's bestfriend to stay the night if you're completely done, but IDK I'm so lost.

Back to this week. He added me back to our shared calender after I told him I left it. Then a later day, one morning he called, and we have never been the calling couple unless it's something important or if we can't text like if he's driving. But he called just to tell me something about him having to go to another school for a couple of weeks, I was so confused but just happy to hear from him. And he has agreed to hang out but has been hesitant to really plan something.

Guys I'm so lost. I love him so much I don't want to lose him forever, but I don't want to push anything to give him space and time. I don't know what to think, all of my friends and mom is saying that these are signs that he's not done with the relationship but their opinion might be biased so I just wanted some unbiased opinions.

We have been out to eat several times. I been to his house a few times as well. I went over to his house Monday evening and we make out and he wanted to have sex but I couldn’t I’m on my period. Yesterday we barely talked which is unusual for us we usually talk or text all day for the most part. No good morning or good night text yesterday or this morning so far. 

He asked me for a bj since I couldn’t have sex and I said I don’t really like to give them until I’m in a committed relationship I have always been this way he didn’t act upset or anything about it. Just keeping saying he wanted to have sex with me. 

Maybe he JUST wants sex and that’s all is the conclusion I’m coming to now that’s he’s acting weird. 

He has been saying for the past week. He wants to be with me. He wants a serious relationship. He really likes me and my personality and all this. He wants me to let him be my man. I’m so confused. Monday when I went over there I talked to him about dating and getting serious soon because I been telling him I would like to wait a little bit before jumping into a relationship but I gotten comfortable and like him… He told me he would want to ask me to be his gf in a cute way. Umm ok! Weird seeing you been saying you want to be my man for a week now. I’m saying I’m good with it now. 

Advice??? Anyone been through this? How did it end up?  

I posted earlier today, but I wanted to give a 
UPDATE!!!! 

Because I felt like I was given really good advice and people told me do not message him unless he messages me well. He messaged me again today, but it’s just being really short and I just wanted advice as if he messaged me tomorrow if I should just not answer or if I should keep it short and sweet like I did today with him because I’m just really confused on to why we went to having full-blown conversations to obviously me not Giving him what he wanted sexually due to my period and now all of a sudden he just wants to make very little communication like is he just holding on to see if I will have sex with him later in the week since he knows that I got off of my period at the end of this week or what I’m just so confused on the whole thing",OkTheory8029,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1olkvbb,Title: Not sure where this “situationship” is heading — should I just stop trying?,"
Hey everyone, so I (25F) met this guy during our local festival back in September. We kind of hit it off there, and later I followed him on Instagram. He DMed me first, and that’s how we started talking.

At first, things were going really well — we were talking almost every day, joking around, and getting to know each other. I eventually told him that I had a crush on him, and he said something like, “Let’s just go with the flow.” At that point, I didn’t mind. I wanted to see where things could go too.

As someone who’s been single my entire life, I value honesty and clarity as this is all very new to me. So after a month or so, I asked him again what exactly we were. His answer was, “We are what you think we are.” I didn’t like that — it felt like he was dodging giving an actual answer.

To be fair, he has said that he likes me, but he doesn’t want to commit right now because he’s not in the stage of life where he feels ready for that. And honestly, I understand and respect that completely. That’s why I told him that we could just be friends instead — as long as we set clear boundaries so that neither of us gets hurt. But when I mentioned boundaries, he just dismissed it like it didn’t matter.

I’ve brought this up a few times — just to be clear about where things were going — because if it wasn’t leading anywhere, I’d rather just stay friends. The vibe between us was nice, and I enjoyed talking to him, but I also don’t want to be in something confusing.

We started talking around September 18th, and for the most part, I was usually the one initiating the conversation. I didn’t really care at first, but now it’s been four days since either of us texted, and honestly, I don’t even feel like reaching out anymore.

I’m not angry or upset — just a bit disappointed. I feel like if someone truly had the intent to keep you in their life, they’d at least make that effort clear. What do you guys think? Should I just let it be and move on, or wait a little and see if he reaches out?

If a 29 y/o guy at 6 weeks (counting from since first date) says he's not ready to commit yet/not yet ready for exclusivity and wants to explore but loves spending time with you, isn't really sure when he will be ready to commit but next girl he dates he will be all in and most likely will marry her. Do you think it's possible/common/do you know anyone who's experienced this that by about 12 weeks in he is ready to choose you? Of course this goes without saying that you and him continue to really open up and have great quality time together, great convos, great sex and just overall intimate and amazing connection. I know most guys who say they aren't ready for commitment but do really like you kind of need to get it out of their system before settling down. His actions show he has real feelings for me but his words and his brain are saying date around since you just moved to a new city.

He did mention that he had been in two long term relationships and they didn't end well so he wants to take things slow and be cautious. I guess this is pretty important context. He said in general he has been more of a relationship guy and when he has a girlfriend she is his entire focus so the next girlfriend he has he will be completely devoted to and will probably marry. I'm just bothered by the idea that he could probably be getting with other girls while we're talking and also by the fact that I just don't know when he will be ready. I feel like we should keep talking and hanging out and having fun and see where it goes but part of me is just anxious because I'm developing feelings

t3_1oj42xw,I need male perspective on this,"I’ve been seeing this guy for a month and a half now. (I’m 24F and he’s 24M) We’ve clicked on the first date and we were talking every day. We still talk every day however, lately I feel like I’m the only one making an effort to see him. We’ve both discussed about taking things slow (we’re on the same page). I need 2-3 months before deciding to be exclusive with someone. Considering that my past relationship I moved very quickly, but that relationship also fizzled out quickly so it’s important that I take things slow. I like that he’s emotionally mature enough to listen to my needs/boundaries etc. and he keeps saying “I’ll remember that.” I’ve expressed that trying to win each other over and getting to know each other is how I view dating. He’s mentioned that he’s busy with work and that he won’t lead me on until December if he’s still that busy by then. But I don’t know if I should continue pursuing this. I don’t know if he actually likes me… However, when I become distant (like not texting as often due to being busy at work, event, etc) he double texts me. So I don’t I don’t know what to do. I’m just confused. I’ve already expressed and that I feel like my efforts haven’t been reciprocated need more flirting and that we should see each other more, but it feels like he only listens, but doesn’t act. Any advice? I want to kind of see it unfold on its own. Whether it fades or grows. I still will live my life and decenter the idea that this could develop into a relationship. But maybe he is just busy considering his job is understaffed right now, and I should give him grace?

If anyone needs more context, info, let me know! Any advice or input is appreciated!

For the last few weeks I’ve noticed that he’s been complimenting me more, and the tone of our conversations have gotten more flirty. I’ve also noticed him sometimes mirroring my movements, and keeping eye contact for a while. He found and added me on Snapchat, and from there we added each other on Instagram. He pretty regularly likes my stories, and my new posts on Instagram. We text a little bit, but not an insane amount. Although he’s mentioned before that he looks forward to seeing me at work, and he misses me when I’m not there. With this in mind should I ask him if he wants to have a drink sometime?

t3_1ofj8pj,Having to choose between two guys,"For some context I'm 23F and live alone. 
OK, so I'm kind of involved with two guys right now. I've been talking to someone younger. I think he's 21.  We’ve been talking maybe like a month or a little bit longer? And then the older one he’s like 27? l've known for almost 3 years now. I’ve always called him my certified rebound because we've just been on and off again since we met  but he we've never technically dated. The older one I have been sexually involved with and exclusive with since maybe end of July? We've made it clear that we're both exclusive to each other, but we are not dating because he has commitment issues which I know that already which is fine. I'm being patient with him. 
On the other hand, I have the younger one there is an hour maybe an hour and a half away from me and we only ever talked on Snapchat. We don't ever text. We just send videos of us talking. I don't know if that's weird or not. That’s just how we communicate. We talk maybe like once a day. He’s cute, he’s closer to my age,  I get along with him well I think and he wants the same thing I do which is children and a family and to get married. Having a kid is really important to me because it’s all I ever wanted, and I miscarried beginning of this year And it's been excruciating ever since so I'm just ready to settle down. The older one hasn't even dated anyone in like six years. He already has two kids and he doesn't seem quite like a type that is going to want to get married and start a family, especially considering the fact that he already has kids which is a no for me on my mental list of dating do’s &amp; don'ts. I just can't see myself spending the rest of my life with someone who already has children with another woman that's just not what I want, but
things have been getting more serious between me and the older ones to the point where he’s actually considering dating me and we've been calling each other babe and shit like that recently and he's going out of his way to stop and see me at work and bring me dinner every night almost and of course coming over to my house so we can have sex together. 
How do I let the younger guy down because I don't want to be rude and I don’t want him to  feel like l've been leading him on or keeping him as my backup option which I kind of have but I do genuinely enjoy talking to him, but I think he's catching feelings for me and I'm gonna go with the one that yknow in the same town as me. i'm gonna have to stop talking to the younger one. I don't know how to get the point across that him and I can't talk anymore, that l've been talking with someone else the entire time and I'm not gonna ghost him. I had that I had that happen to me like in May and fucking ruined me. I cannot do that to him, but I don’t know how to tell him that I can't talk anymore without it being weird or rude.

t3_1oggl6m,Mixed signals around intimacy,"I (F, 28) have been seeing a guy (M, 28) for about a month. We get on really well and there’s a lot I like about him, but I’ve been feeling a bit confused and insecure about the sexual side of things.

We have quite different sex drives, I have a higher one, and he tends to want sex less often. When we talked about it, he said he thinks part of it is medication, and that he also needs more of an emotional connection to feel in the mood. For me, sex creates emotional connection, so it’s kind of the opposite dynamic.

We had another conversation recently where he said that he’s actually been holding back physically because he didn’t want it to seem like that’s all he was after, and that he wanted to prove to himself (and me) that we have an emotional connection too. He said he does like spontaneous sex, and that he probably didn’t explain himself well before.

But honestly… his body language doesn’t really match that. When we’re together he’s quite still, like we’ll be cuddling and I’ll try to be affectionate or initiate something, but he doesn’t really respond. It’s not that he’s rejecting me, it’s just very passive. So it’s hard for me to believe that he’s consciously “holding back” when it just feels like there’s not much physical desire there.

He’s mentioned wanting to go on more date nights and “do sexier things” to build more connection, but I keep feeling like the energy is off. I don’t want to make him feel pressured, but I also don’t want to keep building something that leaves me feeling undesired or unfulfilled. Physical connection is a big part of how I feel close to someone, and I know that if it stayed like this long term, I’d probably struggle with it.

I guess I’m wondering, is this something that can level out over time as we get more comfortable, or is it usually a sign of mismatch in sexual compatibility? And how do you navigate it without killing the mood or putting pressure on the other?",Consistent_Beat9133,Mixed signals,High
t3_1ofck2e,Waiting for a guy?,"I started seeing this guy consistently 2-3 times/wk at church groups/events about 6 months ago. 

When I met him, he just graduated from college. He didn't have a job, but he was waking up at 5a daily to work out and spend time with God. He lived/took care of his ill grandparents. 

I was attracted to how much the Bible spilled out of him in conversation. 

He consistently serves me any chance he gets, he greets me loudly from across the room, he is proud of my career, he asks questions, the conversations range from serious/deep to flirty to funny and everything in between. He respects my boundaries. He has become close with my sister and look forward to meeting my mom. He asked about my dad, who died last year. He asked how my childhood was and how having a good dad impacted that. He has opened up about his past.

Over time, he got a job training kids in sports, which lined up with his degree. 

When I was having a really bad day, he sat on the floor and washed me in the Word for 20 mins from memory. 

THE WAY THIS MAN PRAYS FOR ME!

During the summer, he went on a mission trip and decided that God was calling him to be a pastor. 

Now, he is an intern at church, he leads a small group of guys in accountability, he still has the sports job, he's still taking care of his grandparents, he is in a 40-week pastoral cohort at church, and he started seminary classes.

There is so much more I could say. 

Last week, for the first time, he said that he needs a wife while looking directly at me. It was a conversation with a couple girls and he looked right at me.
The next morning, he told my sister that he is interested in a godly young woman and is praying about pursuing her in a God-honoring way. He asked her to pray and not to tell anyone. 
She wasn't going to tell me, but then he sat next to one of my friends at a wedding and I kinda freaked out once I was alone because he waited for her to arrive and then sat with her.

I would have said yes if he asked me out in August. I've stayed composed when around him, but when I'm by myself, my mind/heart ache. 

I totally get that he's too busy for a relationship now, and I'm so dang proud of him for how much God has transformed him in the past 2.5 years. I would want a future son to be like him. I don't feel like I'm too much around him. I get excited about the godly character traits he has.

Thing is, it's really hard to keep waiting for him to ask me out when it's not promised. My life is full of ministry and serving, besides work. I can't get more busy. I get fulfillment from serving, and I focus on God, but my heart/mind still ache.",YesterdayFearless452,Mixed signals,High

t3_1odzxym,Caught feelings for an online friend of 6 years,"So, I \[M27\] have been friends with a girl \[F27\] for almost 6 years now. She is from England, and I am from Denmark. We originally met online playing World of Warcraft, and we have a close friendship along with some others from Denmark and the UK. We've met up several times before, though always in larger groups, and it's always been such great fun. Recently we've both become single however, due to reasons that are unrelated to each other. Since we were both in a similar situation, we started talking and gaming pretty much every day since. I guess we found comfort in spending time with a friend, who understood what the other person was going through. I know I found comfort in that.

It's been around 4-5 months now of us talking every single day, and a few months ago I started to catch feelings for her. I've always thought she was very pretty but had never thought about her like that before. Our other online friends started thinking that we were actually dating, because we spent so much time together, just the two of us. A few of them were even confident that if we were both single at some point in time, we'd end up dating, as we just vibe together so well.

A few weeks ago, I travelled to England for a concert that she also wanted to attend. It was also a good opportunity for us to spend some time together, which we have never done IRL before. Whenever we've met up it's always been with several people. Whilst I had developed feelings for her, I told myself that I wanted absolutely nothing to happen the short time I was there. I wanted to see how we got along IRL first, and I am also terribly afraid of ruining our friendship. I honestly consider her one of my best friends, and I would hate to ruin the friendship we have, by confessing my feelings. We ended up vibing really well together whilst I was there, and we had a lot of fun.

I should mention that I've talked with another one of my close female friends in our friend group. She says that she is pretty sure that the girl I like also has feelings for me, but the two of them aren't close like that, so they don't really share those kinds of feelings with each other. My friend from England isn't the most affectionate person out there and usually has her barriers up a bit. She isn't the biggest fan of hugging either. Though the last few times we have met IRL, we have shared a hug as we met up, and parted ways. This time was different, however. As she picked me up from the airport a few weeks ago, she didn't go in for a hug, which I respected. I didn't think much of it until the evening before she was dropping me off at the airport again. She mentioned that she regretted not hugging, and she thinks we should hug when I leave.

For around a month to 1,5 months before I came over, she had also been seeing this other guy very casually. We have always been open about who we see and so on. He isn't the greatest guy, and has some big red flags, which she is aware of. She just wanted to keep it casual between them, despite him wanting to make it official. However, the day before I arrive in England, she tells me that she had ended things with him. Maybe I am reading too much into that, but the timing was definitely interesting.

She is coming over to Denmark for New Years, along with some other friends we are meeting up with. Though I asked her if she would like to come over to my place first for a few days, before then going to the New Years party, which she agreed with.

Last week I thought I'd ask her to be my New Years kiss for the party. Figured that if she said yes, then maybe she would have feelings for me, and if she didn't, I could always play it off as either a joke or just a friendly little peg. She was quite surprised when I asked her, but ended up saying ""sure, why not"". Not exactly the most flattering answer to the question, but as I've mentioned, she isn't very openly affectionate. Afterwards I felt bad, almost as if she only said sure to get out of the situation. So, I texted her and said sorry, that was a weird thing to ask. She replied that she didn't think it was weird at all.

I really felt like she was maybe feeling some of the same feelings as me while I was there. But afterwards the guy she was seeing before has come back into her life a little bit. A few days ago, she mentioned that he had asked her to be FWB, and she isn't quite sure what to respond. One of the reasons why she didn't want anything official with him, besides the obvious red flags, was that she didn't feel quite ready for anything official due to the bad breakup she had with her ex.

We've talked openly about how we handle relationships and the lack of one before we were both single. So, I know for a fact that she can have a hard time letting go of someone who is affectionate of her, simply due to being afraid of being alone. I am the opposite myself. So maybe this is why she keeps on seeing this other guy.

Ultimately, I guess I just really don't know if I should admit feelings to her or not. On one hand I really do have feelings for this amazing girl, and even our mutual friends think we should date. Some of them even think she has feelings for me, despite never talking with her about it. On the other hand, I could ruin one of the best friendships I've ever had with someone.

This whole thing is just weird and new to me. I have no problem flirting and going on dates with girls I meet on Tinder. I've never caught feelings for a friend before though.",BoxAccomplished5890,General dating / relationship,Low

t3_1ob896i,Am I overthinking and overreacting about this 1.5year long relationship? (20M and 20F),"ok guys this is a long one i'm sorry.

Tldr: a lot of stuff happened between my ex and I. I still havent moved on and blame myself and she sometimes blames me as well. (Very bad tldr im sorry)

I (20M) started dating this girl (now 20F) in my first year of uni (both were 19M and 19F). I started liking her and talked to 1-2 friends about it. Turns out one of them liked her as well. We had a conversation and I told him, that I was willing to back off as I wasn't really looking to date anyone. But, one day he got really drunk, confessed to her and also told her about my feelings. After that it got a little awkward between us, but after a few months, we start talking more and slowly we become good friends. At this point, I had no intention of asking her out. All this while she became really really good friends with the other guy (I'll refer to him as A). Then a couple months later, there was this guy (call him B), who got really drunk and tried to make a move on her while she was drunk as well. That night, she kept coming onto me (who was oblivious to the B guy at that time). I kept pushing her away (like not rudely just was trying to not cause a scene), as I was sober and she was quite drunk. Later that night, I get a call from her best friend and she tells me. I instantly go to her room, call B and confront him. He denied but ended up kinda confessing. After that, the girl and I became better friends. A month later, she came to know my really close friend liked her and she started talking to him. But, she came and told me how she didn't think he was the right person. So one night she called me to talk about it, and we were sitting in the common area of the uni hostel and it was quite late (3am-ish) and she said she was very sleepy and to wake her up in 30 mins or so. I was sitting at a distance (obviously), trying to stay up but eventually fell asleep. I wake up a few hours later and see her rest on my shoulder and sleeping. Eventually she puts her arm around me. We wake up and kinda both giggle about it. In the next few days, we start getting a lot closer. Now, this was the first time I was ""interacting"" with a girl in any way. And she had been in 5-6 casual short relationships. I get too scared, and again as I wasn't looking for a relationship, I try to kinda run away from it. So I tell her this, that I wanted to focus on my studies but I liked her a lot. In my mind, I was hoping she would see that I was being shitty and say no. (I know I sound like an asshole already).

But, she says she is ok with it, and we carry on. Now, I completely kick out my previous notion and get very much into it. I start liking her a lot more than I had imagined. Then a week or 2 later, my parents came to know about my ""relationship"" (not official still), and they get very disappointed, something I didn't quite expect. My dad never shouted at me before, but he did this time and seeing that scared me a lot. So, I tell her this and ask for a couple days to think over all this. She get really really mad and leaves the room. The next day only, I decide that I like her too much and I want to keep that relationship with her. So, I kinda lie to my parent for the first time ever, and tell her all this. She was still quite mad that I broke up with her already but we make up. The next few weeks went really well and initially she didn't wanna make it official. But, I eventually ask her out officially in a way she really liked and stuff, and she says yes.

Now she had a lot of friends, which she liked to spend a lot of time with, and I didn't really have a lot of friends outside her. Now I admit I probably wasn't the best boyfriend in a lot of aspects, but I always tried to be there for her whenever she wanted. We grew really close together. Both of us had a lot of first with each other and it was going really nice. But, eventually I started feeling she wasn't into it 100%. She used to spend a lot of time and seemed to have more general fun with A. Like sitting and talking with him till like 5am and stuff. I never brought it up because I didn't wanna be controlling and she reassured me herself as well a few times. But, ig it did stay in the back of mind.

Now for some context, there was a uni group of about 9 people (6males &amp; 3females), including me, her, A and B. Some stuff happened, and a couple months ago, all of us decided to look for flats, and at that time (before the B incident), it was decided that me, B and 2 more people would look for a flat together. Now, the asshole step I did was to not change this decision about living with him. By that time, she had seemingly forgiven him, but still in retrospect a really shitty decision on my behalf. We fought over this often. Eventually, she started feeling more out of it, and I, now back with my initial thoughts about dating and all this decided to end things with her. She didn't take it well at all. A lot of crying and lot of other stuff I won't say here. This was just before summer break, so it was really really bad timing from me. I guess, I didn't expect her to react that way. It also made me realise that I didn't really want to break up with her. It was one of those listening to mind over the heart things.

Over the next month, we still talked a lot over text (as it was summer break), still acting like couples, then she would breakdown on vid calls, shout at me for breaking her heart, I kept apologising and just trying to be there for her. This happened for about 2 months, and my feelings only grew for her. We talked about what would happen when we came back from break, and both of mutually decided that we would just see what happens. Fastforward, to that. I go to meet her, I keep my distance to not seem like I am trying to make any moves, but eventually she does. From there, we kinda get back into it. She didn't wanna make it official, saying that she didn't want to be in that scenario again. But, we spent the whole day together, slept at each other's place everyday, basically everything couples do. I ask her out several times officially, but everytime she says no and says the same thing as above.

Then a few weeks later, she comes and tells me, she weirdly felt attractive to A that day.

Now, some context on A. After he confessed to her, and then after her and I started dating, he kinda never ""backed"" off. He made flirty remarks, called her hot and stuff, even in front of me. He started drinking more and visibly showing disdain towards me. I talked to his best friend, and he told me, ""Bro, he is in love. There is nothing you can do."". All I wanted was some respect and boundaries, given I was in a relationship. I brought up this with her a couple of times, and she just said to trust her and there wasn't anything between them.

Ok, so back to present. I am a little taken aback when she says that, but all I say to her is that it is completely ok to be attracted to someone, and it's a biological thing you can't control; what you can control is what you do about it. All i asked from her was communication and honesty. She agreed, and this was the first time, she said ""I love you"" to me and I obviously said it back. i was like completely and hopelessly in love with her at this at this time. Like, I bought stuff for her every other week, flowers, small gifts and stuff. Basically gave her all my time and energy. So, this happens, and then in the leading few weeks, she starts spending a lot more time with him, and not just in groups like she used to. I still choose to trust her. But, then one day, she calls me crying, and tells me that last night, she was with him in her room, and basically she felt very attracted to him. She didn't do anything, but basically she lied down with her head in his lap and stuff. I am taken aback a lot and she also keeps saying how ""we were not officially in a relationship"". But, I just say, see listen, nothing major happened. Just please have some more boundaries now. Don't spend so much time alone with her. Now all these months, she was very visibly not feeling the relationship with me. Always sleepy, never wanting to cuddle and stuff. Now a few weeks later, she basically says how she wants to experience other things and not just a serious relationship. I tell her, that I can't force her to stay in a relationship with me. If she wants other things, she wants other things. She asks me how I would feel seeing her with other people. I say obviously I will feel sad, but eventually I'll try and live with it. In my mind, I just didn't wanna be that clingy ex ig.

She says that, but we still don't break up, coz she keeps saying how she doesn't think she can do it, that she loves me too much. Again, after a few weeks, we talk about it again, and we decide to split up. But, we don't actually do it. Still sleeping at each other's place, and she keeps saying she doesn't think she can be with anyone else. Now, during this time, A is not in the city, and 10ish days after this, he comes back and their group of friends is hanging out. Next morning, again she calls me crying and tells me how they cuddled again last night. This time, I kinda break down. I didn't know what to say. She says, that she literally asked me if I would be ok and that I said yes, and how I am being unfair. And she cries a lot. Next day, I decide to try and work things out, so I decide to show up at her flat. I call her flatmate to let me in. She tells me that A was in the flat as well. Then, she prolly told her that I came. So, when I go in she had already sent him to another room or something. Now, he was there just because she crying a lot because of my reaction, but still i wanted her to atleast not hide things now. So I don't exactly patch up and I try to bring A up to see if she tells me but she didn't. She was probably trying to not cause another scene, but she didn't know I knew. I still felel heartbroken and confused. We talk the next day again, and I bring up this again. She breaks down again and says that I am accusing her so much. I just tell her how shocked I was and I felt heartbroken. I ask for her some space to think about all of this and process everything, so that I wouldn't end up hating her. She cries a lot again, but I decide to be firm. Next few days, I am distant from her, and she keeps crying to her friends, breaking down everyday.

I talk about this to the only other friend I had at the time, and he notes a similar experience he had, and asks me to try and move on. I act cold and distant to her for about 2.5 weeks. After that I give in to my feelings, and we kinda make up. I don't know how but we do. But, its very different obviously. We get into that situationship again. Now there's a lot more that happened after this and that is a whole another can of worms.

But, fast forward to today, and she now blames for giving her trauma, that the month where I asked for space was the worst month of her life, that she would never treat me like that. Now, she is another country, and now in another relationship, and I am still madly madly in love with her, not able to move on. I have given up on the idea of us getting back together, but I can't stop my feelings. My heart sinks everytime I think about her and her with another person. I genuinely wanted to see a future with her.

t3_1od0uka,gave my number to a guy at the bus stop but now I regret it,"So I was waiting at the bus stop and ended up chatting with this guy for about half an hour (he approached me). He was easy to talk to, and when the bus came he asked for my number. I gave it, mostly because I was caught off guard (no one’s ever asked for my number before) and it just felt natural in the moment.

Afterwards tho, I started stressing about it, like always. I’m not really interested in relationships right now (romantic or even friendship) and I've known that. I’m super busy atm and honestly too introverted to keep up with texting, let alone meeting new people. 
I figured maybe he changed his mind since he didn’t text for like 5 days, and I was honestly relieved because well suits me fine and him too. But then yesterday, he texted, just asking how I'm doing. And now I don’t know how to reply. He seems nice and we had a good chat, but it’s really not the right time for me to get to know someone new. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever be ready for that at all... And should I text back like normal if I know that? Doesn't seem fair on him, wasting his time.

I guess I’m wondering what’s the best way to handle this (kindly but clearly). I do feel sort of guilty for giving my number and then backing out, especially since the vibes were really there.",Ill-Award2030,Emotional pressure,High
t3_1oa8f2e,"My boyfriend keeps being inconsiderate in small ways, and it’s really starting to hurt me","Me (22F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been together for about two years. I love him, but sometimes he can be selfish or inconsiderate, and it’s starting to really affect how I feel.

A couple of days ago, I came home from a really frustrating day at work. All I wanted was to see him, talk about my day, and feel better. When he got home, he asked me what happened, and I started venting. But I could tell he was getting tired of listening. Then he said, “Sometimes it’s better to leave work stuff at work and not bring it into the house.” That really hurt, because I just needed someone to listen — not to fix it, just to care.

I asked (sarcastically) if he meant I should just bottle everything up, and he said “yes.” When he saw how upset I got, he tried to change the subject, saying something about keeping “positive energy” in the house. I ended up feeling even worse.

Later that night, I tried to calm down — took a shower, went to the kitchen, and he told me there was leftover chicken from the day before. When I opened it, it was literally just bones with barely any meat left. I looked over and saw a dirty plate with bones on it, meaning he had already eaten and didn’t leave me anything.

It’s not about the food — it’s the fact that he didn’t even think of me. I always cook for him, make sure he eats, and listen to him when he’s stressed. But when I needed him, emotionally or even just to think about me enough to save some food, he didn’t.

He apologized the next day and said it wouldn’t happen again. But today, something similar happened. I was cleaning and organizing the bathroom when he asked me earlier to make him a corn dog. I was in the middle of something, so I forgot. Later, when I remembered, I felt bad and went to the kitchen to make it — thinking I’d cook for both of us since we hadn’t eaten lunch or dinner yet.

When he came to kiss me, I smelled seafood on his lips. I asked if he ate something, and he said, “Yeah, I made some ramen.” It happened again — he made food just for himself, didn’t even think to ask if I wanted any, while I was cleaning and getting ready to cook for both of us.

It’s not about the food itself — it’s about how these little things make me feel invisible. I try so hard to take care of him, to be thoughtful and supportive, and I just don’t feel like I get the same energy back.

Am I overreacting, or does this show something deeper about how he values me and our relationship?",Revolutionary_Age702,Fear of overreacting,High
t3_1o8aqde,HELLO I NEED AN ADVICE WHAT TO DO,"Hi everyone, I’d like to ask for your advice about something.
I’ve been seeing a girl I’ve known for about ten years. Up until last year, she was actually engaged, but the engagement ended — she and her fiancé broke up.

Not long after that, we started spending time together, and eventually, we began sleeping together. At times, it felt like we were more than just friends with benefits.

This went on until around the beginning of September. After that, we started texting a bit less. She said she had a lot of work — and I believe her, because I’ve known her for years and I know she doesn’t lie about things like that.

The thing is, I started developing real feelings for her — the kind where I could actually imagine being in a relationship with her. So, about two weeks ago, I told her we needed to meet and talk. When we met, I told her how I felt. She told me that we probably should’ve talked about it earlier. She even started crying and admitted that she’s met someone else.

I was kind of shocked, but I understood — after all, we were never officially together, even though the feelings were there. She said nothing had happened between her and that guy yet, but that she feels attracted to him because he reminds her of her ex. I accepted that and told her okay.

She also said that the reason she slept with me was because she genuinely felt something for me, that she loves me, and that we just should’ve been more open about it earlier.

Since that conversation, things have changed — we text a lot less, and it doesn’t feel as natural anymore. We used to call almost every day or at least text often, but now it’s maybe three or four messages a day.

We met again two days ago, and I asked her directly — not because I want to pressure her into a relationship, but because I just wanted to understand why things have changed. She said that ever since we had that serious talk, she’s been nervous and confused about the whole situation.

So I asked her if that guy has something to do with it — if he’s the reason we don’t talk as much anymore. She suddenly changed her story, saying he’s just a friend, that they only meet once in a while because they have mutual friends, and that he actually lives far away.

She also told me that she just needs some time — that things between us aren’t over, and that it’s not like she wouldn’t want to be with me. But as I mentioned before, because of my past experiences, I always assume the worst. Whenever someone says they need time, I can’t help but feel that they’ll meet someone else and just forget about me completely.

Now I’m confused because she completely changed her tone about that other guy. I don’t know if she’s playing some kind of game, maybe to see if I’ll fight for her or something. I’ve had bad experiences in the past, so I tend to overthink everything.

She told me she still wants to stay in touch and keep seeing me, but her actions don’t really match her words.
So, I’d really like to hear your opinion on this.",jefff6969,General consent ambiguity,Medium

t3_1o8t0dz,The guy [32M] I'm [30F] seeing has a diaper fetish.,"We met in college and have known each other for about 10 years now, but only recently reconnected. We've only been seeing each other consistently for just over one month now but I see things developing into a long-term relationship. I'm extremely attracted to him (the sex is phenomenal) and truly enjoy spending time with him. He's been divorced for about two years now and hasn't dated anyone seriously since his ex-wife left him to be with her lesbian lover.

On Monday, he drunkenly texted me asking if I had any fetishes and if I was familiar with ABDL. I wasn't, so I looked it up and sent him the Google screenshot of the definition thinking he was fucking with me. He said, ""Baby girl needs to be diapered."" I was confused and don't want to kink shame, so I ended the conversation by saying he'd have to explain this to me when I'm not half asleep.

I had a work project in his town last night, so we planned a sleepover. While we were having sex, he brought up that I needed to be diapered and got off the bed and went into his closet. He pulled out a diaper and proceeded to literally put the diaper on me. I couldn't believe what was happening. Again, I don't want to kink shame and wanted to satisfy his indulgences so I played along. He asked me to keep it on all night, but I took it off saying that I needed to pee. He became frustrated and said he wanted me to pee in the diaper.

I'm still trying to process this. I like him A LOT and like I said, the sex is great (without the diaper fetish), and I see things going somewhere -- but I genuinely have no idea how to approach this.

TLDR The guy \[32M\] I'm \[30F\] seeing introduced me to his diaper fetish. We've known each other a long time and recently reconnected, I like him a lot and see things developing into a long-term relationship. I played along (faked it) with his diaper fetish to satisfy his indulgences. I don't want to kink shame, I like him enough to fake it, but I'm not into it and genuinely don't know how to approach this.",Lacey-Stretch,Silence as consent,High
t3_1o6mwr6,Confused.,"I'll keep it short as I'm really devasted. I've been dating this girl for almost a year now. Did everything for her. Listened to everything she had to say. Gave her everything she wanted Even without her asking. Loved her unconditionally. Obviously there were ups and downs she obviously did alot of mistakes but small thing to mention i completely changed myself for her. Never gave her a chance to even complain about the smallest things and always thought what will be better for her. She often did some things which I really didn't like. She talked to her ex once without informing me. She talked with random guys saying there my childhood friends, I'm talking to them about my work etc etc and i always told her to set her boundries as i wanted both of us to be on the same page. She told me that she understood what i felt like and said she'll never do anything like this again ever. This whole thing happened like 6 times and i always forgave her as i couldn't imagine myself without her. And these were all the things she did wich were related to a 3rd person she did alot more frequent careless mistakes repeatedly. 
That' a whole another story. But today i checked her instagram an there was a guy wo she already told me about and i was like ""cool i trust you"". But today i checked the messages and there was a text saying ""Good morning cutie"" i was little shocked obviously but after that there were other messages like he wanted to impress her, was constantly flirting with her and sent insta post like he wanted to put his arm around her waist, wanted to vist the shirine with her and travel with her etc etc. she didn't flirt back or never said anything that would give the guy any hint but always replied in a casual way and never confronted him or never told him to stop or never on her own blocked or ghosted him. I did tell her like a thousand times that I don't like this stuff and please set your boundries with other guys. Today i confronted her as usal and she said that he's my really good childhood friend and his intentions are not what you think. Like gurl I'm a guy too and I've done these things in the past too. She obviously realised for the 1000000th time she fucked up and started apologising and blocked that guy. But does it really matter that she blocked that guy after all this and after i confronted her? I told her that I've reached my limit which I actually have. I'm really furious and confused right now and wanted to know if i should really give her another chance or should i move on for better? ",Alternative-Cycle314,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1o63rjb,Feel like I can’t fully trust my partner and it’s making me anxious,"I’ve(21M) been talking to this girl(22F) since July. It’s a long-distance situation I’m actually moving to her city in January. We agreed to talk and be exclusive during this time, which she said is a big deal for her since she’s never done exclusivity before, even with her ex.

I was in her city August and September for work, and also able to visit her, and she’s supposed to visit me at the end of October. Everything on the surface feels good she seems into me, we communicate a LOT but I keep getting this uneasy, paranoid feeling that I can’t fully trust her. I know no one can “fully” trust anyone, but I mean it in that gut-level way where something just feels off.

It feels almost too good to be true that someone would agree to be exclusive and long-distance this early on, and I think that’s part of where my anxiety comes from. But it’s also small things that don’t quite line up.

When we first started talking, she said she’d been celibate before me and that I “broke her celibacy.” A few days ago, we were talking about exclusivity, and she mentioned she used to have a “roster” of guys she was hooking up with but that it distracted her from her daily life. She said that was earlier this year. I didn’t ask when exactly, but it made me wonder if it was right before me.

Then there’s this guy she used to sleep with last summer. She told me this “funny story” about how she helped him get back with his girlfriend. I thought it was just a random story until I found out she’s still friends with him… something she left out. I pieced that together after hearing different versions of the story and asked her about it. She said it was so long ago that she doesn’t even think of him that way anymore, that they just weren’t compatible sexually and became friends. The next day, she apologized for not mentioning that part and said it was weird for her to leave it out.

That kind of thing happens a lot small inconsistencies or details that change slightly. It makes me feel like I’m piecing together a puzzle instead of hearing a straight story.

Another example: the day we met, she told me a story about some “loan shark” guy who flew her out from Miami, she said she went for a few days, left, and never spoke to him again. She jokes that she has a bunch of airline miles now because of it. But yesterday, she said something like, “Thankfully I didn’t go to Miami with him and just got the points for it.” I was confused and said, “Didn’t you say you did go to Miami?” Then she said, “Yeah, one time the area he was in was pretty nice.” It’s little things like that that throw me off.

I’m not saying I’m perfect either. I’ve told my fair share of small white lies in the past, but as this relationship gets more serious, I’ve been trying to be as honest as possible. I want to build this on trust. It just feels like I’m the one leaning into honesty while she’s still a little vague or inconsistent about parts of her past.

I don’t want to accuse her of anything, but I feel uneasy and don’t know how to handle it. I really like her, but I also don’t want to move my life across the country if I can’t even tell what’s real.",DifficultBet261,Mixed signals,High
t3_1o5zslq,Did he care actually or was it all a lie?,"Hey Reddit. So I met this guy in April off of tinder, everything went extremely well and we started hanging out in person. He’d sent sweet long paragraphs while I was asleep. And we both deleted tinder. I came with him to his court dates for his tickets more than once and got really close with the family. He had a long term ex before me. They both are 21. For reference I’ll be 19 on the 25th of October. In their relationship she cheated on him multiple times throughout their relationship and after breaking things off they ended up doing stuff. He assumed that meant they were back together just for her to say she was just using him and it was a one time thing. She was blocked and would call using no caller id and was angry at the fact I picked up before. But this didn’t make our relationship worse. We ended up going on a small vacation together. A quick weekend get away. Everything with us was so perfect and then suddenly he grew distance. He got colder and meaner. He told me it was because his mental health was declining so I didn’t press on and tried helping him with cleaning his room and keeping up with the laundry. As time went on we began arguing more and I never got weekends with him and he only seemed to want to party. Whenever I brought this up he’d bring up his mental health again. And how he’s doing it because it’s the only time he feels okay and isn’t depressed which I understand being avoidant. He began getting secretive with his phone and one night while he was drunk I decided to look through it. I noticed he had been adding other women on snap trying to flirt with them but having no success and finding many other things. When I caught him he reacted angry at first but when I tried to leave he cried and begged me to stay promising to change. This happened 3 times. Well after last Friday we decided to go on a break. An exclusive break decided by him. Within this break he called me Thursday night crying on how he really wants it with me. That he’s trying and he wants to prove to me that he’s changing. Claiming he wants to work on himself because he feels that because he can’t love himself is why he couldn’t love me properly and the way I deserved. Well the next day rolls around and he went to his buddies for a guys night. I called him crying because I had begun going through a miscarriage. He was sincere and talked to me but then I heard her voice. The ex. She came out saying “what are you doing out here” with a flirty tone and when I asked he said it was his buddy robbi but he has a deep voice so I knew it was bs. I became hysterical and he then told me he wasn’t doing this tonight and hung up. I continued calling and eventually he blocked my number but unblocked it quick just trying to get me to stop spam calling him. I eventually showed up and he wasn’t around her he was just smoking with his buddy but the fact he was there with her broke me. I told him to unlock the car so I could get my things out of it and he only said to me “what are you doing here”. I got my things and I dumped his stuff on the street due to the heartbreak and the fact I was actively having the miscarriage. He brought her home that night and since spent the whole weekend bar hopping and drinking with her. I don’t know what to think or feel. My heart hurts. They both never removed me on socials until I blocked them due to discovering her things in his room when I went to get the rest of mine. Mind you he was telling me Saturday how he didn’t want to lose me and I stated that maybe he needed to completely lose me to even appreciate what he had and he said maybe. He wants to work on himself so we could try again in the future but when I went to his grandparents Sunday to get my things I seen her things there. I don’t know how to feel and I’m hurt. I still love him but I don’t know if he ever will actually change for me. I know he has abandonment issues and is terrified of being alone so maybe he has her there because of that. She sleeps around a lot and does nothing but drink. I honestly want to understand it but I’m also so clouded by how I feel I don’t know where to start.

t3_1o1i6c1,From Bogotá to Miami: How Latin Women Are Winning the Hearts of American Men,"Finding love across borders has become one of the most exciting trends of the last decade—and nowhere is that more true than in South and Central America, where thousands of women are meeting sincere, relationship-minded men from the United States.
This blog is written especially for Latina women who are curious about why so many American men are traveling to their countries for love—and how to build genuine, lasting connections that could even lead to a life together in the U.S.

Why American Men Look for Love in South &amp; Central America

Over the past few years, the number of American men traveling abroad for romance has grown dramatically. According to U.S. travel and dating industry data, international dating has increased by more than 30% since 2018, with Latin America being one of the most popular regions.
So, what’s driving this trend?
* Cultural values: Many American men are drawn to Latin American women’s warmth, family orientation, and loyalty. They appreciate that relationships here often emphasize emotional connection and long-term commitment.
* Authenticity: In many parts of the U.S., dating has become fast-paced and impersonal—dominated by apps and casual encounters. In contrast, Latin culture celebrates romance, respect, and genuine communication.
* Shared passion for life:Latin American women are often admired for their confidence, femininity, and joy. American men find this energy refreshing and inspiring.
* Desire for real connection:Many men traveling to South and Central America aren’t looking for flings—they’re looking for partners who value love, family, and shared dreams.
In short, these men are seeking substance over superficiality—and they often find that in Latin women.

How Latina Women Can Start a Conversation with an American Man

If you meet an American man through VacationAmor.co or in person, the first few conversations are key. Here are some tips to help you connect naturally and confidently:
1. Be Yourself
American men value honesty and authenticity. Don’t try to act or speak the way you think he wants—just be genuine. Talk about your life, your interests, and your culture.
2. Show Interest in His Background
Ask about his hometown, family, or favorite places in the U.S. Most men love when a woman shows curiosity about their life—it makes them feel valued and respected.
3. Share Your Culture
Teach him a few words in Spanish or Portuguese, talk about your favorite local foods, or invite him to experience a local tradition. American men are often fascinated by Latin culture and love learning from their partner.
4. Keep Communication Clear
Language differences can lead to misunderstandings. Be patient, speak slowly if needed, and don’t be afraid to ask for clarification. Many American men find accents charming and appreciate the effort you make to communicate.
5. Express What You’re Looking For
If you’re interested in a serious relationship, say so. Many American men are looking for commitment, and being upfront helps both of you know where you stand.

What Happens If the Relationship Grows Serious?

If your relationship with an American man becomes serious, you may want to visit or move to the United States. The process is straightforward but requires patience and preparation.
Step 1: Temporary Visit (Tourist Visa – B2 Visa)
A B2 Tourist Visa allows you to visit the U.S. temporarily for travel or to meet your partner’s family.
Requirements include:
* A valid passport
* Proof of ties to your home country (job, property, family, etc.)
* Financial evidence that you can support yourself during your stay
* A completed DS-160 visa application form
* A scheduled interview at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate
If approved, this visa typically allows you to stay in the U.S. for up to 6 months.
Step 2: Fiancé(e) Visa (K-1 Visa)
If you and your partner decide to get married, he can apply for a K-1 Fiancé(e) Visa on your behalf.
Requirements:
* You must have met in person within the last two years
* Both must be legally free to marry
* He must meet financial requirements to sponsor you
* You must marry within 90 days of arriving in the U.S.
After marriage, you can apply for Adjustment of Status to become a permanent resident (green card holder).
Step 3: Permanent Residency (Green Card)
Once married, you can apply for a CR-1 or IR-1 spousal visa to live permanently in the U.S.
Benefits include:
* The right to live and work in the U.S.
* The ability to travel freely
* Eligibility to apply for U.S. citizenship after three years of marriage

Real Statistics: Love Without Borders
* Over 15,000 K-1 fiancé(e) visas are issued each year by the U.S. government, with Latin America among the top regions for approvals.
* According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, more than 60% of international couples who meet through verified dating platforms remain married for at least 10 years.
* Surveys show that American men rank Latin American women among the most desirable partners for long-term relationships due to shared values and emotional connection.

t3_1o1cw37,I have anxiety and I'm overthinking our relationship :((,"I've been dating the sweetest and most adorable guy ever. He's from another country and he's really just the sweetest. I'm 20F and he's 25M. We've been dating for a while and he keeps reassuring me for everything. Although, since I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, I've been overthinking everything lately. 

I keep on thinking that he doesn't find me attractive at all and that maybe he's just being nice. I would think that he's too good for me and I'm way out of his league. 

I've been overthinking how my body looks lately. I'm a skinny and very thin girl. I kept thinking that it bothers him too but he said he loves it nonetheless, though I can't help but overthink.

I would always ask if it's the best time to talk to him cause I don't wanna be a bother but he'd tell me that I can message him anytime and that he'll probably reply slow cause he might busy but he wouldn't mind my messages. Still, I'm anxious about and I don't want to ever annoy or bother him. 

Does he really like me? Am I really good enough for him? Am I even in his league? I feel so ugly and unattractive even though he kept saying I'm cute.

t3_1o0tkpo,Does my friend have a crush on me?,"Hii I (18F) started college about 2 months ago, and 4-5 weeks ago I found a good group of 4 people (2 guys and another girl my age).

Yesterday afternoon i finished all my homework and i sent a message to our group chat asking if any of them wanted to come over. I didn't really expect anyone to come because I live in offsite housing so it's a bit of a trip on the bus, but one of the boys (we'll call him Jack) said he'd come by.

He got there around 3 I wanna say? He's pretty reserved, doesn't really say much in person but in the gc he's much chattier. Anyway, the first half hour was kinda awkward but after that we just started talking. He asked me a bunch of questions (and I him), but they were *good* questions. Some of them were deep, but still creative and interesting. He even asked what I'd wanna name my kids. We did interval drawing, which was really fun, and I *tried* to him some Russian.

I have a very weird set of skills (ambidextrous, can read a couple alphabets, draw, paint, all kinds of whistles) and he was just glazing me the whole time (he was there for like 6 hours, I thought it'd only be a couple, but we were having a lot of fun) calling me cool and awesome and stuff like that.

When he came over and finally let loose a bit he sat on the floor and I copied him, copied a couple other things and said ""haha I keep copying you"" and he said ""nahhh I'm always copying you haven't you noticed?"" then again idk if that was flirty bc I have never done anything w a guy like I've never even held a guys hand LMAO. I told him that too, and he was really surprised.

We had to go outside because my roommate wanted to go to bed, so we sat by the pool and continued our drawing. We sat at one of those long chairs and eventually were lying across it on our stomachs like right next to eachother. I didn't really notice that he was cute until then.

There were quiet spells where we just sat there for a couple seconds. I'd look off at something else, look back at him, and he was looking at *me*, but then he'd look away when I saw him. He's quite shy, and smiles when we make eye contact and can't look me in the eye too long.

Eventually, he had to go home because the shuttles were going to go dark. We were waiting by the gate for one to come, just lying on the ground looking at the sky. We just kept talking and I found I didn't want him to leave.

TLDR: vital context missing, but I made friends w this guy about a month ago but even though he's shy he says/does stuff that makes me think he likes me (looking at me when I'm not looking, complimenting me, being invested in my life) and we hung out 1:1 last night for the first time and I had a really good time.

t3_1o0dtoc,"My (21F) nature (shy, self-conscious etc.) is making my boyfriend (25M) feel physically unwanted and unattractive — how can I make it better?","Hi ,
I’m posting this because I really want to understand what’s going on between me (21F) and my boyfriend (25M) and how I can make it better for *both* of us. We’ve been together for almost 2.5 years now.

A bit of background:
This is my first relationship. He, on the other hand, has had a really traumatic past relationship where he was treated badly and made to feel unwanted. His family is also extremely toxic — both parents — and he’s had a really hard life emotionally. My family is very loving and stable, but they’re traditional (caste issues etc.), so I always avoided relationships before him.

When we met, I was very hesitant but he made me feel safe and slowly I fell in love with him. ❤️

He was the one who initiated our first kiss, first make-out, etc. I never stopped him, I wanted it, but I’m naturally a *very shy* and *self-conscious* person. I get in my head a lot (“I smell, I sweat, I look bad”), especially about intimacy. He’s never judged me and always reassured me.

We’ve been physically affectionate — kissing, making out, being playful — and I *do* kiss him first sometimes, hug him randomly, tease him, etc. But he recently told me he feels *physically unwanted* and *unattractive* in our relationship. He said things like:

* “You don’t initiate physical things.”
* “You still say you’re not comfortable showing your body after 2.5 years — how is that possible if you find me attractive?”
* “It makes me feel like you don’t desire me physically.”
* “It feels like you’ve never made me feel welcomed to any part of your body.”
* “You keep telling me to lose weight or take care of myself — why can’t you accept me as I am?”

He’s gained some weight recently (mostly from stress and late-night eating), and I *do* tell him to take care of himself — not because I don’t accept him, but because I want him to be healthy and feel confident again. But he takes it as rejection, as if I don’t love him the way he is.

The thing is, I’m not refusing intimacy — I just need him to lead because I get shy and self-conscious. It’s not that I don’t *want* him, I just need emotional comfort first. I told him I need a little more time and reassurance, but he says, “After 2.5 years, that’s not a valid reason anymore.”
The other day he said me  not letting him see my vagi*na , or telling reason of i still am not ready to show my vagi*na, even after 2.5 years isnt a valid reason anymore, it just means i dont find him attractive or i dont have desires about him, thats not the case i just want him to take lead atleast for now, or else its okay if he stops telling me to initiate slowly i will, but im scared what if it isnt what he wants( he says all these are bare minimum)

He feels like his previous trauma is repeating — that he’s once again with someone who doesn’t want him physically. That broke my heart because that’s not true at all.

On top of that, I’m preparing for a competitive exam and college is draining me, so my mind’s been preoccupied. For him, physical intimacy is how he feels loved; for me, it’s emotional connection and stability.

When these fights happen, they get really long and painful. But I love him deeply and want to spend my life with him. I just don’t know how to make him feel physically desired *while still staying true to who I am* (shy, slower-paced, self-conscious).

TL;DR:
My 25M boyfriend feels physically unwanted and unattractive because I (21F) am shy and slow when it comes to intimacy. He feels like I don’t find him desirable, especially since I ask him to take care of his health. I love him and want to make things better — how do I show physical affection and desire in a way that feels natural to me, but still makes him feel loved? He is isnt speaking abt verbal way of  showing love this is completely physical

t3_1nzv3qz,WHAT DOES THIS EVEN MEANNNNNNNNNNNNN?????,"Reposted from another sub.

Hello, Reddit. I'll provide some details about myself for the story to be more coherent.

I was born in Caracas, Venezuela, in an upper-middle class family: nothing flashy or extravagant, my parents could just afford to send me to an elite private school (not that expensive in 2010) and trips overseas. They taught me too appreciate everything I had, because nothing was ever free or to take for granted (they had money, yes, but they both came from dirt poor families and worked their way up). I grew up internalizing this lesson with the later borderline civil war and economic crisis that struck my country haha, and have poured my time and effort studying to build something of my own like they did. I am now overseas, keeping up a half scholarship, still with my parents (costs of living alone are too high, and I take 10 subjects a semester), and running some side hustles on the side (yet they don't generate life changing money, just extra income that's appreciated), and I'm proud of myself and my family. We've lost everything over and over, and yet here we are: strong, rising yet again. I'm still conscious over the cost of stuff even if my parents chose to finance my college years, but hey, I live fairly well.

Now, context about the whole the proposal guy: I downloaded Tinder a while ago, and I wasn't quite liking the experience to be honest. My friend, however, wanted so badly to go out on dates she convinced me to try the ""double date"" feature one day while we studied. We had a few matches that day, both by ourselves and in the double date tab-thingy, but it was late and we had to go home. We walked together to the bus station, and right as I was about to take out my bus card, two ladies came up to me and tried to steal my wallet. I have some trauma with both armed and unarmed stealing, so it drove my stress chemicals so high it gave me a migraine. I stayed home the next day, and once my migraine was a little less invasive, I checked my phone notifications: hot guy ""A"" had texted me.

That caught my attention, given that the whole reason I wasn't liking Tinder was that guys in the app would NOT even say hi to save themselves, so I replied and I made a smartass ""well acshually"" comment about something in his bio. He loved that, oddly enough. We exchanged IGs and I kept making funny smartass comments (nothing offensive, just ""did you know...""s), then he noted how I was such a ""breath of fresh air"" among so many ""boring girls in his city"", and that he wanted to fly me out to meet him.

If you think the paragraph above escalated too quickly, man, for me it was worse. I thought this man was joking, but I check is IG and it's FULL of stories showing trips, cars, shit like that. He DID have the kind of money to blow on stupid ass plans like that. Honestly, I do not care about luxuries and partners to ""sugar"" me up (and GOD KNOWS I've dated broke guys myself), but you know... the idea of someone flying me out to meet them was nice. However, I'm latin american, and I am aware of the dangers PassportBrosTM have brought to women in simmilar conditions than mine (young, in school, not rich). I do not have that kind of money, sure, but it's not like you can wave a fan of bills and expect me to be on my knees.

We talked about my doubts regarding a borderline stranger flying me out across the Atlantic and he said ""listen, I work hard, I make enough for me to pour in whatever I want and you're worth it"". I was like ""hell yeah, sure, whatever, good for you buddy! but what if you traffic women? I don't know that!"" and he said ""I can provide any documentation you need in case you are having cold feet, don't worry"". I was still hesitant so I ran my own background check (I'm venezuelan, knowing how to background check someone else is like a basic life necessity), and sure enough, motherfucker wasn't lying. I told him to wait until the semester ended because I had finals coming up, but two days after that I got pretty much ghosted.

Was it because I took too much time to decide if I was hopping on the plane or not? Was I getting played? If I just sent him a message saying ""im ready now"", would he keep talking to me? Honestly I enjoyed so much talking even before I knew he was rich, I genuinely don't give a shit on how much money others have because 1. I have my own and 2. that's none of my business, but I'm worried that if I keep asking questions like ""heyyyy why did you ghost me"" I'll seem like a golddigger, or if I just accept to hop on a plane exactly now I'll seem manipulative.

t3_1nxb28q,Is he interested or just bored?,"Need help with dating advice
F-25, M-26. I met a guy online during a trip and we got close quickly. We got intimate on the second date. He treated me well, and I even told him he seemed like a gentleman and that I’d like to stay in touch. I asked him what he wanted to do next, and he told me from the start that he wasn’t sure if this would work out since we live in different states. I told him I’d be back to visit.

But after that, he stopped replying and didn’t keep the conversation going. Months later, he randomly texted asking if I had moved or visited his city. I responded, and we talked briefly about travel plans. I mentioned I had plans with friends instead. I didn’t follow up further and showed some disinterest.

A month later, he texted again asking about my plans. I asked why he was trying to reconnect after disappearing. He said he had been traveling abroad, wasn’t thinking about dating, and had dated others but didn’t feel a connection. Then he asked if I had felt a connection with him and if we could continue things.

I explained that he had stopped responding, so I assumed it was just a one time thing. He apologized and tried to say it was both our fault, but I told him it was on him. He apologized again, and I told him I’d be open to continuing.

We’re just texting now. I’m wondering if he genuinely wants to reconnect or if he’s just playing.",Dangerous_Shake_1658,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1nxa7wg,I (20F) have been seeing a guy (22M) for a month and he’s sending mixed signals — should I keep trying or move on?,"I (20F) have been talking to this guy (22M) for a little over a month now, and I’m honestly confused about where things are going.

At first, things started slow — for the first two weeks we didn’t even kiss, but we both liked each other and hung out almost every night. Eventually, he started sleeping over at my place, then I stayed over at his. One night we had some wine and ended up having sex. After that, we started hooking up almost every time we had sleepovers.

The problem is, we have opposite schedules. The only real time we get together is late at night, so our “relationship” has mostly been sleepovers. We’ve done a lot together, met each other’s friends, and we both clearly like each other — but we haven’t had much daytime time together.

Another issue: I feel like I have more money than him, and sometimes it feels like he takes advantage of that. He’ll ask me to buy him Red Bull, beer, or food. I don’t mind helping out sometimes, but it adds up. At the beginning he did bring me flowers and cook for me, which was really sweet — but since then, I feel like I’ve been the one putting in more effort.

For example: I asked him to buy me a vape since I’ve bought like four in the past month (he uses them just as much as I do). When I went to his house, he hadn’t gotten it, so I was frustrated. Later, I brought up how I feel like he isn’t putting in as much effort or treating this like a relationship.

That’s when he told me:
	•	He really likes me, but feels like I don’t show him enough affection. (This confused me because I’ve done his homework for him, bought him things, introduced him to some of my family, and spent most of my free time with him.)
	•	He dropped all but one of his classes and is unsure what he wants to do with his life. He’s even thinking about leaving school, his frat, and moving to Florida for real estate.
	•	He said, “What if we’re talking for a few months and then I decide I don’t want to be with you?” which… made me feel uneasy.

We had plans to go to my family’s lake house, but I cancelled because I wanted to just spend the day with him locally. He then told me that he was planning to ask me to be his girlfriend at the lake… but since I cancelled, he didn’t want to ask anymore. He also said he’s hesitant about making it official if he might end up moving away.

After that conversation in the car, I was honestly ready to just go home. But he convinced me to come inside instead. When I did, his roommate was conveniently in the middle of breaking up with his long-term girlfriend — literally right after we’d just had that serious talk. The timing felt so weird.

The next day though, he was super sweet — he took me to lunch, we went thrifting, picked flowers, and then went to dinner where he even introduced me to some of his coworkers while we waited for our reservation. It was honestly a great day. But that night, he didn’t kiss me goodnight or even try to have sex (we haven’t in 3 nights now). The next morning, he only hugged me goodbye — no kiss.

So now I’m getting really mixed signals: he says he likes me, but sometimes his actions don’t line up. I feel like I’ve been putting in a lot of effort, but I don’t know if he’s serious about me, if he’s just confused about his life, or if he’s stringing me along.

My question is: should I keep trying with him, or should I move on and keep my options open?

He’ll pop back up and vaguely explain what is going on, I offer my support, then shuts me out again for another 2 days. I found out that he’s shutting everyone out including his family &amp; best friend.

He says it’s not fair that anyone has to listen to or deal with his personal issues which I understand, but it still hurts when he shuts me out. It makes me feel like I did something wrong or I’m not good enough at comforting/being supportive for him to seek comfort from me.

I was always a big believer that long distance never worked as I tried in the past. This was all mentioned to him as well.

He is kind, respectful, and genuinely sweet in many ways, so I don’t think he is intentionally doing anything to hurt me. But there are issues that are making me very hesitant to move forward, and I need some perspective.

The hardest one to ignore is that his semen has the most revolting odor I have ever experienced. It is not just mildly unpleasant, it is nauseating, like rotting food and fish combined, and it clings to anything it touches. I actually gagged just doing laundry after, and the smell still lingered. This alone makes me dread intimacy with him and I feel repulsed to the point that I am questioning if there is even a way to get past it. I also wonder if it could be a medical issue and whether I should be concerned for my own health too.

On top of that, the sex itself is not good. He is much more focused on his own pleasure than mine, and he once finished inside me without my consent and brushed it off as a “whoops.” That left me feeling really violated and unsafe. I have also noticed a shift in the effort he puts in. At the start he covered most of our dates, but now I am the one spending more, cooking for him, and even paying for things he should have taken care of. When I am running around stressed with chores, he does not complain if I ask for help, but he does not take the initiative on his own either. I even explained that acts of service are important to me, but it still feels like I have to spell it out every time.

So here I am, stuck between the fact that he can be caring in daily life and the reality that these issues, especially the odor and the non-consensual moment, make me feel grossed out, violated, and unsure if I should keep this going.

t3_1nqtu7i,I’m nervous,"I’ve (22f) been seeing this guy (30m) for about three ish months now. We started seeing each other after I had a bad breakup with my ex. I knew him before hand and was attracted to him but never let it go anywhere out of respect for my relationship at the time. 

When we initially started he said he wanted to respect me and what I was going through and that we’d keep things casual and see where things went down the line. 

Since then we’ve seen each other regularly with him taking me out on “dates”?  While out people assume we are couple because we always end up matching our outfits unintentionally (though sometimes when I meet him and he’s getting ready he’ll choose an outfit to compliment what I’m already wearing). He treats me really well, pays for almost everything when we’re together (I have to fight him to buy things a majority of the time), he offers to get me food while I’m at work or sometimes just surprises me if he’s already out and about, has bought me things for his place while I’m there, offers me reassuring words and advice when I’m stress, goes out of his way to see me or allow me over late at night even if it might not be conducive to his personal schedule, and so on. When we are out he points out when I’m being checked out and will pull me closer to him and put his hand on the small of back or rub my shoulders almost like he’s laying claim over me ? When we were together he says things like my touch and presence is not quite like others he’s been with (in a good way). 

I have been turning down advances from others because I can’t see myself with anyone else but him. 

Getting to know but as I’ve gotten to know him more and spend time with him, I hate to say it only because I didn’t intend to as I wanted to remain single to heal but I’m falling for him quite hard. We have really good chemistry all around. I really like his energy as he’s so calming to be around and I find talking to him very stimulating. He makes me want to better myself in every way. He ticks literally every mark I look for in a partner from mentality/mindset , sexually, to vision of the future life. 

I catch glimpses of what I think is affection in his eyes and actions and I’m nervous that I might be delulu and reading into things as a month ago I admitted to him I do have feelings for him but still would like to take things slow which he reiterated our original agreement and that i knew his feelings on  anything more which left me kind of confused since it was left kind of open initially. Recently I admitted that I was falling for him and he said it wasn’t a convo to have over text which I agreed but wanted to be honest with myself and him.

I’m also nervous because I get how my situation might be a lot as I’m regaining my footing still with children at my side but I feel like I’m in control of everything at this current time and am striving to better myself even further while he is already stable and happy with his current standing. I really just want to know his stance and if he’s interested in potentially pursuing a relationship with me in the future but im not pushing for him to ask me to be his girlfriend.

I have known guy one (let’s call him tom) since I was 6 years old and I have known I’ve loved him since we were 14 but we never dated till we were 18/19 years old , it was one of the best relationships I have ever been in he is one of the sweetest people I know and I describe him as a golden retriever Rottweiler mix dog, now we split up over a year ago because of my medical issues and he had a lot of time issues between work(night shift every day, I worked mornings almost every day) , friends and family , we had decided that we couldn’t be there for one another in that time, it was an amicable break, for the past year his mother has been trying to get us back together in numerous occasions. Recently she did connect us once again weirdly by getting me to buy fresh egg from her ,meaning I would have to go to their house. Tom and I did talk about it and we both live each other we just think we would need to take things very slow 
Now guy two (let’s call him john) I have known him for just about a year we have been talking on and off ever since we met because he is in the military and I’m in college, we have only hung out in person about 4 times and none of his family knows about me which is concerning but to be honest he is perfect in my eyes , I also deceive him as a Doberman. I struggle every day not knowing how he feels about me cause I know he likes me but he can never give me a straight answer to what he wants with me and I know I know one of the biggest red flags but he knows me better than anyone else, but I can never tell if he’s leading me on or if he wants something serious 
My mom says that no matter what John is the man I should focus on more just because she said he’s a man and tom is still just a kid, I think of it as John had to get his life together faster than tom did because of the military where as tom has been building and building his career and trying to keep his mind steady on the things he cares about . But All my friends say I should stick with tom cause he’s in a situation where he is ready to try again but take things slow to get to know each other once again. this is the hardest thing in my mind lately and I can’t comprehend what to do in this situation, I love both of them and I can’t see my future without either of them.

t3_1nmsj28,Should i even try to be her friend?,"This is a long story.

I used to have a crush on this girl and found out my friend also had one on her, cause i had his insta account and i snooped. 
I proposed and got Rejected but she and i were great friends so we continued talking. She'd tell me everything about her, her past and stuff. We talked like couples but weren't one. So i proposed again well not technically she asked and i said if i still like her and got Rejected again.
 So we stopped talking for some days and in between he and her talked about me, and he tried to not entertain her and me together. 
Nothing evil just not enthusiastic. I saw him message her and i decided to end the fight as he was maybe gonna rid my chances with her. So i finished and told her, he likes you ,so just don't discuss Me and You stuff with him.
But she stopped talking not cause of this but cause he was too clingy, he became all mentally broken down and i helped him, he was suicidal and all because he liked her, i made sure he didn't, he finally confessed he liked her to me and he tried to destroy what she and i had, i said that i knew and don't worry about i, I'm not angry.

 3 days later all of a sudden he died.  But all this while he sent her audios and messages saying sorry and please talk to her.
This made her all mentally breakdown and cry and stuff and me too.
I didn't cry but i was f*cked up by this. She blamed herself for his death and i blamed myself cause i also seperated them right?

I had his account and to make sure he didn't say that would f*ck her up even more i unsend some voices and she sent a voice saying sorry. I opened it so that she feels better thinking he saw it.

So i started taking care of her, endless calls, checking up on her, sleepless nights and being there for her and i wasn't having it easy either but i was taking care of her so i didn't care myself and suddenly one day she said ""You and me, we're never happening"" out of nowhere, i never asked her. So i just got angry, a little argument happened and i went no contact to face my issues and get away from it all. 
Facing rejection for 3rd time from same girl just made me angry. After 3 weeks of avoiding her, i was afraid of her mental state and checked and told her we should be friends again. She accepted, 

we talked for about 2 days till she asked why i was different?
I said I'm not, this is how i am, you wanted me to be your friend and i am. This is how i am with my friends. She said it's okay if you don't wanna talk and this made me angry and i said if it's that way then maybe we shouldn't talk and i just stopped chatting cause it was exhausting me.

I didn't talk to her for 1 month till i realised she and I are in the same class, we should bury this issue and be friends.
She said I'm not interested.

I tried explaining that i was in a bad phase and that's how i deal with grief.
She's not tense anymore so we shouldn't.
I told her that cause i was trying to get her better ny emotions were oppressed and it came out, it's not her fault, I apologize for acting immaturely.

She said i know it's not my fault, why would it be?
This angered me so much
I said it isn't and stopped the conversation.

So 2 months later she did apologize and  said she said those stuff so that i might move on but didn't ask to be my friend again.

So my question is should i try to patch up and be just friends after all of this? Not cause I want a relationship oh hell no i still got feelings but i know she's not right one but we're still in the same class and she keeps interacting with my friend group and i see her glancing at me from time to time.",Ztheabe,General consent ambiguity,Medium
t3_1nms8cr,Men dont ever doing anything that they don’t want to do.,"I had a ex that would invite me to things he wanted to do. Nephews games , I would go not because I wanted to . Which I did , but because I wanted to spend as much time with him even if it’s for something I I didn’t really care about. 
But when I wanted him to go to my nephews sports he never wanted to , and the the few times he did go It was because I had to ask him to come with me .
So dating now . A guy told me it’s my choice and I told him I wanted to go somewhere that’s vigil . I didn’t want to miss it , he said okay . I was like why are you keep saying okay . He then said  he didn’t want to go to it but I can if I want.
 I have plans for earlier in the day and I planned to see him at 5 but I didn’t want to miss the vigil and wanted to make time for him and spend more time with him.
My question is why is it women always put other people wants and do whatever a guy wants as an activity just to be with them? But men are like the opposite, unless it’s a guaranteed getting something out of it for themselves.?",90skidturnelderly,General consent ambiguity,Medium
t3_1nm92q2,"How should I act at a party/wedding around a guy I like, who told me he’s not ready? :(","
Hi everyone, I need some outside advice.

About five months ago, a friend introduced me (f,30) to a guy (let’s call him Max, 30) at his birthday party. Both are single since 1 year after long relationship (me 4 years, he 9).

After the party, Max was the one who reached out and started texting me instagram.

We started writing a lot. About two months in, I asked about meeting up. He told me honestly that he wasn’t ready for anything right now. I was upset at first and pulled back, but he kept putting effort into staying in touch.

Since then (5 months) we’ve continued as “friends” – but the connection is still there. We exchange long texts, voice notes, and pictures about once or twice a week. It’s more than just surface-level small talk.

Now, the wedding of the friend who introduced us is coming up – so this will be the first time Max and I actually see each other in person again. Part of me still hopes there might be chemistry, but I don’t want to come across as needy or desperate. I just like him :( 


I also feel like I’ve been leading most of our conversations – asking questions, making jokes, and referencing our shared insider things. Lately, I’ve been replying less over the past few days because I want to give him more space before we see each other at the wedding and also I feel too much. :(

Maybe he is still not over his ex or still hopes a coming back? 


My question is: How should I behave around him at the wedding?
	•	Should I just be friendly and keep some distance?
	•	Or should I show that I’m interested?
	•	How do I balance enjoying myself at the wedding and still giving him the chance to see me in a new light?

Any advice or personal stories would be super helpful",adre_nalin2402,Repeated asking,High
t3_1nm4eh7,Confused about a first date – was I overreacting?,"I (24F) went on a date with a guy (26M) two weeks ago and ended things as soon as I got home. But I keep replaying the night in my head and I’m not sure how to feel about it. For context: I’ve never had a boyfriend before, and this was only my second first date in my entire life.

He picked me up, and during the drive he put his hand on mine even though I didn’t give any signal I wanted that. At the bar, he kept holding my hand, kissing it (like 30 times), even biting my fingers. He kissed my shoulder, touched my waist, pulled my chair closer, tucked my hair behind my ear repeatedly. I kept undoing it because it made me uncomfortable. The bar was loud, so we didn’t talk much. I mostly tried to watch the band and ignore what was happening.

Afterward we went for a walk and sat on a bench. He hugged me, kissed my hair, touched my lips, and I felt like if I turned my face he would’ve kissed me. Throughout the date he was complimenting me nonstop (“you smell so good,” “I wish I met you earlier,” “we could do that together,” etc.). It felt like love bombing.

I didn’t say anything in the moment because I felt frozen and foggy. He even asked twice if something was wrong, and I still stayed silent. Looking back, I realize I might be too much of a people-pleaser, and I didn’t know how to say “no” without feeling rude.

When I got home, he texted saying he had fun and asked if I did too. I said yes (again, people-pleasing), but an hour later I told him honestly that I was uncomfortable and didn’t think we had the same expectations. He apologized, said he didn’t mean to upset me, and asked for a second chance. I told him insisting would make it worse, and he finally dropped it. I unfollowed him but we still have each other’s contact info.

Now I’m confused. Was I overreacting? Was this borderline sexual assault? Or is it just that he moved too fast and I froze instead of speaking up? Part of me knows I did the right thing by ending it, but another part wonders if I should have given him another chance.

t3_1nj5in7,Do we overemphasise on consistency in relationships/dating? HELP.,"For context- I am 21F and my generation has been taught by social media and online love gurus to look for consistency while dating- is he messaging daily, does he sound equally interested every time, is he keeping his word about things he said he will do, are his words and actions matching consistently, etc etc. It all sounds great and so I and my friends have always used it to filter guys out. The ones that dropped on messaging a few times were out, the ones who started out sounding super into us but lost their mojo somewhere were again dropped, if he said he'll call by a certain time and then he didn't, he was definitely out etc etc. We thought we were doing good but over time I can't help but have this gnawing sense of 'something's off' inside me. I have started feeling as if these parameters are so rigid that we have ended up cancelling men who were good but maybe not best in one area. I have started feeling that maybe we are so scared and fear-driven of some guy playing us or losing interest that we have stopped letting them be human. Some of these guys, who we cancelled, but who in some way or the other stayed in the orbits of our lives ended up revealing themselves to be the most loyal and nice people. Have we started cancelling people or guys in our case, too soon? is the expectation of consistency incorrect? But then again, sometimes I think the very opposite that isn't this the bare minimum that you stay in contact with us consistently? So I and we are constantly oscillating between, we're expecting too much and guys are also human and just because sometimes they're inconsistent doesn't mean they are not into us VS this is bare minimum and if he can't be consistent this early then he never will be or he's just playing us or has multiple girls on his roll.  
  
can some more experienced people please help.

t3_1nixa1d,Wandering eyes ?,"I 24F have been dating my bf 28M for 7
Months now! We get along great and really enjoy each other! He’s one of the only
Partners I’ve had that my family actually likes and gets along with.

Recently we went out with my sister and her bf for drinks and it was great! A couple days later my sister tells me she feel as tho my bf might have “wandering eyes”.

I not gonna lie it felt like punch to the gut. She was sitting across from him when we were at the bar so she naturally had a better view of his face. She told me she could be wrong but it seemed like he looked at women that would walk by us. Granted most of the people around us were woman but she told me just to keep my eye out for it. I trust my sister and I know she likes my bf so she wouldn’t make this up.


I’m just not sure what to do. I trust my sister completely and she did say this was the one and only time she noticed this. This is also the first time someone has ever told me this as well. We are around my family and friends a lot and same for his family &amp; friends.

My stomach is sort of in knots because I would hate to feel like he was looking at other women especially in front of me &amp; my family. But I also want to be fair in considering I’ve never seen him do this and this is the only time this has been brought to my attention. 

Should I just talk to him about it ? Or should I try observing him? 

I have been cheated on before and the thought of getting hurt like that again is terrifying.

t3_1ni1ryp,AMITH for telling my boyfriends friend he’s been hurting me,"I (Sarah) 25 female (fake names) have been with Nico 25 male for about four months now. Since about a month and we have had a couple altercations where he has gotten drunk and screamed at me to either get out of the car and walk 12 miles home in 100° weather or pushed me on the ground. The pushing me on the ground has happened three different times and every time it causes cuts and severe bruising on my elbows and legs. The last time that he did, it was about a week ago because I asked if he would eventually want to move back to California with me and I would stay with him in the state that he is in for at least a year or two, but I did not feel comfortable, giving up all of my friends and my career to move to state that I really did not like after the argument. It turned into him screaming at me to get out of his car and I kept asking him to have a conversation with me after the conversation he pulled me out of the car and threw me on the ground, resulting in the worst bruises that I’ve had out of the other three times that he has physically put hands on me. His family keeps saying that they are on my side and I’m like family and his stepfather keeps saying that if he lays hands on me, he will end up physically fighting him. Three days ago we were at his family‘s house and we were all drinking, and I drunkenly told his friend what he did to me and showed him all the bruises on me and immediately that turned into my boyfriend screaming at me and telling me that just because he did it doesn’t mean everybody needs to know. His entire family proceeded to yell at me and tell me if I didn’t get out of the house. They would call the cops on me for trespassing and threw all of my stuff into trash bags and threw it down the Stairs. I think that his stepdad feels bad because he just kept telling me to go home and get some rest and I went home and immediately blocked everyone and the only conversation that I’ve had with them has just been me asking for the rest of my stuff. One last thing I forgot to add in the middle of them telling me to leave his mother who I’ve been very close with was screaming that she was gonna call the police and his little sister who I spent half of my day with and take on walks all the time also started screaming at me. I just wanna know if I’m wrongfor telling somebody what happened to me and maybe if I would’ve kept my mouth shut I wouldn’t be dealing with this. He says that he never wants to see me again and all I really wanted was to be heard and actually get an apology. Am I the asshole?

Update: please stop harassing me and saying that this is not the right thread to post because I am genuinely confused as to whether it is my fault for saying something about the abuse or not and for everybody saying that it’s my fault for staying with an abuser please stop because that’s really hurtful",[deleted],Alcohol/substances,High
t3_1nhi2y0,Did i hurt him or he was lying?,"So, I met this guy on an app. Physically, he wasn’t really my type, but he had written really interesting things, so I decided to give him a chance. When we met in person, he wasn’t very tall, but he wasn’t unattractive either. He had a nice physique, and we spent our first date talking for six hours, so there seemed to be a really strong mental connection. We talked about everything, including topics that are rarely touched on, and at the end of the evening he walked me home and we kissed. Already there I could see he was very physically attracted to me, in the sense that we spent two hours cuddling. He asked to see me again immediately and even that same evening set up a date for the following Friday.

In the days after, he texted me constantly, even in the morning. When I took too long to reply, a couple of times he sent additional messages, and when I tried to end the conversation, he would send more messages shortly after.

We meet that Friday evening, and he had booked a restaurant. As soon as I arrived, he jumped on me immediately, we kissed, dinner was calm, and then he told me I should decide where we would go for drinks. I said it was fine to go somewhere quiet, maybe a park, grab a drink and sit there. We go to get a bottle somewhere, and he takes me to his place, supposedly to get a corkscrew. He doesn’t actually go for the corkscrew; instead, he turns on these dim lights in the living room, and I realize that this was premeditated. He immediately tries to get close to me. I tell him I’m not sure I want to do it, and he says, “Look, this is my way of expressing myself, but I like you a lot, so if you want to wait, I’ll wait for you.”

Anyway, as the night goes on, it gets very late, and I can’t go home, so I have to stay over. He insists physically and performs oral sex on me, which I refuse to reciprocate. Sometimes I tell him I’m not in the mood because I’m not 100% sure. He keeps saying he really likes me, that it’s difficult for him, but he understands, and he is genuinely super sweet, staying close, touching and kissing me all night.

So I thank him for everything he’s doing and wonder how he can like me so much, since we’ve only seen each other a few times. I haven’t figured out if I like him the same way, and I’m honest about it. I tell him, “Look, I’m trying to understand, and there are things about you I like a lot, and others that I might not like as much.” We talk about the next times we’ll see each other. The next morning, I notice he’s slightly colder. He says goodbye, telling me “if you want, we can see each other next week,” and I go home.

When I get home, I notice he’s added more photos on the dating app and started adding girls rapidly. Clearly, I don’t intend to message him, but I was wondering if he acted this way because he felt rejected, because my hesitation made him pull back, or simply because he wanted something specific and realized he’d have to “work a bit harder” so he immediately started pursuing others. Or, maybe this flurry of activity is a way to compensate for feeling hurt in his ego.",feetdiva36,General dating / relationship,Low

t3_1nepi6n,Help,"So in July this guy that I went to high school with (graduated just last year) reached out to me and confessed he’d liked me since junior year. For context we had one class together and sat together for basically the whole year. I never thought of him as more than my friend cause he had a girlfriend, and I had someone that I really liked. Senior year came and we never spoke. But after we graduated he texted me suddenly (before July lol) and I found it sort of weird. I questioned what his intentions were but he never really flirted or anything like that so I brushed it off. I am actually sooo terrible at responding sometimes and I’m not sure why that is but every now and then I won’t respond to a text for upwards of a month. And if I’m being honest I’ll do that repeatedly ( I know I’m an ass, I’m working on it). So up until July we’d talk whenever I realized that I hadn’t yet responded. And one of those days in early July he told me that he’d liked me right. I wasn’t really interested in dating anyone but wasn’t opposed to getting to know him so I asked what he wanted to do. He said that he really liked me but didn’t like that I never responded. So I told him that I’d try and get better at responding if he wanted to keep talking to me. We talked for about a total of two weeks until I didn’t respond for one day. He lives on a military base so sometimes the texts won’t go through or something and so I thought he didn’t receive my message and I texted again just to make sure and he didn’t respond.

We had started hanging out and talking daily even before that and like we have had intimate spaces before that as well and were talking daily. But there used to be inconsistency in her communication back then.very late i got to know she was hanging out with her all this while. She says that they were platonic friends back then. But then when i find things on her phone it is otherwise. Later on confronting her she said there were blurred lines. Clearly on more digging i can find they were having aex back then and it doesn't seem like one off because he was continuously messaging her about it. They even went to a place like almost 8 hours for like just like that and what she says oh it was just like exes can be friends. And i was like shit. Clearly his texts don't look like that from that time but yes she said no to him always is what she says.

Later when we got into a relationship i can find her and his photo being clicked as they share a common workplace on me asking she said someone else told her and she finded it awkward to say it in between. Also one time i could not attend a concert which i was supposed to attend with her and few of her friends and she somehow was selling the ticket and he bought it. Which is super weird also one time i saw that one time one of her cousin came to the city and she had gone with her cousin and her ex to a place. To which she said the ex had to go to the same place that is why they went. Also she thinks exes can be friends inapite of us having so many fights over it.

t3_1n58v0t,Dating problems,"Hello, I just wanted some advice on this relationship. I met the guy online, aka he lives in the UK. I live in the US. He has already visited me twice, and we have known each other since June 2024. We started dating December 2024. He met my parents and lived in our house for a little bit. Which I found unnecessarily stressful as my parents would mention every specific imperfection he has. Which forced me to say it to him. I would also get in trouble a lot. I am also younger than him (18 and he is 22). My parents think he should have his own brain and decide what to do in situations. They believe that a man, if not able to fix something, is able to at least pay for something. But he does not have a university degree and is struggling to get into school in the UK. While I am personally am currently in uni. We also got caught with the deed because nobody locked the door, which was very scandalous. He also did a bunch of mistakes, like telling my parents that i have a car problem and not doing anything. (I am Slavic) He also took my first time. 

Now more about him. He is more of a let's settle this first before doing anything else. He really loves me. If I need anything, he will get it for me. My family didn't get along with his because they spoke badly about me at the start, which was not good. It also bothers me how everyone keeps mentioning the fact that he is shorter, suffers from psiorisis, bad hay fever, and doesn't have a degree when comparing me to him. It makes me feel furious and frustrated. I only agree that he needs to get a university degree because if he doesn't, he can't be with me in America and nor can I leave the country due to my status. 

The issue is the constant clinging that I am not used to. I heard a lot that girls would love an overly clingy/obsessed guy, but I dont feel comfortable. He has my whole work schedule all the time. We track each other on an app, and we both know who we hang out with. But every single time I get off work, school, or any activity, he starts spam calling me if I dont tell him why I am not answering. It's very annoying, especially when you are talking to your parents, coworkers, or friends. Constantly having to pick up the phone or eventually mute it. Sometimes, he doesn't understand that me not picking up means I'm busy doing something. (And this happens a ton)

Same issue when I just want my own time. Yesterday, I send him a text thinking he was sleeping cause of the 6 hour time difference and told him that I am gonna be on VR because I need to chill out and dance by myself for a little bit. He kept calling and texting until I started answering. He eventually said he also wants to get on. He got on, and I told him what I was doing again until he got off. I danced for an hour or 2 and then joined a female friend. This ended up taking a while because my other friend joined, and we started catching up on the game. He joined me again, saying he couldn't sleep. (I forgot to say he can't sleep most of the time without being on call with me), and we had an argument because another friend joined, and I jokingly called him annoying. As the conversation went on, he pulled me out again, trying to figure out why I wasn't in the other dance world. I explained I got tired, and the video wasn't working."" It was very tiring to explain that when I went there to relax. He then got off, and I told him I would drink a bit and again spam calls and texts. To add some context, I am not an alcoholic and I have a small drink every few months. 

We call when I drive, we call after work/school/activity, we call when I am hanging out with my friends, we call when I am studying. He only doesn't call when I am in class or at work. 

One more thing I dont like is how many things he promises to do, and he doesn't. We had an argument recently about his university admission, and I kept telling him he should get in no matter what because this was actually serious. And what about the promise of going to the gym? New job? Learning to clean better? Know just know how to do basic things... (The cleaning part i forgot to say... When he was over, I finally understood how dirty my room could be. He had clothes on the floor, on my treadmill, he sometimes peed out the toilet bowl, my bathroom was so dirty it was unimaginable and my car was yeah.... I told him to clean a few times, and he did, but I wouldn't call that cleaning) 

I just dont know how to deal with his clingy personality and his need to always take all my time. He gets sad when he doesn't.  I just need some personal space, and i already spoke to him about it. Recently, I also started having thoughts that we would actually not be able to be together if he doesn't get admitted. I dont know, I love him, but I am struggling. Please help.

He told me he don’t have much money and his other account can’t withdraw the out till 3 days later but he told me that the bill will take 14 days so it makes no sense. I ask him did he ask his friends for help he said he did and they are trying to help him. He say he thought that I will comfort him and told him that I will lend him the money so things got really heated up. He said that he knows that his friend will lend him but didn’t expect that I won’t lend him. And I said that he was gaslighting me to feel bad for the mistake he did cause directly after I told him to show compassion this situation happen and I’m not sure if he’s trying to use it against me. Am I wrong or should I stick to my words and help him out? Because in the past my exes always tried asking me for money to saying they have financial difficulties and end up I always have to lend them multiple times and I feel like an ATM I don’t feel like I can depend on them. I wonder if the reason why my bf keeps asking me to work so that he can borrow money from me or help him to pay for his stuff and pay for my stuff as well. Can anyone give me some advice?

t3_1n4x44z,should I (19F) break up with my (19M) boyfriend over this?,"I've been going back and fourth in my head for months about this. My boyfriend is an amazing man and perfect in everyway. He treats me like a princess and I couldn't imagine myself with anyone else. This post isnt necessarily about him, it's about his parents.

Were in college but he lives at home, I live in a dorm about 10 mins away from his house. You would think that means we would be able to see eachother all the time, but nope. His parents control everything he does. He has to ask to use his car (cuz they pay for it so it's technically not his car according to them), has to ask to hang out with me and they have and will say no. We could make plans a week ahead of time, and then day of his parents decide they dont want him to go. I have cried and have had so many panic attacks about this. So many times have I gotten ready and was so excited to see him, just for his parents to change their minds. This happened all throughout summer too. Nothing is every for certain and im consantly left in the unknowns if I can see him. I dont know why they are punishing him for something, and he doesn't either. Yesterday was a breaking point because his mom had invited me to their house for dinner and I was so excited. I got dressed, used my best makeup and was all ready when he texted me and said ""nevermind, my dad said you cant come"". I cried so much and I just feel stupid for continuing to let myself get let down consantly. It's not my boyfriends fault, he hates it so much. He was so angry yesterday and was just saying how badly he wants to move out and he is planning on getting an apartment next semester. He hates how controlling his parents are and he doesn't get it. Thats why I feel like im in a pickle. Idk if I should save myself from the constant let downs and heartache by just ending it, or stick it out because I do see a future with him and do love him so much, and I am his person and in his words ""his only happiness rn"". He doesnt want this, so I dont think it's fair to blame him or end it but god, I cant keep putting up with his parents. It gives me so much anxiety and I just dont know what to do anymore.",MathematicianSilver3,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1n0wgqw,I am genuinely so lost,"m a 16F and my boyfriend is 16M. Before you say it, yes, I know i’m young but I still need advice reguardless of my age. We’ve been together since 8th grade and we’ve had some fallouts, the longest one being 9 months. We always found our way back to eachother. We got back together for the second time in december of last year. Everything has felt great till the last month ish. He blows me off constantly, he doesn’t ask to call, he doesn’t ever make plans, he claims he’ll buy me flowers and never does, etc. My parents tell me we have nothing in common and the only thing we do is go out and get food (which is true) I love skiing and the beach, he likes neither. Whenever we hangout we just sit in my room and I’m just kinda done with it. I wanna go out and do something but he just doesn’t. I have so much love for him and I physically could not picture him with anyone else and what makes it worse is we go to the same school. we have three classes together and I cannot escape him. I really don’t know what to do and I know there’s someone out there who would buy me flowers just because and suprise me and make me feel prioritized but I just don’t know what to do or how to handle my emotions that i’m keeping balled up to myself, my bestfriend and my mom.

Summed up: I love my boyfriend and all we’ve known is eachother for years, I just don’t think he treats me right or prioritizes me and I’ve had multiple talks about this with him and he claims he’ll change but he never does.

t3_1n0pr3l,A weird dynamic!,"I am 35(F), started talking to this guy (38) last year. We met through a matrimonial website so it wasn’t a usual dating setup We had great first 2 dates. He would initiate, plan, be excited etc etc. Between the 2nd &amp; the 3rd date there was a month’s gap as he fell sick &amp; we got pretty emotionally close at that time. He lives alone so we chatted a lot during that time, i would suggest him movies, or ask about his meds. And he literally seemed like he lived for that affection. He had been staying alone in the city since he was 18. He is into sales and a an amazing conversationalist.. something that attracts me to him. I am a person who needs constant mental stimulation and he is great at that. Never a dull moment with him. And my emotional depth is what keeps him going is what he projects. There was this night he had to take some injections and i literally coaxed him to go to the hospital, checked upon him till he got back home &amp; he got pretty into me after that. The 2 dates after that were beautiful. After that he indirectly tried to gauge what i felt . It felt like it was an initiation to sext but since he didn’t say it directly i thought he was talking about my stance emotionally. Earlier he had told me he doesn’t believe in hookups because he has done it and he needs some emotional intimacy first. Which i was pretty ok with honestly. So i told him i was also kinda into him but i didn’t rly start sexting (which is ofcourse not v comfortable for a woman to initiate). After that convo, things started to spiral between us. He would not initiate or be involved but just text once in while as pet his convenience. I had multiple doubts in my mind that what is it that i am missing because he himself never communicates what he wants. I expressed my liking to him but he said he wasn’t on the same page. He said he doesn’t just want to be friends. At that point i felt may be i am coming across as romantically shy which i am not for him. So i tried initiating touch. Like i held his hand during a date or texted about cuddling. But he wont lean in. He left my message on read. I just don’t understand whats wrong here. He says he wants to be more than a friend but if i try to get closer he wont budge. During dates there are moments of intense eye contact or in a random moment he pulled my chair so close to his i was left gasping. His romance is film like on point but when he starts and i lean in like lets say in a sext or actually touching, he wont build on it. He would pull away. I tried ending things but he would come back after 2-3 months saying he feels something is stuck. I feel he is just trying to confuse me and keep me in a loop. Does it ring any bells? Its so weird that he says he likes me but doesnt build on any intimacy. When i told him lets take it the traditional arranged marriage way then and make families meet he wont agree at all. It’s like he sets the bait for affection, emotionally or physically, but when i lean in he just pulls away. And it’s heartbreaking. So i tried to go no contact on social media and real life too but he wont tolerate that, then he would message me to talk again. Say that he cant move on. There’s another red flag, he refuses to talk about his past at all saying that those instances kind of left him in an emotional wreck so he doesnt want to talk about it. Sometimes it feels like a power dynamic, he is pretty successful, with him i feel all my affection is on display but he never leans in. Just says he wants more, but when i give it, he kind of pulls back. Is he just an avoidant? ",[deleted],Mixed signals,High
t3_1mz6y39,Super Swiped on Bumble,"Okay so here’s the situation: I super swiped on this guy on Bumble under the “Similar Interests” section. I’ve seen his profile before and already knew I liked him. But I’m not sure he’s even active on Bumble anymore because… no match.

I followed him on Instagram since he has username in his profile. He’s public, verified, and seems super normal and cool. Now I’m just sitting here like… what now?

I want to talk to him but I don’t want to come off as weird or intense. We haven’t matched on Bumble, so sliding into his DMs feels a little bold. Should I reply to a story if he posts one? Like a few pics and wait? Or just shoot my shot and say something casual?

t3_1mwwnh9,How long is normal to wait for sex in a ldr?,"I (27F) am dating my bf (25M) and we have been together for a couple of months. 

We met online and he lives like 7-8 hours away by car. We started out as friends and he almost immediately made it known that he kinda liked me. I told him that I saw him as a friend and don’t usually date younger. 

After a few years, we have grown closer and he made the drive to come hang out with me and some other friends in the area. We mesh a lot better in person and I’m having a great time. After he gets back home, he starts being a lot more flirtatious and started sending me pics of himself. 

I tell him that it’s a bit far and he made some excuse about needing to show me and that he’s hyper sexual and “knew I’d like it”. I distanced myself a great deal after that. 

He noticed, got pouty and apologized for it. I forgave him and things kinda went back to normal. However most of our chats after that turned into impromptu therapy sessions. 
He’d rant and dump on me about:  
• how bad his toxic friends treated him 
• how his ex hates him for breaking up with her? And how he should have done more, asking me what I should do to make her like him again? 
• how his dad loves his siblings more than him, and how to make his dad love him? 
• how to get his mom to remarry his dad, etc. 

I try to change the subject gently because jeez that’s alot…. But he’ll usually start crying and asking what’s wrong with him? Through comforting him, we grew closer???? Now he’s quite clingy and saying that the one good thing he has was me coming into his life. 

Many months later, he came to visit again and he asked me out. I’m not exactly sure why, but I couldn’t say no. I don’t hate him, and over the months, it seemed like if I did then it’d crush him and take him to a new low. 

So yay? We’re now dating? And he kept leaning in for kisses, I kept turning my head to make him kiss my cheek as I told him I don’t kiss that easily. He respected that and just gave cheek or back of hand kisses. 

He’s not back home and it’s been a couple months. He’s said “I love you” since before day 1 and has been sending more pics. Every time we talk, 60% of the time it’s either more life dumping with tears…. Or what he’d want to do to me physically. And heavily insinuating that he wants to do it the next time he comes to visit. 

I’ve dated 2 people and am still a virgin and don’t think I want to sleep with him on the third time meeting in person. I don’t feel comfortable enough. 

He’s had a basketful of sexual encounters and have dating over a dozen girls. He keeps bringing up how he’s hyper sexual and how he’d love to x,y, and z me. 

I keep telling him that I’m not comfortable with it yet, and every time I bring it up he says he “doesn’t mind waiting for me”. But with then go back to saying the same things again. 

Usually (based on my friends) couples wait like a couple weeks to months? before getting intimate?? But even though a couple months have passed, is it normal to have sex with someone you’ve only met 3 times???

t3_1mwr7sk,Should I text and old flame or see where the current one goes?,"So about 3 months ago I matched with a guy on Hinge. While we didn’t really hit it off super well on the first date, he’s really sweet, kind of nerdy, and very very attractive. Despite the iffy first date, I asked him to come over the next week and something changed, we had sex and the chemistry was off the charts. However, even though we live in the same city, he is not from this country, and was going home for the summer in a week. I went over to his house the day before he left and he even mentioned that our chemistry was crazy, and that he wanted to see me again when he came back. Then, he went home, and we haven’t really spoken since.

A few weeks ago I started dating someone new. He’s attractive, kind, easy to talk to and a really good listener. He kind of seems perfect for me, we come from similar backgrounds and we would make a lot more sense together than I would with the other guy. I don’t know if I have developed commitment issues in the past year after breaking up with my ex, but every time this new guy makes any sort of relationship-y comment I want to run in the opposite direction. The new guy definitely seems to think that this is heading towards a relationship, and this should be what I want, but I don’t even know if I want a commitment like that right now, and I can’t stop thinking about the first guy. 

The first guy will be coming back to my city at the end of the month, so my question is, what should I do? Do I keep dating the new guy (who seems perfect on paper for me) and see where that goes, or should I see if the first guy is interested in picking up where we left off?",ciggiesinthesun,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1mul3ga,"Need advice on texting/calling while dating, feeling anxious","I’d really appreciate some advice on this because I think it’s been a recurring issue for me in past relationships.

Looking back, my dating pattern has often been:

* Meet someone 
* Spend a lot of time together 
* Constant texting when we’re not together 
* Eventually the texting slows down 
* I feel anxious, we see each other less, and things fizzle out 

It feels like there’s never any real *space* when dating, and I’m starting to realize that texting might have played a big role in why things didn’t work out. Of course there were other reasons too (different goals, poor communication, etc.), but in modern dating the constant accessibility through phones feels like a huge factor. I also tend to make myself *very* available, even before I’m officially someone’s girlfriend.

Now for context: I’ve recently started dating someone I’ve known as a friend for about a year. We slept together back in April, and after a few months of occasional hookups, distance, and hanging out as friends within our friendship group, we both admitted strong feelings and decided to give dating a proper try. We agreed we’re not labeling it just yet but also not seeing anyone else.

We’re both trying to take things slow and healthy, after we have both rushed things with other people in the past. In person, everything feels great: we can be ourselves, we talk openly when something bothers us, and it feels communicative and genuine.

But the part that’s making me anxious is… texting. When we first slept together we messaged a lot for a week or so, but recently (especially the past month) it’s been pretty minimal. He seems like the type who only texts when there’s a purpose, not to keep up ongoing conversations. 

I can’t shake the anxiety when I don’t hear from him. For example, yesterday I texted him “good luck with work” and suggested dinner next week (he’s swamped with a big project and warned me he won’t have much time). He replied, “That is really nice thank you, I would like this for sure.” I reacted with a heart but haven’t heard anything since. Rationally, I *know* he’s busy, but emotionally I start worrying about his intentions.

Why does it make me feel so anxious when there’s silence, even though in person I feel totally reassured? How do I find a healthier balance with texting/calling while dating without overthinking or slipping back into old habits?

FYI i do have major anxiety and really trying to learn from it, so just need actualy advice with how to handle dating in a healthy way so i dont mess it up.

t3_1muctlw,"I'm not sure if he likes me, or if I ruined the vibe.","This is kinda stupid.

I met this guy at an bar event during the weekend. I'm a woman and we are both in our late 20's. I don't date much and usually don't go up to men, but for some reason decided to approach him. I got a really good vibe and thought we connected. We danced for a little bit and talked in between as well. I made out with him pretty heavily and it felt good and nice.

We exchanged numbers and seperated for a bit. Toward the night I told him to come meet me at this other bar that I had moved to and there we danced a bit more and was grabbing me a lot. Touching my hips and stomach and grabbing my butt a little but not in a way that felt predatory just like idk good vibes. We also sat down to talk for like maybe 10 minutes but then I had to go.

The next day he texted me and I told him that I had a pretty long and busy day ahead and ended not getting to really sit and be on my phone till like 2 am. I think because of the time and obviously how we met he must have thought that I was texting him with an agenda because he turned the convo sexual pretty soon.

This is where everything starts going wrong. I was happy to participate but when he asked for pictures I said ""I'm shy"" and I'm just like.... why would a grown woman say that? Why would I say that? Like yes I was not going to send pics because I well I AM shy and I don't really wanna yet, but I could have said it in a way that didn't make me sound like a 14 year old.

The convo didn't necessary end there and honestly I was appreciative that he moved past it without like being a sore loser about it, but idk. The vibe today was like I had to text him in the afternoon and I was asking the questions and keeping the conversations going.

I'm starting to realize that maybe I was wrong. I assumed that because we had conversations that seemed like we were connecting, he wasn't only interested in a sexual connection. Obviously it was part of it and I'm open to that, but now I'm starting to think that it might be the ONLY thing he's interested in and I'm a bit disappointed. He seemed like such a good vibe and while we were dancing and exchanging numbers and talking there was brief mention of grabbing coffee or drinks and getting to know each other. Do we think that was just saying what he knew I wanted to hear? I like to think that I can feel when people are being genuine, and he felt very genuine.

He could have lost interest because I came across ass childish when I said ""I'm shy"" or needy when I was texting him this afternoon. Idk it's literally too soon to worry about this. I mean I don't even know him and the fact that I'm even feeling like i need to know what it's gonna be RIGHT now is just like my me being a little bit crazy. I just like don't know how to navigate these things because I don't really date and I feel weird and childish and stupid and I can't stop overthinking about it even though I know it's literally not that deep.

Should I maintain hope that he might be actually interested in me as a person or just call it a wrap and focus on deciding if I want to go forward with this hook up because that's all it sounds like it's gonna be?

UPDATE

Literally no one cares but I just wanna yap to the world.
So a week after we met we were supposed to go an a date but he actually cancelled and I was like,
Well... There ya go. Pack it up. And I emotionally started moving on.

But THEN he apologized and asked me out again. 
I was a bit suspicious and wasn't really that into it anymore just because of how disappointed I was but I ended up saying yes because I just to give it a fair shot. 

I'm getting home from drinks and it was SO NICE. We had a lot of chemistry which is good because since we were both drunk when we met I was afraid that it would be different. Still not sure where this is going to go but hopefully I get to see him again.

t3_1mouz78,How do you handle it when your partner shuts down during conflict?,"My partner (21M) and I (20F) have been together for a while, with some rocky patches and a breakup in the past. We’ve been trying to rebuild and set healthier boundaries, but there’s one dynamic I’m struggling to get past.

Whenever I bring up an issue — even if I’m calm, respectful, and just trying to talk it through — he often shuts down completely. He’ll stop engaging, go silent, or change the subject. Later he tells me he felt “attacked” or that I was “blaming” him, even when I’ve tried to be careful with my tone and words.

He’s said that when he feels shame or anger, it’s hard for him to stay in the conversation. I understand emotions can be intense in conflict, but I end up feeling stonewalled, unheard, and like my feelings are invalidated.

This has been especially hard for me to navigate because earlier in our relationship, he cheated on me multiple times. We chose to try again, but the past still makes it harder for me to feel secure when problems aren’t talked through.

I’m not expecting every discussion to be comfortable for him, but I do think being able to talk through things — even when they’re uncomfortable — is important. When he shuts down, nothing gets resolved, and it makes me hesitant to bring things up in the future.

We both say we want to grow together, but this is a pattern we keep hitting. I’ve tried giving space, using “I” statements, and focusing on how things make me feel rather than blaming — but it still happens.

For context:
	•	He tends to process things privately and comes back later when he’s ready to talk.
	•	I tend to need some reassurance after an argument before I can move forward.
	•	We both have our own triggers and past relationship baggage.

Has anyone dealt with this dynamic before — either as the person shutting down or the one on the receiving end? How did you break the cycle? Is this something that can be worked on with the right approach, or is it a sign of deeper incompatibility?

t3_1mnakvq,Top 3 contributing factors to failed relationships/marriages?,"1. Poor communication. This one many of you have heard, but hearing the issue and knowing how to fix it are separate things.

To fix this issue, you have to be willing to have the tough conversations, not hide from them or prolong having them. This builds resentment which will destroy any love between you both.

It is also about speaking up in the moment.
Im not talking about making a big issue over something in front of friends, no.

Categorically a no no, keep your problems at home and defend one another in public. Even if you make it clear to them they were wrong privately.

Point is, get used to being honest and up front, modern culture is one of escapism and avoidance. 

2. Declining effort - an extremely common occurrence is a high effort dating stage and a low effort committed stage.

For example: Two people start seeing one another, they do nice things for one another, spontaneous gifts, certain acts or service etc etc.

They enter into a committed relationship, suddenly on one side or both (usually both) that all starts to dwindle.

Why? 

Because people get comfortable. 
They treat effort as a barrier to entry for love, not as something that maintains love.

Don’t stop trying because you bagged the partner you wanted, you want to keep them? Keep the same energy you had going into this.

Not perfection, consistency.

3. Outside influences - an increasingly common factor in the decline of relationships is the allowance of other people into that relationship. Friends or family having a say (usually friends surprisingly enough).

This is especially common among ladies however occurs in both men and women alike.

A real story of a real client to demonstrate this point:

A man was in a committed relationship for 10 years with his high-school sweetheart. 
Will not reveal man’s real name for confidentially reasons. Will call the man, John.

After 8 years of dating he proposed (they started dating at 15 so were too young to propose sooner).

She gladly accepted, they got married and moved to a new state.
They get their first home together.
The first 6 months of marriage were a dream.

After that, it started to decline.
They both worked in the day, he was a power line technician.
She was a stylist at a hair salon.

He started noticing her getting distant from him, more arguments began happening, she began having issues with things he did that before she used to love and appreciate. 

In some cases even began getting offended by those things.

In his words “it’s like she was becoming a completely different person”.

Fast forward into a year and a half of marriage. 

He comes home late one day from work as he had a job that day in another part of the state, early start late finish etc.

Comes in quietly incase his wife was asleep, only to hear her on the phone with her friend at work while they are down the phone to her saying, and I quote “ see girl he never makes time for you and is always workin, you need you a man who really sees you” along with other flurries of similar sentiment.

Important context: The guy works and paid for the house mostly, has only ever done right by her.
They also do plenty together. Trips to other states a few times a year, dates etc, he earns very well.

Long story short, she has worked at this salon for a year or so now and things have gradually gotten worse between them. 

It finally came to revelation when he sat down with her the next morning and it all came out. 

Her work friends had all been having their say on parts of their relationship, as she was open to them about it, they were all either unhappy in some way or had bad experiences or were simply terrible influences. 
All of them pushing that onto something good and in her mind has started to warp a good thing into a bad thing.

Fortunately they worked it out and realised neither of them had ever done wrong by one another and they needed to keep things in house from now on.  

However there are countless cases like this that ended poorly. More often than not they do.

The point here…miserable people turn something good into something rotten if you let them.

To conclude, if you nail these three things on the head, your chances of a happy and long standing relationship increase tenfold.

I agreed.

We constantly get teased at work for looking like we are dating, and A and I have had the conversations of why we think we wouldn't work out anyway, and I believed it, till now. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, we were having dinner at home, having a couple drinks, and got to talking about how I ""need"" to find a girlfriend, to which she ended up saying that if she was single, she would sleep with me. And then reminded me that she has a boyfriend and doesn't want this to change things. But how couldn't it at this point?

When I first met A, I thought she was flirting with me, and had considered asking her out, then I found out about the boyfriend and backed off out of respect. But the more time we spend together (going out to eat, cooking/hanging out at home, going to the gym, etc) the more I think she is into me, but I don't want to be a homewrecker and try to convince her to leave her boyfriend who she hasn't seen in almost a year.

She constantly invites me out to hang out with friends and family every weekend, even her family really likes me. Her brother treats me like a sibling, to which she says she loved. Her parents both enjoy my compnay as well. She has invited me to Grandma's Thanksgiving this year, and even a formal event she's going to in a couple months because she ""doesn't want to go alone"". Am I crazy for thinking there is more to how she feels even if she keeps reminding me about her boyfriend.

She even called me one night when some people came in to the place we work at and harrased her for awhile before leaving, asking if I could walk her to her car because she was so scared. Obviously I did, how could I not? After getting her safely to her car, she hugged me, which had a warmth to it that I have missed while being single.

More recently, I admitted my attraction to her, stating that it wasn't fair to her that she admitted what she did and I said nothing and held back. I tried to do it in a respectful way, telling her I'm not *trying* to change anything between us. Obviously if it does, that would be great, but I'm not going to actively try to sabotage her relationship.

When we talked about why we wouldn't work, it was on the basis of differing world views, wants and desires, beliefs, and it all made sense. We believe in different things, want a few different things out of our futures, and see the world differently, and I understood at the time that maybe a relationship wouldn't work between us because of that. But then I met her dad and understood something, he's a lot like me when it comes to mindset, his beliefs, his world view, and she loves her dad. And if she can love her dad despite their differences, then maybe she *could* love someone like me. I'm perfectly willing to accept and love her differences, but would she mine?

Some of those differences being the main one of where I one day want to have kids of my own, and she doesn't want to subject her body to that kind of changes, and would prefer to adopt. Now I'm not against the idea of adoption, I've just never seen that for myself, but the more I think about her and I, I think of the idea of maybe if we did get together, try a compromise of have one together and adopt another, if I could convince her of that.

During the night she said her brother treats me like a sibling, he's over here talking to me about the boyfriend, which admittedly, I know more about than even he does. But he tells me that there's a chance they could break up in the maybe near future, and that if I like her, I could have a chance with her. Is he rooting for them to break up and us get together? Does he know something I don't?

My best friend thinks that she is ""jealous"" of his relationship with his girlfriend (her friend), that when he talks about his girlfriend, that she wants her boyfriend to be, or at least, do what he does for his girlfriend. And I sit here thinking ""If she wants what they have, there's an option sitting across the table from you""

I don't know what to do here, do I stay the respectful friend, allow her to figure out that maybe her current relationship isn't going to go anywhere, or do I maybe push a little less subtly and hint at a possiblity for there to be an ""Us""? Do Iet things progress absent my input, or do I fight for what I want and what she may want but not realize?

I know some of you may come on here and warn me about the perils of dating someone who is living with you, that it could lead to akwardness, and I understand that, believe me, my last roommate was living with her ex, and after they broke up, both of them moved out. But I don't want to hear about that, because I understand the risks associated, I just want advice on how to handle her and all the mixed signals I feel like I'm getting from her.",No_Opportunity2859,Mixed signals,High
t3_1mkeq6o,Should i start a relationship before he leave for Uni?,"so, I've been friend with this guy for two years, he already confessed to me in February  but i turned him down, eventhough i did like him. The reasons were 1 my last relationship was kinda messed up. 2 He is leaving for uni very far away 3 I'm pretty insecure about myself.
But i did like him and we kept hanging out and finally i decided to tell him the truth today, becuase he leave in like 20 days, so i didn't want to keep this with me.
we talked and indeed,  he still likes me and we talked about dating but knowing it will be mostly chats and calls and we might see each other in vacations.
He is a pretty decent man, honest, focused, direct, he always makes and effort for my, listen to me (eventhough i really don't talk to much) and plan things I've only told like more than a year ago. He is sweet but he keeps acting like we are freinds joking hard and stuff like that.
He is shorter than me and that makes me quite insecure, but he is great, ofc he has flaws just like me. Etc.
The reason of this post is, would you recommend star a relationship eventhough in 20 days he is gonna leave and until December we will only talk through phone? Any advice?
Plus, he is gonna study medicine if that's relevant.

t3_1mc40bq,My girlfriend crossed the line after we argued about her coworker — and now I might face legal trouble from my past,"I’m 20M, and when I was a senior in high school (Class of 2023), I had a one-time hookup with a girl who was also sleeping with other guys. She got pregnant, and they assumed her boyfriend was the father — but a DNA test proved he wasn’t. After that, she never reached out, never came to my school or house, and I never heard from her again. I’m undocumented, so I stayed quiet, changed my number often, and worked hard to stay off the radar to avoid any legal or immigration issues. Fast forward — I’ve been with my girlfriend (19F) for a year now.

A few weeks ago, we had an argument about a 40-year-old coworker who was sending her flirty texts, emojis, and even taking pictures of her at work. I told her it made me uncomfortable, but she brushed it off, saying I was overreacting and that “everyone at work is just close.” We fought about it because I felt like she didn’t take my feelings seriously. Then, not long after this argument, she went snooping into my past.

She contacted one of the friends of the girl from high school and asked if the baby was mine. They told her yes — just based on gossip. Now my name is back in circulation, and if the girl or the state digs into this, I could get dragged into a paternity case, ordered to pay child support (even retroactively), or face problems with my immigration status. When I confronted my girlfriend, she said, “It’s my business to know because I’m your girlfriend.” She keeps going back and forth — apologizing one day, then saying, “Well, if it’s your kid, I deserve to know.”

I feel like I’m the only one with real consequences here while she treats this like drama. First, she dismissed my boundaries with the coworker, and now she’s crossing an even bigger line by digging into something that could destroy my future. I don’t know if I can trust her anymore or if I should cut her off before she does more damage.",cerstinnn,Mixed signals,High
t3_1mbv46x,I cant stop thinking about it,"I just started seeing this man a couple of weeks ago, we met on the bus so its a pretty cute way of meeting. 
I would never walk up to anyone like that but its was really for my friend that tought he was handsome. 

Long story short he never met my friend and wanted to meet me insted becouse he said he liked my energy. 
He is big on peoples energy he said and a bit spiritual ( he was on a silent retreat a week ago and he still made the effort to write me and wanted to know how I was even if the did not allow beeing on the phone)

We only had 3 dates before it ended in anger and dispair. But the 3 dates was amazing and I really feelt as we had a strong connection. We both suffer from trauma and he seemed sweet and empatic. 
He just got out of a relationship 3 months ago and said he was not looking for a new one right now. I said I was open to getting to know him and see where Is goes. 
He really seemed into me and for me its hard to find anyone I like or feel strongly about. I also have adhd so its hard for me on the apps( remembering to reply etc) so thats why I am taking this so hard.  

On our 3 date we ended up in bed after eating dinner and having a walk. I had my period so I gave him a massage and went down on him. After that he seemed kind of distant and says for the 3 time that he is not looking for anything seriouse becouse he need to be alone to work on this trauma.
I was feeling dissapointed over why he had to mention this everytime he saw me and that this was in his mind beeing in bed with me. 
I said that he should try dating around then becouse if ofcorse can be feelings with time. He then said he does not do dating apps becouse its to much for him. 

I was feeling a bit hormonal and sad becouse we also had talked about trauma and therapy. He asked if I was sad and I said no becouse I did not want to get into all that in that moment. 
He also told me that that his bigges fear was to hurt someone.
I asked if he was sleeping over and he said its better if he sleept in his own bed witch made my heart sink a bit more. 

When I got back from the toilet he was all dressed up in the sofa and said he was leaving in 30 minuts. The clock was only 20 at night and we had gotten candy to watch a move so I was stunned. I said just go now if you want as I could tell he did not want to be there. 
He then called me passive agressive for saying so. 

He all of a sudden started saying sorry then he said he sould never had said sorry becouse he did not do anything. It was like he was shock he even said that. 
We talked about that I feelt like his talk about not wanting a relationship everytime he meet me made me feel a pressure becouse I then have to think about that so much (should I date someone Else etc. 
he did not like that reply becouse saying that should take the pressure off. 
He also said the could feel my sadness in bed and that I should have told him i was sad when he asked. I said that its just our 3 time meeting and I did not want to share before getting to know him better. 

Then I tryed to hug him to make this bad situation go away. He said i was playing games and that he did not feel like getting near me and wanted to leave. He seemed repulsed over any body contackt in that moment. (Before that he always wanted to hug and cuddle me)

I just went in the kitchen and started to clean up becouse I did not know what to do with myself and he asked if everything was okey, i said yes im just cleaning. Then he just walked out and could not even hug me goodby or look at me while walking out. 

He blocked me on snap and havent replied my text about talking about this:/ 

I feel gutted and sad. I just want this episode to go away becouse before that it was so good. The best chemesty I had in years. 
Ive heard people say some men feel like they want to widraw after sex but this seems like more then that ofcuse. I keep replying this night over and over in my head thinking I should have done something diffrently. 

 

Should i try texting him in a few weeks or just let it go?

Met a guy on an app. Talking for like 6+ months. He lives on the other side of the country. Finally spoke about meeting. I booked a flight to visit him. He said he’d take care of accommodation. Flight leaves in about 2 weeks. A week ago he said hotels are too expensive and if I’m okay with an Airbnb. I said yeah. He said he’d book it by weekend. Then Friday evening he messages to say he’s having family issues and I may need to reschedule or even cancel the flight depending on what decisions be made next week because there’s a lot of family drama or something. I was / am pissed off but I just said hope it works out for u. Bearing in mind his mom and granny both live with him and his granny had a stroke a while ago.

t3_1mb1x4h,"Am I craving too much closeness, or is something missing in my relationship?","Hi Reddit,
I’m 19F and in a relationship (8 months) with my boyfriend (21M). We’re long-distance during the week while he’s away at university, and we usually see each other on weekends. I love him deeply, and I know he cares about me too. He’s kind, communicative, and there are no huge red flags. But I’m still feeling… off.

I’ve noticed that I leave our time together feeling more unsatisfied than filled up lately, even though I technically got to see him. It’s not about the number of hours - it’s the quality. I keep finding myself craving deep, present, unhurried time. No phones, no multitasking, no sense of rushing. Just being with each other fully, like talking for hours, cuddling without a time limit, dancing to music, or simply being. I don’t want distractions, I want connection. And lately, I haven’t been feeling that consistently, which is painful because it’s all I want.

Part of me wonders if this is just how life goes when people are busy. I keep trying to be “realistic” about it. But another part of me thinks… maybe this just isn’t the kind of connection I’m going to find in this setup or with this person.

I’m anxious-attached (working on it), and I know I can be intense emotionally. But I also don’t want to invalidate what I’m feeling. I don’t want to become numb to my own needs. I’ve been pouring so much energy into missing him, adjusting my expectations, and rationalizing things… and I’m starting to feel drained.

I don’t know if this is something I should talk to him more seriously about, or if it’s just me needing to manage my own expectations. But sometimes, I wonder if I’m ignoring early signs of emotional mismatch. Other times, I think I’m just being sensitive.

Has anyone been through this? Did it get better with time? Am I overthinking or is my nervous system trying to tell me something?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s been here.

TL;DR: 
I’m in an 8-month relationship with a great guy, but I leave our time together feeling emotionally unsatisfied. I’m craving deeper, more present connection. quiet, focused time without distractions, but I keep rationalizing his busyness and adjusting my expectations. I’m anxious-attached and not sure if I’m overthinking or if something’s actually missing.

t3_1m8fwhf,Should I date this guy that's slightly evil?,"Sorry if my format is unusual here. I never use reddit but this situation has me desperate.

For context, I (F 16) am pretty nerdy &amp; not particularly pretty, which means I don't have a lot of romantic opportunities. I'm going into my senior year of high school and kind of panicking because I've never dated anyone &amp; I feel like I'm running out of time. I've always been interested in relationships but I just don't have the social skills.

There is one guy, though, who I believe has been interested in me for a while. We met when he joined the DnD campaign my friends and I were playing at school. I was pretty much the only one in the campaign that got along with him, &amp; he ended up quitting when we were about to kick him out. He did stuff like murder friendly NPCs &amp; player characters when he didn't get along with them.

He has a really bad reputation in my social circles because of this type of stuff, &amp; my friends basically all hate him. He's also super Republican &amp; I'm a Liberal, which is another reason our friends don't like each other. He's said stuff implying he would shoot trans people if he could (I'm not sure if he was serious). Basically, he's bad.

After knowing him for a little while, I started to get the vibe that he was interested in me romantically. My friends backed me up &amp; said they also noticed it. We've barely talked since he quit our DnD group, but sometimes he does come up to talk to me specifically. He also compliments me a lot &amp; has said some suspicious things about an anonymous ""crush."" Initially this scared me because I was worried about having to reject him.

The other day he sent me a text asking if I was going to the fair &amp; asking to hang out. I interpreted this as him asking me on a date (other people agree with me). The weird thing was that I felt really conflicted about it. I really did have fun talking to him when we used to talk regularly, &amp; I can't help but wonder if I could influence him positively? (I know I can't ""fix him"").

Besides, we're both rising seniors &amp; we're on very different paths, so if we did date it would probably be for like a year at most. He's always been very nice to me personally &amp; the message he sent was really well concocted (not putting too much pressure on me but still being kind of forward). I talked to my family about it (because I'm lame) &amp; they told me I should do it to get dating experience.

I know that if we do date people will judge me a lot, but my friends did end up saying they were okay with it. As I was freaking out about the message, I ended up realizing that I wanted to do it. I'm just worried that my decision might be morally wrong (he has said some VERY questionable things). I don't think I'll get hurt, because I know what he's like &amp; I'll know to keep my guard up. Also, what if I'm just using him because of my own insecurity? Even if he's a questionable person, I don't want to hurt him. 

Even though I wasn't sure I actually liked him, I said yes to his message. Did I fuck up? I want to do it, but I'm still not sure I should. Am I letting other people control me too much? Should I keep pursuing this? I feel very conflicted.

t3_1m6iqx7,Do I still have a chance with this girl? - Any insight helps," started talking to this girl about a week ago, and even though it was brief, I felt a real connection. She checked all the boxes: kind, soft-spoken, genuine. It’s the first person I’ve liked since my breakup 3 months ago.

We hung out once. Her dad wasn’t thrilled — he wouldn’t let her go out with me, but he did let me come over and hang out with her outside her house. Strange dynamic, but I respected it. That night I called her and told her I thought she was beautiful (was too nervous to say it in person). She said thank you and told me I was the first person who ever said that to her.

The next day, I asked how she was doing. She didn’t respond until later in the evening — and sent me a thoughtful message saying she’d been thinking about it all day and felt we should stay friends. She said I was one of the kindest people she’s met, she enjoyed hanging out, but she’s not ready for a relationship. She apologized for “wasting my time” and thanked me for what I’d done for her.

I responded respectfully said I understood, that I wasn’t rushing anything, and that I’d be open to talking or being friends if she ever felt comfortable. Also had asked if she was maybe open to a call to talk.

That was Saturday. It’s now Monday. My message still says “Delivered” (iMessage), not read. She also blocked and unblocked me on Instagram, which confused me even more.

A few key things:

* She’s timid and said she’s never been in a relationship
* Her dad doesn’t support her dating; her older sister used to get into fights about it
* I think I may have unintentionally overwhelmed her, even though I had no intentions of moving too fast but I really wanted to hang out with her so I might have seemed pushy

I’m giving her space and not planning to message again. But I keep wondering:

* Was she just scared, not disinterested?
* Did I ruin my chance?
* Is there any possibility of reconnecting if I give it time?

In that time we met up one evening after a week of talking, spent the evening together and it went well enough for her to want to see me the next day again so we spent that day together before she had to go to work, I took her to work and throughout these 2 dates we kissed a lot, shared good conversation and it really felt like we connected. 

After I left to go home (I live a 90 minutes drive away) she messaged me to drive safe, etc, and we've been speaking since although she doesn't seem to want to commit to another date yet. She said yes previously but since cancelled because 2 days after meeting she became ill and said she still wasn't feeling better (valid) 

What I'm wondering is she mentioned when she was with me about another guy she'd already been talking to for a month but he'd been so busy they hadn't met yet, but she was interested in meeting him which I said was fair enough we were just on our first dates I can't expect exclusivity yet. 

So do you think she's cancelling on me to date him? He lives closer which is something she mentioned and I'm not like upset or angry if she is seeing him as well, I encouraged it and said she'd know who she wanted to spend more time with after comparing both options. All I know is I'm pretty confident she enjoyed herself with me, she said she felt safe and never had felt so comfortable with someone that fast before, so I don't wanna give up on it.

Bottom line is at the same time I don't wanna waste my time chasing a lost cause, or getting my hopes up. If she rejects my plans for next week again should I move on? Or keep talking and wait until she's less busy/available to see me.",rhysysqq,General dating / relationship,Low

He’s said several times that by the end of this year he won’t need to work anymore, and promised (like 5 times) that we’d go on a holiday once he has more time. But over time, he started to pull away – when he’s focused on work, he stops communicating for days. When he came to see me, I saw how he completely shut down and became distant under stress. One time we planned to have a call, but instead he went to a party, got drunk, and then went silent for 30 hours.

After that, he messaged me saying he liked me 10,000% in every way, that he saw me as his girlfriend, but that he had to “cut the line” for now because work was draining him. He said he’d take me on holiday (again), that he’d stay in touch and keep me texting, and that everything he was doing was for “our future.” I told him I understood and that I would wait. But more silence followed, more broken promises to call or message. When he did finally reach out, he just talked about how tired he was, how x people now work for him, and that soon “we’ll live like gods.”

The last time we saw each other was in late May. I’ve never caught him lying – things he said in the past usually matched up with reality. But emotionally, he’s clearly pulled away in the past few weeks – no effort to see me, no questions about how I’m doing, no interest in a video call. When I finally asked him if our relationship still made sense and told him I was hurt and confused, he replied:
“I do want to see you, but I let it up to you. I’m working on my/our future.”

I messaged him saying I understood that he needed to unwind, but that it hurts when it feels like he doesn’t care anymore. His response:
“I know. Just do what feels good. I can’t do more than this.”

And since then – 10 days of silence.

⸻

I’d really appreciate your perspective – is this how someone acts when they’re burnt out, shut down emotionally, and just in survival mode? Or is he slowly backing out without having the guts to end it properly?

It just doesn’t match the energy and intensity he showed at the beginning.

t3_1ly1irz,Why does putting in energy make people like you less?,"I’ve recently got out of a whatever you want to call it because I can’t say relationship bc he blocked me when I brought up lables. Despite that this isn’t the first time this has happened obviously the dating realm often feels like a loop. But one I will never understand is why I always feel like the second I let my guard down they know and leave? I truly think it’s dumb to change after someone breaks your trust and vulnerability and instead you should hold on to that pain and use it as a way to differentiate yourself from those who only care about themselves. I could never look someone in the eye and tell them I want to be them, pursue them, or anything unless I was 100% ready and sure and other people do not have that mentality. This puts me in a loop because I refuse to stop giving because that’s what I love to do and makes me happy and I refuse to change that because someone broke that trust. I know it sounds like I lose myself in relationships and can’t set boundaries but people often disrespect them or lie to me because they want to have sex. I get so confused because they put in so much effort and do so much and I like to reciprocate that. And I get so focused on matching energy I don’t realize that they arnt matching it and I start to question them and they leave (idk if that’s with this never generation of men who are unable to take accountability)But if 10/10 times that’s just going to make me an easy target and have people waste my time and money then what’s the point? I think it makes me pathetic if I change because those people changing and only putting their wants first hurt me so why would I recognize that made them awful and be like them? How do I keep meeting people that put in hella energy to get me and the second I give they pull back and make me look dumb? And how do I stray away from these people without hardening myself and having distrust in anyone I meet and making it there problem or mine? Lastly just to target one more thing, what about someone putting in energy and begging the same from you says “I should leave them right now” and not I need to try harder because they did?",Fabulous_fezzy,Boundary erosion,High
t3_1lwr00f,"I feel like I missed my chance with a guy I liked. I want to follow him on IG for closure, but I’m afraid it’ll come off as weird unless I follow his friend first.","I had a huge crush on a guy who works at my gym for about two years. I tried talking to him here and there — usually by asking for help with equipment or general gym stuff — but ultimately, I was too scared to show real interest.

He’s quiet, reserved, and a little socially awkward, so when he *did* put effort into talking to me, I noticed. He always greeted me by name when I arrived and left the gym, and there were several times when he asked how I was doing. But I often gave one-word answers like “Ok” and walked away.

At the time, I had just started a job I absolutely hated. I was exhausted and miserable every day. I kept telling myself I’d talk to him “another day,” when I was in a better mood — but that day never really came. He was also busy filling in for a coworker who quit, so sometimes he just wasn’t available either. There were days when we didn’t talk at all.

Looking back, I realize I maintained a very passive role. I was hoping fate would somehow create the perfect moment for us. There were times he seemed cold, and times I definitely did too. I’m sure I gave him mixed signals — like looking away and pretending I didn’t see him when I got nervous. Other times, I made an effort, asked how he was, said goodbye — but I wasn’t consistent, and neither was he. I also was more sociable and friendly with other people at the gym because I was so intimidated by him.

He left the gym about a month ago, and I’ve had a hard time moving on. I don’t think he ever really knew I was interested, and I never gave it a proper shot. Now I keep thinking about following him on Instagram as a kind of last-ditch effort — whatever happens, at least I’ll have closure.

Here’s where I hesitate:

* I found his profile through the gym’s IG, but the post was from fall 2023, so I worry it might come across as stalkerish.
* He seems like a very private person.
* I haven’t interacted with him in a while, and I don’t want to come off as weird.

I’ve been thinking of first following his former coworker/friend who also quit working there, but who I've seen work out from time to time. That friend is outgoing and sociable — we get along really well, and we always say hi and chat when we see each other at the gym. I haven’t run into him this past week though, so I’m not sure when I’ll see him again. I wanted to follow *him* first so it wouldn’t seem so random when I follow my crush — especially since he posted a picture of the two of them together recently. That way he would see that we had a mutual friend. 

**Do you think it would come across as weird if I followed my crush first, without following his friend first to kind of “bridge” the connection?** Or am I overthinking this?",losteverything2023,Mixed signals,High

t3_1lux8sj,Date For Tonight Canceled,"OK, I’m really rusty on dating. I was in a relationship for 4 years and I’ve really taken a step back from dating since I broke up with him about 3 years ago. I don’t initiate or ask anyone out or even say yes if asked out, unless I really like the other person. That being said, I don’t like a lot of people 🤣 The last few dates I’ve gone on, I’ve not had a second date bc I didn’t feel much there. I don’t need fireworks or a kiss or anything but the chemistry in-person was flat and the energy was indifferent or flat out disinterested, mostly on my end. That has been two dates, over the last 3 years since I’ve been single.

I’ve been chatting with this guy and I really like him so far. We haven’t met in person but when we’ve gamed online, FTd, texted or interacted otherwise the banter is there and it flows naturally. There are times when either of us are not up for a chat, and I feel comfortable not talking for the day. Anyway, I invited him last week to dinner (for tonight). We’ve been chatting on and off for about a week since then. I try to keep texting to a minimum if we haven’t met in person, especially leading up to the date. But yesterday the convo really hit a great stride, I double checked and he was still up for it.

I didn’t text today, which isn’t odd for us since we’ve skipped a day here and there. I did so with the intention of saving some convo for tonight. He just cancelled, with a good amount of time before the date, not last minute.

“Hey, I have to rain check for another night! So sorry”

Should I take this at face value or is this dating-world speak for “I’m not interested anymore.”? I’m fine rescheduling if that’s actually what this is. I just feel like I can mix up some cues sometimes.

t3_1lvfd72,Is he a red flag?,"Okey so I (16F) have been talking to this guy (17M) for some time. He always replies super quickly, like in matter of minutes. We talk for 2 hours sometimes. He's super sweet, trying to keep the conversation going, he asks follow up question, and when the conversation seems to be coming to an end, he always says something irrelevant just to keep the conversation going for longer (or at least it feels like that to me). But, he NEVER texts first. In the month of us talking, he texted first ONCE. A week ago, I confessed my feelings to him, and he said that he thinks it could work out, but he needs some more time to get to know me better. So I thought he will start texting first then, but he didn't. I asked him if somethings wrong and he said it's fine, he's just tired. The last time I texted him, he was super dry. I asked him out and he didn't really seem interested. It was just this one time tho. What should I do??",idkfdhjbf,General dating / relationship,Low

t3_1luaxqy,How to introduce my relationship to my parents? 20F &amp; 36M,"Hi everyone! &lt;3 I'm 20F and have been dating my 36M boyfriend long-distance for 8 months. Even with the age gap and distance, our bond is strong, and we’ve met in person 3 times. We consider the relationship serious and plan to close the distance after I graduate from college.

The problem is, my parents don’t know we’re dating or that we've met at all. I only told them about 6 months ago that I was chatting online with an older man from the U.S., and they reacted negatively but didn’t forbid it. They have the obvious parental worries: his age, my safety, etc.

I live on campus during the semester, so calling him is easy most of the time, but now that I’m home for the summer, I have to keep things more private. I'm pretty sure they still hear me speaking English from my room while we call, though.

Anyway, I want to let my parents know we’re still talking and that our relationship has shifted to friendly from romantic. My birthday is coming up, and I think it’d be a good chance to bring it up. I mean, they can't get mad at me on my birthday, right?

We’ve had a few ideas: He sends me flowers with a sweet message. I ask my parents to meet him over a call as my birthday gift. He gifts me something, and then something small for my parents as well.

The most important thing is, we want to be careful not to upset them or come off as disrespectful. We’ve tried big gifts before, and they didn’t work. So if anyone has advice, we’d really appreciate it! &gt;_&lt;

t3_1lsjxs2,I (19M) need help navigating a talking stage with an (18M) international student – is this worth pursuing?,"Hello. I’m here to get some advice and hopefully some guidance on what my next steps should be as I navigate a talking stage. There's a decent amount of context behind this situation, so this post may be a little longer than usual.   

I’ll start with both of our backgrounds. I recently matched with this guy on Hinge (M18), who is an international student from Burma. I’ll call him Henry. 

Henry decided at a very young age to move, study, and stay in the U.S. permanently.  It's honestly quite impressive and extremely lucky that he accomplished that. He stayed in Thailand for two years in between, where he lived with other Burmese roommates. This is where the story begins as it pertains to me. When having a conversation about past relationships, Henry told me he experienced a long 1-year situationship with one of his roommates. One that was filled with unreciprocated affection, emotional distance, and even the fear of being used for lust, which he said was a possibility. This relationship slowly faded away without a word. When I asked Henry why or how it started, he couldn't give me a clear answer. He said it all began when they were sleeping in the same bed, that it just kind of “happened” from there. 

I pondered this. I really wanted to know what the thought process was behind a situationship like this since I had never been in one. So I started thinking about his mindset as someone moving from country to country. Think about how lost you feel when you're away from your family for years, how lonely that must feel? You would do anything to get a chance at finding something reminiscent of a connection with your family again. So what do you do? You grab onto the nearest life raft, no matter the circumstances. And in this case, the life raft was his bi-curious roommate. Not out of lust, not out of sexual gratification, but for pure survival. Perhaps an unconscious decision was made by him. I’ll get back to this later.

In terms of my past relationships, I had recently gotten out of a 10-month relationship with a guy who was dishonest to his core. We broke up a week after Valentine's Day, after he ghosted me while I suspect he was with someone else that day. There was always pettiness and always an intention behind the ways he would communicate, directly or indirectly. It's like dating in survival mode. The only reason it lasted 10 months is that I was stupid and ignored all the red flags. So, after that experience, I didn't think it would honestly affect me too much. I thought I could separate myself from the pain and learn to ignore it. But, as I realize now, this is not the case. After knowing what it's like to be constantly lied to, I find myself overthinking way too much when it comes to Henry. Sometimes I automatically assume he means something different between the little cracks of what he said, plain as day. It's terrible. But I trust him so far. And I hold onto that.      

So after talking for a couple of weeks, we went on a date to his local Thai restaurant. He lives about less than two hours away and doesn't have a license yet, so I drove over to him. We had good chemistry, had the same humor, and everything went well. Besides seeing a large cultural difference in terms of food, we were similar. After this, Henry and I went to the park to play board games and just hang out. Things were going well, and we both enjoyed each other’s company. 

Something surprised me, though, as we were getting more comfortable with each other and more affectionate. He kissed me. Like a full kiss, not a peck. And I could tell that meant a lot to him. That he really felt something. And I did too. I also noticed he had an odd way of perceiving my affection towards him. And this is where his past comes into play. He didn't know how to vibe with small things like touching hands or admiring each other. He stared at me with a blank stare. Like he didn't know what to think, even if we both had mutual attraction towards each other. I’m assuming he’s been conditioned to either be emotionally distant or expect emotional distance from others, considering his past situationship. Maybe he doesn't know how to be appreciated. It could be a culture shock, too, which I’ll come back to.    

It's been a week or two since our first date, and we've both agreed to plan the second for late July or early August. We text and video call once in a while. But it's mostly texting. And our texting is the reason why I’m posting this in the first place. I find the way he texts to be off-putting. The texting is dry and often short in replies. I think there's a genuine inconsistency between how much he says he wants to talk or that he cares, vs the effort he puts in. The most prominent example I can give is when we were discussing our feelings. For him, when he mentioned his past and how potentially hurt he was from it. I responded with genuine interest and sympathy. However, this was not reciprocated when I opened up about my feelings. 

For context, Henry had made a comment on our first date that I was like “a clingy puppy,” which surprised me since I wouldn't have thought of myself as clingy. So just a couple of days ago, I sent him a message explaining my thoughts on why I would potentially be clingy. Without revealing too much, it had to do with my father and some concerns I had about him. It was personal and introspective. He responded to this in a manner that I felt was invalidating, like he didn't match the same emotional weight as what I was conveying, being vulnerable. He responded by saying “that’s a really sad take” and mentioned he called me clingy in a fun way and didn't mean for me to go into “thinking mode,” which he later said he thought was “weird but cool.” I haven't judged him for this because I know there's a lot of cultural and traumatic baggage that comes with the way he processes emotions. For both of us. We’re similar in a lot of ways.

So this is the question: How does this come off to you guys? Is it worth it to see things through? Is there anything I’m not seeing? I would love just any general feedback on this. Thank you for reading.

TL;DR:

I (19M) recently started talking to a guy (18M) who’s an international student from Burma. He has emotional baggage from a past situationship, and I’m still healing from a dishonest ex. Our first date went well, but his texting style is emotionally distant, and he didn’t respond thoughtfully when I opened up about something vulnerable. I’m trying to be understanding, but I’m unsure if I’m overthinking things or picking up on real red flags. Should I keep seeing where this goes?

I have a guy who I really like, who has told me he has been struggling mentally for the last month, which is when we last saw each other. I've told him I'm here for him, and that if he wants to take things slower than that's fine. But i'm struggling with the whole, not seeing him for a month thing (we live an hour apart from each other) and him taking a day, sometimes days to respond and when he does, its very just surface level. I'm trying to get to know him emotionally like I would any other early relationship but its like I'm putting in all the effort and he's just keeping things bare. Which I do understand, especially with his current issues. I just need advice with how to handle it because I do want to keep things going with this guy and see a future with him, but I just don't know how to stop myself from getting upset when my needs aren't being met. I know this sounds very selfish and I completely understand that.

t3_1lrtp2t,so I guess he is my fwb now?,"I guess he is my fwb now? But I keep having dreams he like falls in love with someone else and im sad af lolol clearly I have some feelings. 

Just looking for thoughts, the guy i have been hooking up with has been at the gym more lately and honestly a little akward. He definitely watches me alot and looks away all nervous, but then I feel like he is kind of avoiding me. If i am at the water fountain hes not there, if i am going to the dressing room he waits, if i am on the matt it some way he is on the otherwise of the matt lol 

**we have discussed this is a private thing abd we don't need to be telling everyone at the gym about it. 

So after the classes at the gym I usually message him that it was great to see him,  just to avoid any potential awkwardness. Kinda reinforce this everyone should feel comfortable all the time.

He always responds back. holds conversation okay through text but its not his strength and will sometimes just not respond. It is sometimes in the middle of the work day abd yesterday it was at like 9pm so I wanna be respectful but I don't understand this guy lol 

he never initiates conversation tho, via text or in person 

The last time we were together he talked to me alot tho! Told me about all of his jobs, the struggle he has with his puppy (i have had a lot of dogs just lost my most recent) so he was asking if it werid to throw him a 1st year birthday party i was like no lolol mine have parties every year, we discussed the difficulties of dating and the shear craziness that we deal with lololol

t3_1lpdfau,Does he seem interested,"I match with a guy on hinge, we texted for a few days on and off on the app, so I gave him my number so it would be easier to keep in touch. The only downfall is he works overnights, while I work 12s during the day (for now I eventually plan on moving to overnights for the pay boost lol but that is far from now) 

ANYWAYS when we text it’s fun, sometimes flirty in a teasing way and I think he seems kinda interested but then he goes dark for hours (I assume he’s sleeping) I know basic info and I sent the last text, but would it be weird to send another message? 

I don’t know him all that well yet but I’m hopeful that this can become something especially since he hasn’t given or hinted at anything pervy which is a nice change compared to literally anyone else that has wasted my time as I don’t want a hook up for a fling, I want something steady. 

But I’m worried maybe he’s just not into me anymore, sooooo should I text again or just leave it and move on? ",-boo_bear-,Mixed signals,High
t3_1lqh73f,Date a man with boundaries. Especially the kind that keeps his parents out of your relationship.,"If I could give just one piece of advice to anyone thinking about getting into a serious relationship, it's this: Date a man/woman whose parents don’t have control over their life. I mean it. I can’t stress it enough.I learned this the hard way.

When I was with my ex-husband, we had a strong connection. We made each other laugh, we worked well together, we had real love. There were so many good moments, and for a long time, I thought that would be enough.

But it wasn’t.

Because in the background, sometimes quietly, sometimes loud and intrusive there were his parents. More specifically, his dad. And I don't say this lightly: the level of emotional control and “advice” disguised as love was constant, invasive, and exhausting. His father would send him these long, unsolicited emails picking apart our relationship, questioning my values, my culture, even whether I could truly “fit in” with their version of what a partner for their son should look like. He wrapped it all in intellectual language and “fatherly wisdom,” but underneath it was judgment of me, of how I grew up, the place I grew up and the color of my skin. Rooted in judgment and superiority. It was dehumanizing.

Worse than the emails, was the silence.

My partner didn’t protect me. Not when his dad called me a “mutt” to my face because I'm mixed (black, white and native). Not when I needed him to draw a line and say, “This woman is my wife. You don’t speak to her like that.” Not when I said I felt unsafe, disrespected, and unseen. We went to therapy. He started to see it. He began to understand the weight of constantly being asked to prove myself while also being expected to stay quiet, polite, and composed. But it was too late.

I couldn’t bring children into that dynamic. I refused to build a family with someone who couldn’t—or wouldn’t—stand up for me. If a man can’t protect the woman he loves from racism, emotional manipulation, or guilt tripping masked as fatherly words of love and wisdom, how will he ever protect a child? A mixed race child?

We ended things after he realized he couldn’t please them and protect me—and chose silence.

And that’s why I say it, not with bitterness, but with truth: Date a man who has boundaries. Date a man whose parents don’t run his life. If his parents are camped in your garden planting their opinions where the boundaries should be…nothing will bloom.",kassisbassis,Emotional pressure,High

t3_1li6jed,Need advise about dating someone casually,"Hi! 25 (M) here.

I’ve been dating someone casually for some weeks now (around 2 months). We met on Tinder and since then we met around 5 times. He’s very busy with work and all that and it wasn’t the easiest to meet. 

We decided to keep things casual for now and see where things go (he’s also coming out of a long relationship). But I’m developing feelings for him - he’s really sweet and tbh I rarely feel such a connection.

In the meantime he has introduced me to his dad and his best friend. He told me that the fact that he has introduced me means something. He also says that they speak about me a lot, and I believe him because I saw that with how his friend acted the first time I met her. 

But I also realised he’s still changing his pictures on Tinder… I’m so confused now because I know we said we’ll keep things casual, but does he see any potential at all for us?

t3_1ljlirm,he couldn't meet up this week,"I just need advice on if hes not that into me

I just posted about him and some of you said hes really into me but he is probably a little nervous to show it because he keeps starring at me and he looks like he wants to chat but wont make a move. 

So I messaged him today to see if he wanted to meet up and he said wouldn't have the time this week. He did previously tell me he has 3 jobs, some landscaping, he works at our gym, and he is working at a bar in the evenings/weekends. Then was super honest about struggling to keep the lights on. I also have two jobs so scheduling is super hard for us. 

I'm just worried that this is him avoiding but he answered pretty fast and pretty honestly plus its not every single time, we have seen each other a few times. and if we try to make plans for then a few days out one of us cant make it. 

I'm worried hes not interested, but at the same time I just dealt with someone who literally tried to force me to meet up with him the same day because he was 'available' and i needed to hop on that lolol mean while im telling him im still at work and cant do that. 

what are everyone's thoughts?

EDIT: I told him he could stop in for a free burrito or something this weekend and he responded back really excited. He would try to stop in if he could. But he did come. The location that I work was crazy and the was a line allllll day lol so im not taking it personally if he doesn't show i know hes busy. But do we think I over stepped? Or he just went straight to his job after the gym? Also he was hard-core starring at me and just trying to send all the attention my way. ",qseft1468,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1lgepaz,Am I just insecure?,"First off, I gotta admit I am insecure but at this moment, I’m wondering if I’m the issue here or what.. 

My bf(31) and I (28) have been together and there’s been hiccups on the road where trust was previously broken. Now, he’s also not the type to be very verbally affectionate and when he gets mad it seems he shuts down and stonewalls and says things he knows would hurt me. He says it’s to protect himself from getting triggered or heart broken and I can see that. 

Recently I found out from a group chat that he met a girl at the driving range (with a bunch of other people and some common friends of ours). They added each other on ig and he messaged her to play rounds and they have another round planned too. She also asks to golf with him and her friends but one other guy (my bf and i’s mutual was not invited despite him being the one to ask for her ig first. She then asked my bf for his) I only found out about this because of the group chat. I told him I’m upset that there was no transparency and he said I’m controlling and insecure. That if it was a guy I wouldn’t have. (Which I ask him about new male friends that he makes too but idk why he never seems to remember those and when he did once then he said “wow you’re like this with men too? You’re really crazy”). Anyway, he screenshotted some messages back and forth between her and it was also talking about mobile games. Him wishing her luck and what not. She knows I exist. She has a boyfriend too which they co-own a property together. My bf keeps saying she has a bf but that didn’t stop him from cheating on me with a girl who knew me before too. And he was the one who told me of the phrase “just because there’s a goalie doesn’t mean you can’t shoot”. 

I guess the question or advice I’d like to ask is if it’s insecurity, what have you guys done to improve it? I’ve been told I just have to force myself but it’s not really helping. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this!

t3_1lelc9a,Feeling so discouraged about dating :(,"I (25F) matched with this guy (29M) on hinge and we quickly began chatting. We realized that we were both out of town for the next \~3 weeks and at first we just planned to meet up once we got back. But we kept talking during this time (not all day, but conversations mostly in the evenings, sending photos back and forth, etc). He told me that he was really excited to meet me, he wants to pursue me, sending flirty messages, and all around seemed pretty interested. I was super excited because I found him very attractive and we had a lot of shared interests. Tbh I think he was a little out of my league which is also why i felt so excited. During this time, I made it pretty clear that while I don't want to rush anything, I do want to date with intention, and he agreed. He also brought me back a pretty thoughtful gift from his trip...

Fast forward to when we are both back in town, he has a bad cold. At this point he keeps pushing off our plans but not really rescheduling? I was frustrated but trying to give him the benefit of the doubt because I couldn't tell if I was being too intense since we had never even met. I send him a text basically just saying ""it feels like you aren't putting much effort into planning our date so I just want to make sure we are still on the same page!"" and he basically just ignores it lol and doesn't respond to me for a few days. He says he wants to just talk in person and I agree, so we go on a date.

The was really good, we hang out and talk for 4+ hours, but he never brings up what i said over text. He leaves the date saying ""lets hang out again"", but when I say yeah what about thursday or friday because I am leaving town on Saturday, he says ""Im not sure of my plans yet"", so I already felt like he was being non-commital again for some reason. Anyways, I get home and he texts me how he had fun and we start texting kind of flirtatiously,, long story short he ends up coming over and we slept together that night. I think mainly there was just a lot of built up sexual tension from texting because I usually don't sleep with someone so quickly.

When he leaves, he says ""I will shoot you a text when I get home"", but I never hear from him. Didn't hear from him at all the next day, so at around 6PM I text him ""Made it to X?"" Because he was going to ""X"" town for a work trip that day. He responded a few hours later just saying yes and that he is going to bed. At this point, I am already feeling a bit insecure that he was not putting effort into planning the date and then he didn't say anything after we slept together :( I didn't expect much but maybe just a ""had a great time with you!"" text, just anything really. At this point I feel like my texts to him started getting a little insecure (probably because I was feeling really insecure) and I was kinda asking for some validation after the sex and he just acted dumb about it all.

Then the next time I texted him he basically just texted me saying ""this wasn't feeling good to me and i doesn't like the pressure and we cant see each other anymore"". Im not even sure how I was applying pressure tbh? Just by asking for some validation after sex and asking to hang out? I have just been feeling like I did something to scare him off, maybe my texts were too much and at this point he just won't respond to me. And I texted him a few times kinda crashing out which now I am embarrassed about because obviously he didn't respond. When I think back to our text conversations he did sometimes mention that he didn't like pressure (but in my mind im just thinking isn't there inherent pressure when you meet on a dating app, its not like I was asking him to be exclusive right away or anything) . But it is just so strange to me that his behavior is so inconsistent with what he was texting me prior to meeting up. And if he met me and wasn't into it, then why did he come over to sleep with me?! I don't know why I am so hung up on this, I cant stop thinking about it, and its making me feel crazy :( Tbh I feel kind of played and am bummed that I invested a good amount of time in him for him to not really give it a real chance? Idk, maybe he just wasn't that into me.",Winter-Fix-1208,Mixed signals,High
t3_1lbo0ub,Should I ask out my coworker?,"I (25M) have never had a romantic relationship. I'm not exactly introverted, but I'm socially awkward and anxious. I kind of just suck at talking with most people, plain and simple.

I've had a crush on one of my coworkers (26F) for basically 2.5 years. Haven't really done anything about it because I just assume she won't/doesn't have any interest in me like that. I've gotten a little better at talking with her, but mostly only as part of groups, and even then I still kinda suck. We occasionally play some games together, and usually it's just the two of us. I don't get any vibe that she likes me as more than a coworker, but another one of my coworkers, and the only other person at my job who knows about my crush, says he thinks I have a chance, or at the very least, ""I won't know until I try"".

Her last day at our organization is June 30th(about two weeks away). I signed the card for her leaving and wrote a little message, thanking her for getting me into anime and that I hope we can keep playing games together. This other coworker is trying to get me to ask her to see a movie or some other kind of date on her last day.

Last year, I had a breakup with my ex Valerie (27F, fake name) that really set me over the edge. During this period I remember feeling like I was walking on eggshells because I couldn’t offer much to her, and she didn’t end up agreeing on what we were at the end of it. A year later, having gotten over her I decided to start hooking up and going on dates through apps, mostly to get new connections.

Here I met Tristan (21M, fake name), who I’ve hooked up and had dates with. I considered him a good friend, but he clearly sees me as something more. I want to open that door for him but those feelings I had with Valerie are creeping back in. Part of me wants to stay single, but part of me wants to give it a shot. Yet all of me just starts feeling guilty about the whole ordeal for some reason. It doesn’t help that this would be my first openly queer relationship and I’m mostly closeted, I fear I wouldn’t be a good fit for his more outgoing, proud lifestyle

t3_1l76bdx,Idk if this is a deranged thing to ask advice for but,"I (26F) am I dogshit wage of about £26,000 in the UK. However I have over £60,000 in inheritance and I am going to purchase a house soon. My job is going very well and I'll likely always be able to find work, however my industry pays low unless you go very much higher, and the positions above mine are extremely stressful on top of the only slight pay increase. So safe to say climbing to a higher salary will be difficult. But I want this job in this industry, as I do it out of a genuine love for the job. I have recently had time off and gone off of my head, I like to be busy and I love work. I legit get a kick out of going into work and take pride in what I do itself. I work well over 50 hours pretty often so I do make some extra through overtime.

Is it feasible for me to try and find a man who wouldn't mind living off of my income predominantly on that kinda salary (strictly looking to be no kids so they aren't a factor)? I know its pretty weak so its not going to be the nicest biggest house I'm going to buy. But I'd love to share it with and support a man who works part time and funds his own expenses in terms of his hobbies etc and maybe contributes to one or two expenses for us both, however I provide all the main expenses and do the lions share there. I do not care how low of a wage he's got. A man who struggles with employment would be fine with me. I also care pretty little about looks, honestly I'm into traits considered bad or less attractive half the time anyway and don't get why they are so hated (short height for example).

But, would this guy respect me like do genuinely respectful guys like that exist? I want a part time boyfriend sooooooooo bad because I would love for a partner that takes care of the home a bit more (I would happily still do some stuff, especially cleaning as I love to clean, I just hate cooking and do struggle on weeks where I work say all 7 days). I would love to work just to support someone else who wants to work part time and dedicate a lot of time to hobbies or something. But I can't lie I am wary as I've known way too many women who end up with guys who are disrespectful jerks even though she pays for him (ie they have boyfriends who are frequently in and out of employment and the gf keeps him afloat during each period of unemployment yet he doesn't pick up any household chores, he just smokes pot and watches porn all day and then doesn't even talk to her nicely when she gets home type of deal). Again thats just what I've seen though and I recognise a sample size of what I've seen isn't representative. And hell I don't even care if he smokes pot all day that bad though I'd worry about addiction mental health etc from that, but what I'm getting at is that I want someone who definitely will talk to me nicely when I get home and will be reasonable when it comes to household labour division and still has motivation to do SOMETHING with their life even if its not job related. For reference, I've always been extremely attracted to men who like horsemanship, falconry, pigeon keeping, gardening etc because of this.

There is another hiccup with me as well. I do have issues with vaginsimus, so while I'm willing to have sex, it wouldn't exactly be the easiest thing for us at first. I'm also not feminine at all really I am hairy and I dress for comfort and I don't do dresses skirts makeup etc which I know tends to put guys off but I'm not changing that because I simply am not feminine and never will be its not who I am even if yes I'm a woman I feel the same way most blokes would feel about that stuff.

I'd especially appreciate advice from young UK lads if any see this. Do you think there is hope for a woman like me? Yes I know I probably sound very odd I am a weirdo but surely there has got to be a weirdo man somewhere who wants a dual income and can tolerate this? Or no? And if men like this do exist, where do you find them? Probably not the apps or clubs pubs etc because I mean I'm struggling to find one through those means?

He lied about saving $15k when he only had $6, didn’t get his laptop or sign up for his real estate course until many months later, and didn’t pay rent for about 5 months, saying he had to help his mom (though he did support me with food and chores).

t3_1l58rsw,My (23yo female) boyfriend (33yo male) wants me to get rid of my two cats before we get a new place together.,"This is my first time posting on here so I’m sorry if the story is all over the place. 
My boyfriend and I were together about a year and broke up around January 2022. A few months before the breakup I found one kitten in the engine area of my car on a cold night. I decided to keep her even though he didn’t want me to.. he was ok with everything at the time even though he didn’t like her, he dealt with it as long as she didn’t get on the bed. He says he is allergic to cats and it makes his eyes water and itch so I get that. Anyways, about three months after the breakup, I got another kitten so my other one would have a friend to play with. My boyfriend and I ended up getting back together in February of 2024 and we were not living together until February 2025 when some things happened with where he was living and he had to find another place to go. He’s been living with me and my cats since then and occasionally takes allergy medicine (MAYBE once a week). I will say that while staying here one of my cats knocked over his 55in tv and cracked it. I did replace it with a 75in but he’s still very upset about it. We live on my sister’s property and she plans to sell her house so now we will be needing to move within the next month. Now that we’re looking at new places he is insisting I get rid of my cats and don’t bring them with us to the new house. He said he is not going to be miserable or uncomfortable in a house that he will be paying half of the bills and stuff on. Which i totally understand but we were also raised completely different and he doesn’t look as animals like I do. I’ve never just gotten rid of an animal. If I get one I keep them for their entire life. Especially since my cats only have known of me caring for them since they were kittens. I also have a dog that sheds and he said it was ok for her to come no problem. He said he feels like I am choosing my cats over him and I don’t know what to do. Am I being selfish for fighting to keep my cats? I’ve offered to make sure I clean everyday and vacuum so there’s not a bunch of hair or anything. I’ve been putting the nail covers on them now so they can’t scratch anything and get used to them. Told him we can mount the tvs on the walls.. I’ve literally offered to do anything in my power that I can do to be able to keep them and make it work but he just will not go for it. I don’t know what to do.. basically this means we just won’t be able to live together until my cats pass and that will be years and years as they’re still young. I already do all the cooking, cleaning, dishes, laundry EVERYTHING. This man will not touch a dish and I have to tell him to take the garbage out while I’m doing a million other things and he plays his video games.

t3_1l6hdjl,Have I made it obvious I like my crush?,"Hi everyone,
I’ve been crushing on a guy at work for a while, and I need an outside perspective. He’s an intern and I’m a part-time student employee at the warehouse. Our dynamic has slowly changed, and I’m wondering—have I given enough signs that I like him?

Here’s what’s happened so far:
	•	At first, we mostly exchanged glances. I’d often catch myself staring, and when he caught me, I’d break eye contact with a shy smile.
	•	I used to say hi to him first, but eventually he started saying it first—with the cutest smile—especially when we made eye contact. The first time he did that unprompted really stood out to me.
	•	I complimented his haircut once and he smiled shyly, touched his hair, and said “Really?” in the sweetest way.
	•	I introduced myself once, and he did the same. I said, “I know who you are,” and he laughed and said, “You know more about me than I know about you.” Felt kinda flirty.
	•	I gave him chocolate once (tried to keep it casual since someone else was around), and I’m usually more playful and smiley around him than I am with others.
	•	One time, I asked if he was okay because he looked stressed. He gave me a soft smile and said he was just swamped, then made a light comment about the music I was playing.
	•	Our conversations are still short, but we’ve shared light, sweet moments—like when he joked about being a “professional” after winning a game and I happened to be nearby.
	•	I’ve definitely acted a little silly at times just to be near him, hoping he notices me (I think he does).
	•	He’s usually reserved, but when it’s just us, he’s softer—smiles, small laughs, glances that feel meaningful… or maybe I’m just overthinking?

I’m worried maybe I just seem friendly. I joke and chat with others too, so I wonder if my signals aren’t clear enough. I haven’t directly said anything, but I’ve really tried to show it without being overwhelming.

So—does it seem like I’ve made my feelings clear? Or would it just look like friendliness to someone on the outside? Any advice is appreciated ❤️",No-Tomatillo-3380,Mixed signals,High
t3_1l55q6m,"Women don't like ""bad boys"" they like confidence.","**Women don't like ""bad boys"" they like confidence.**

You could honestly stop reading this there and you'd already have the secret to getting the girl of your dreams. Just be confident. I know, obviously easier said than done but I'm here to help.

So what does it mean to be confident?

I can break it down in 1 sentence.

**1. Say what you mean and mean what you say.**

I know that quote sounds cool but let's really boil it down:

**""Say what you mean"",**

Often times men get caught up in what I call **the indecision whirlpool**.

You know in your heart you want to say ""Hey do you want to go out for dinner tomorrow""  
But your brain keeps coming up with objections:  
""What if that's too straightforward, maybe I should just say ""hey"" first""  
""But what if ""hey"" is too casual, maybe ""hey, what are you doing tomorrow""  
""I don't know, that may be too open-ended......""

Now you've been staring a hole into your screen for 20 minutes, with no date to show for it. Whole time you should've just went with the first message. Nine times out of ten, your first message is the best — because it came before your anxiety took over and started trying to formulate the best response. If you find yourself in this position, just breathe, and **say what you mean**.

If you got the date and you don't know what to say to her, just say what's on your mind, be yourself, and have a regular conversation. If there's chemistry between the two of you the conversation will flow naturally without needing to plan out your responses.

When you're setting boundaries in your relationship, say what you mean. If you don't want your girlfriend wearing certain outfits, **say what you mean** don't pussyfoot around it, then when she wears something you’re not comfortable with, you get upset — not because she crossed a line, but because you never told her where the line was. She's allowed to do whatever she wants because you didn't set that boundary. The ""bad boy"" sets that boundary, he let's it be known that there's certain morals, values, and ethics he has that won't be compromised for any woman. By the way I'm not saying control what your woman wears but whatever your boundaries are, let them be known and stand by them.

**""Mean what you say"",**

There's no point saying what you mean, if you don't mean what you say.

What does that mean?

Don't tell her you don't stay with girls that disrespect you, then when she cusses you out, you start giving yourself 1000 excuses why you should give her another chance. **Mean what you say**. Don't say you don't care if she has guy friends, then secretly build up resentment for her best friend Jerome. **Mean what you say.** If you just want to fuck, don't fabricate a relationship on the back of your inability to express your desires.

If you always **say what you mean and mean what you say**, you'll reap what you sow.

**You'll live in the fruits of your truth instead of the spoils of a lie.**

t3_1l2dagr,Why do I feel weird about being hit on/flirted with?,"For context, I’ve had 2 bfs in my life whom we lost our virginities to (except the 2nd, I can’t lose it again ofc) when I was in high school. One lasted 10months one lasted 3 years (+college). Not sure it matters but the last one ended because I was suicidal and needed my space and he wasn’t helpful in my depression era. 

I’m 27 now and haven’t had a bf in 5 or 6 years. I’m realizing I’m going to need another partner so I always keep an open mind.

I’ll never go on a dating app (it’s offensive) but I have asked guys out and such. I’m no wimp, I’ll make the move if I want. 

But I’m one who prefers to know you before making any sort of “could I date him?” Because I fell for lust in high school and that masked their unmatching personality which I later realized; not doing that again.  That being said I prefer to make friends with a guy first, which isn’t hard for me as I’ve always had guy friends. I’m also a laborer and like stereotypical manly things so I often can think of more conversation with men in conversation than women, so talking with men is *not* the problem.

*My problem is when it comes to flirting.* Idk how to respond to guys who flirt with me. I don’t think I flirt (not sure how as I’m not a very sexual person unless there’s someone in my life that makes it so, like a bf—I know, confusing, maybe even backwards, but hear me out), and I’ve also never been one good with complements. If it matters, I was a “very cute” and “beautiful” “adorable” typical blond white child with curly hair. Compliments nonstop, still never knew how to take them/felt weird when I got complimented. 

I’m a socially anxious gal in recovery—I have my social anxiety moments, but I also have moments now that do not bother me, like talking to a strange. But getting compliments? I freeze up, i habitually respond “thank you”, try to think of something to say but overthink my timeframe of responding and so I go silent and try to switch the subject. So being hit on is like 10x more challenging. I also have ADHD and possibly autism so maybe my lack of social understanding and just copying others responses is just what I do. And since I don’t see others flirt in action, idk how to respond to it. 

Yeah I know I’m likely insecure in some ways, as we all are. But I really want to get over this. I feel childish.

For instance, some guy who I’m chatting with online (local folk, found me on IG) has never met me before but has followed my public IG for around 10 years. He says things like “I like you” and “I’m thinking of you” and “I’d like to hangout and get to know you more” to which idk why I just deflect, but also I have honestly been busy. Being a laborer, and doing my own labor on my day off, not much time to socialize and relax! But a priority I know I need to change, since I have zero social life at age 27. Again, I’m not someone who if I look at you I instantly know if I want to date you or not. Sure attraction matters, but typically once I know your personality, you’re either more or less attractive to me. Because I want a long term partner to create a homestead and grow old with, not some fuckbuddy who’s personality if just their looks or their money. 

Is there any way or advice you could I’ve to help me work thru this uncomfortable feeling of being looked at in a positive light/flirted to?",asianstyleicecream,Silence as consent,High

I started hanging out with someone back in October, became “official” in January despite him never being on time, ever. We had a conversation about it in December and he seemed to want to work on it. However, it’s May and still happening. And I’m not talking about 5,10,15 or even 20 minutes late… very regularly at least 30 minutes but upwards to even 1.5… there have been several occasions I have sat in my car in a parking lot or his driveway for 20 minutes waiting for him - and that was sometimes after giving him even extra time. Many times he says “I’ll be there in 5” and 15 minutes later, I’m still waiting… 
we agree on a time and he consistently fails to follow through, I have brought it up in conversation so many times that it began to make me very upset that I had to keep bringing it up and I’ve lost my patience with it.

Recently though, I’ve become needy and scared he’ll leave or stop loving me. He told me today he feels like he’s walking on eggshells around me because I keep asking for reassurance.

The shift started when I went through his phone (I know, bad move) and saw he used to message lots of blonde, beachy bikini-type girls. Then I saw his ex on Depop — she’s super thin and has an amazing body, and I spiralled comparing myself to her. I’m an AU size 6, but he once said he likes that I’m “not super skinny,” which unintentionally made me feel worse. He also looked up a TikTok business/sales influencer on Instagram, Shelby Sapp, who looks like his type. He said he only searched her up for her sales content, but I felt insecure again.

A few weeks ago, his mum (while drunk) questioned whether I fit in with his family culturally. He completely stood up for me and she apologised sincerely, but it still shook my confidence.

I hate how I’ve been acting — I keep asking if he still loves me or if I’m his type, and I miss the confident, secure version of me. How do I shift the dynamic back to that?",[deleted],Repeated asking,High
t3_1ktuiu1,Please knock some sense into me,"I (F20) met a guy (M21) at a party last week and we really hit it off since then (as in deep talks until 5 am, just staring into each others eyes for a long ass time, some cuddling,...). I really like him and he likes me too. There’s 2 big problems though. He's gonna move away in 2 months. And I don't mean another city, but another continent. He made it very clear that he doesn't even want to try doing long distance with me, because he feels like it'll tie him down. But he really wants to spend the remaining 2 months with me. I also don't wanna do long distance, but I get attached and I know I'll be hurting once he moves away. Starting a relationship with a clear expiry date just feels wrong to me so what I would want is to at least try long distance and break up if it doesn't work.
The 2nd problem is that he is a pretty experienced person and also needs sex in a relationship. I on the other hand had my first kiss ever with him the other night and I never really wanted someone physically either before him. I'm more of the slow burn type. And I really don't see myself having sex with him in the next 2 months, especially if we're just gonna break up afterwards. 
We talked about it for a long time hearing each other out and stuff, but we came to no conclusion that works for both of us. Implicitly we've agreed on not starting anything. 
But that also doesn't work for me. Cuz apparently I get attached so quickly that I just can’t let it go. I feel like he was the first person in my 20 years of living that I actually felt something deeper with.  Literally all I could wish for in one person. I'm doubting our decision after not even 24 hours. I'm even thinking about just agreeing to his proposal of a 2 month relationship just so we can keep seeing each other. I'm way too invested after one week. Logically the smartest thing would be to step back, I know. But I feel like I can't take it. I don't wanna waste the 2 months we have left crying at home and mourning what could've been.
What can I do? How would you handle it?
Enjoy the 2 months with him even if it kills me afterwards? Go no contact even if it kills me now? Stay friends? Or is there any compromise we could find?
Please help cuz I'm going insane over here and I'm too embarrassed to bring it up to anyone who knows me T-T

t3_1ko9dep,Weird Dating Pattern (30 dating someone 5 years older),"
Hey Everyone, 

I’m trying to make sense of a pattern I’ve noticed with the person I am dating and would love some outside perspective. I just turned 30 and I thought of using some perspective from people who are in the same age group. 

Long story short, when we first started dating, he was super intense emotionally open, sweet, always initiating conversations, making plans, saying deep things early on. It felt like we really connected on a deeper level.

But over time, I noticed a shift. The intensity faded and was replaced by silence. If I don’t initiate a text or check in, I often don’t hear from him. It’s not necessarily a fight or cold shoulder. it’s just… nothing. Like the momentum dies unless I’m the one keeping it going.

I’ve tested this once, and he came back around 2 weeks later at the middle of the night saying that he doesn’t know what went wrong and he wants me in his life. Did this again for a month and a half, and then the same pattern started to appear. I stopped texting, and silence came again. Whenever I text, he responds but when I don’t, he just doesn’t. It could literally be days without hearing a single word from him. 

We’re in a long distance relationship and I’m invested and he assured me that he was invested in this too! He even brought up the topic of “marriage” which confuses me more about this entire thing 

He is sweet and loving, but I feel that I need consistency and some effort to feel safe in a relationship. If I am dedicating some time everyday in my life to talk to you regardless of how busy I am, I’d expect you to do the same. Have you dated anybody similar to him? If yes, how did that end up for you?

We started chatting daily, to the point where we exchanged flirtatious texts. He told me he likes me but cannot afford a relationship given the distance and we mutually decided to just remain friends. I started dating a guy in my city 4 months ago, he's the best guy I could possibly imagine and i care for him too. However, a major part of me still misses the online guy and i can't keep him out of my head.

t3_1kjoer3,20F wondering what to do about an insecure 18M I’m in a relationship with.,"So for reference I (20F) have known this guy (18M) since high-school. We met through a friend and had had a “situationship” that lasted a few weeks before I came to the conclusion that he was too young for me at the time and broke things off. Years went by and I dated a few different people. Ended up single again and through social media we started talking again We talked for about 10 months. During this time he explained he wanted to be exclusive but he didn’t want to meet my family or let anyone know we were dating. I was ok keeping things casual in the beginning and thought we were on the same page. 

So I basically was in a secret relationship with him. I hated having to lie about where I was going and such. Im pretty active on social media I haven’t posted anything about him on any of my platforms. During that time I got a few story replies and DMs from guys shooting their shots, I told him about it and out of respect for him didn’t reply to the messages. 

About a month ago he told me that he wanted to meet up for lunch. He told me his car was getting repaired so I figured I would drive to his house and pick him up. Once I got there he came out to my car and he was really angry. I had no idea why and he said we needed to talk. So I go inside and out of nowhere he tells me “I don’t trust you at all” and that I was “sketchy.” It caught me off guard since I’ve been really open about everything in the relationship and I thought our boundaries were clear regarding phones and passwords and things. He goes on to accuse me of cheating on him. So I unlocked my phone and gave it to him. He went through it and found nothing. 

He’s obviously mad and goes on to admit he was “waiting for me to mess up so he could accuse me of cheating on him.” I was literally to stunned to speak because this behavior seemed to come out of nowhere. He asked me why I didn’t block the guys on Instagram who messaged me and I explained that to them I looked single so they didn’t do anything wrong. I figured ignoring the messages was enough. By this point Its been months and I’m over the secret situationship thing and he told me he still doesn’t want to be public. He also went on about how I was “too independent” and “didn’t even need a relationship.” I genuinely thought that’s how things were supposed to be? Especially at this age I have a life outside of just a relationship.

During this he mentioned that he had trust issues because his ex cheated on him. So that makes me feel like it’s not really something I did personally.  He is going through a tough family situation so I figured the stress of that played into it too. He’s also violated my physical boundaries on more than one occasion resulting in me having to take morning after pills (which I don’t do well on) I do like him and think we would work well long term but him being immature and insecure is making me want to cut things off. 

The only reason I’m reluctant to do that is because I don’t know if I’ll be able to find someone else. Apart from this issue he’s basically everything I could want out of a partner and I think with our careers and lifestyle it could work. But it’s obvious because he’s younger than me he still has a lot of growing to do and I’m torn on whether I should make an effort to start seeing other people or no. 

I’ve never really had older guys ever show interest in me. I am pretty hyper independent so I think that just doesn’t appeal to them as much. I work with all women and don’t really want to go the app route so I know I don’t really have a lot of options either. 

TL;DR - I(20F) and (18M) have been in an exclusive relationship that hasn’t been public. (18M) accuses me of cheating, and tells me I’m too I independent for him and that I don’t really need to be in a relationship. Feeling torn because of lack of options, and always attracting younger, insecure men. ",Square_End_6477,Alcohol/substances,High
t3_1kiv6fp,Conflicted on whether to break up,"I’ve (F23) been with my boyfriend (M22) for nearly three years now, and I’m starting to question whether this relationship is right for me. This is my first serious long-term relationship, and while I do love him deeply, I’m struggling with the fact that I don’t feel much physical attraction anymore.

When we first got together, we really connected over our shared love of independence, the idea of having our own lives, our own routines, and not needing to constantly answer to anyone. But somewhere along the way, that balance has shifted. He’s become increasingly clingy and overbearing, and it feels like he’s lost the parts of himself that made him, him (his friendships, his hobbies, his personal space). It’s like his world has started revolving solely around me, and while I know that comes from a place of love, it’s also stifling.

On paper, we make so much sense. We want the same things for the future, we share values and morals, and he’s genuinely one of the kindest, most reliable people I know. But in the everyday reality of the relationship, it often feels like we’re on different wavelengths. We don’t share many hobbies or interests, and our personalities (me being more avoidant and him being more anxious, sometimes clash in ways that leave us both drained.

I feel like I’m watching him try so hard to hold onto me that he’s letting go of himself in the process. And I hate that. I feel guilty for even having these doubts, and I wonder if I’m being selfish for staying when I’m this uncertain. But the idea of hurting someone who’s done nothing but love me is devastating.

I’m just so confused. I don’t know if love is enough when so much else feels off. I don’t want to make a mistake, but I also don’t want to keep dragging this out if deep down I know something’s not right. I just really need some perspective and help",Dependent_Ad7129,Emotional pressure,High
t3_1ki5y6n,Confused,"I (32F) matched with a guy (31) on Bumble.

We connected very well and had really good conversations. He’s a lawyer for a company versus at a firm which gives him better hours but still very crazy. We really got into the bulk of our conversation last week (Friday night) and texted until like 3:00 am. Until then, we had been chatting a few minutes through the day / evening but nothing too long. He knew I was going on a 10-day holiday to Portugal that same weekend. Most of our conversation was about our travels.

Conversation continued the next day (Saturday) during the day and in the evening as well. 

He thought my flight was Saturday night and I corrected him and told him it’s actually on Sunday. He confirmed when I was getting back and I said on May 14. 

I teased and asked if he was wondering about my return to figure out when we could go on a date. 

He said yes lol. He asked if I was up for meeting that night for drinks. He acknowledged that it was really last minute and could be late but suggested a few bars we could go to. I said I would think about it and had to prioritize my 24H check-in window for my flight. He understood and to just let him know what I decided once I checked in online for my flight. 

I said I would meet him for drinks. 

The date went really well and we connected over a lot of different topics, what we’re looking for, even what we value in life. We closed down the bar. I had 1 drink because I drove. 

He walked me to my car and then asked if I wanted to continue the walk and just keep talking. We walked for another 15 minutes or so. I didn’t want the date to end either. It’s been a while since I actually liked someone even though I’ve gone on a few first dates this year. 

We ended up in front of his loft. He asked me if I wanted to come up and talk, have a glass of wine, or whatever. I said yes. We watched Girls (since he knew I was in the process of watching it) and an episode of Survivor. 

One thing lead to another and we slept together. I didn’t expect it to happen going into the date. I had the ugliest underwear on and didn’t even bother to shave my legs. There was maybe 2-3 days of hair growth. 

He was chatting as I was getting dressed and by this time it was maybe 4:00 am. He asked me out for when I get back from Portugal and I said I would see what my schedule was like. 

I drove him. 

I texted him around 1 in the afternoon the next day (Sunday, the day of my flight). I know he’s someone who really sleeps in so I wasn’t expecting much of a response since we were up so late. He eventually texted around 6:30 pm, I was on the way to the airport at the time. I texted him back once I finished checking and was at my gate. We continued conversation for a couple of hours and messaged him that I was about to board and put my phone on airplane mode. 

He didn’t text me all through the week until now (Thursday night, around 8:00 pm EST). 

He apologized for not responding to me. Said his message didn’t deliver but like we both have iMessage and my other messages to other people have gone through fine. He said he also had a crazy work week and that he hoped I was having a blast in Portugal. 

I responded saying no worries and that I figured I was getting ghosted by this point but that I was having a good time. He responded again, nothing crazy but a response. 

I messaged back with a short story of something that happened to me the day before and asked what he was doing next week (the week I’m back).

No response yet. 

Was he ghosting me? 

How likely is my theory that he was gonna ghost me, but didn’t want to feel bad about himself, so messaged me to actually end it, so he can feel better that he actually told the girl versus just ghosting her? 

Why else would he message me?",bananamilkmob,Emotional pressure,High
t3_1khmafv,No response to spicy picture.,"I 40F have been seeing a guy, 33M. It's very casual. We catch up once or twice a week. But, at the same time, sometimes we phone or video chat just to talk about life and our families. So, I would say it's somewhere between friendship and casual dating. 

We last spoke on Friday. He was busy Saturday, I was busy Sunday; so we didn't really catch up over the weekend, which is fine. Then, we got into the work week. Which, for me Monday and Tuesday are unusually busy days. I didn't hear from him those days either, but it honestly was not a big deal. I would have been glad to hear from him, but I wasn't unhappy not hearing from him. They were just normal days. 

But, I decided yesterday to send him a ""Good morning"" text with a little spicy picture. Which is not unusual for us to do. It wasn't even really THAT spicy. More sweet and a bit suggestive, if anything. So, I sent him that, headed off to work. 

I don't keep my phone out at work, usually. So, after I sent my pic, I didn't really look at my phone. I just figured, in the back of my mind that once he woke up and saw it, he'd probably reply. No big deal. So, then, it gets to lunch time, I look at my phone. Nothing. Hmm. So, my reasoning was that he (works from home) woke up late, went straight to work, without looking at his phone. Or maybe he just took a quick glance. Again...no big deal.

I head back to work, once again putting the phone away. It gets to the end of the work day. I pick up my phone, still nothing. No big deal, I say....he must have worked through lunch and not had a chance to check his texts. I'm sure that once he gets off work, and has time to look at his phone, he will send some sort of reply. 

Welp, here I am....almost a full day later. No reply. No response. Now, I am starting to get angry. Now, I am starting to think how I will react if and when he reaches out again. And trying to control myself so I don't say or do something I might regret. 



It also probably doesn't help that I have hit a bit of a dry spell when it comes to the dating apps. So, everything feels that much more amplified.

t3_1kh0dq9,need support,"Met a guy in December and we really hit it off. We’re 10 years apart, 32F&amp;42M. Hes legally seperated since July 2024 and was able to get his own house with the help of his mom by August 2024. I’m the first girl since his break up with his wife.

He’s a really good guy and also a really good father. His relationship with his ex isn’t good. They are always fighting about something. In my boyfriend’s defense, he just wants to do what’s best for the kids but his ex just doesn’t make it easy. For context, she asked him to leave and to get the seperation. They didn’t have a good marriage, but he always stayed for the kids and said he would have continued to if he wasn’t asked to leave.

In the beginning I didn’t care about his previous life and knew there would be bumps and we’d figure it out. But as I got into the thick of it with him, I realized how involved and messy his situation really is. He’s in therapy to try and work through it all. His ex doesn’t want the kids or herself in therapy. Probably so her wrongs don’t get outed.

He let his wife keep the home and agreed to take on their marital debt of 90k. Between his child support, mortgage, bills, general living expenses, and debt, he’s got his hands full. As a couple we haven’t had any weekend getaways, or even a nice restaurant since dating. We cook and eat home 98% of the time. I also don’t get to see my bf on the weekends because he has his kids (which is fine, kids come first) but as a girlfriend, it stinks that I’m still all alone on the weekends. We cram our time in together on the week nights and have sleepovers.

I’m worried about progressing my relationship with him because of the drama with the ex and the debt. It’s only been 10 months since he’s been a single dad, the dust has not settled with his ex at all. I feel like there’s a long road to go with that. Idk when they will file divorce maybe after the 1 year mark but again I really don’t know. The debt is heavy.

How can I be optimistic about starting a future with someone with all of this on his plate? He assures me that we will figure it out but I’m just not sure it’s realistic. I feel like with all he has going on I will have to sacrifice a lot for the sake of this relationship.

Breakup has been on my mind for a month now. It makes me so sad tho. I will miss him. It’s like right person but wrong time type of situation it feels. I know he will be very upset. But as a young woman, I have to do what’s best for me, right?",perfect_situation9,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1qujabo,Is this Operation over?,"I got a job working fast food over Christmas break. It was about 3–4 weeks, and I worked third shift. During shift change, I would see this girl (I’ll keep her name private). I ended up developing a crush on her and would go through the drive-thru mainly just to talk to her.

Every time I pulled up, she would initiate the conversation. She instantly recognized me since I used to work there, but we had never really talked before because she worked a shift I absolutely hated. Still, whenever I showed up, she’d talk to me, and the overall vibe from our initial encounters felt playful—like she was genuinely interested in the conversation. She even laughed at something I said, though I don’t remember exactly what it was.

I procrastinated badly. I really wish I had gone for it the first time, but I chickened out. I kept showing up, ordering something small, just to see if I’d finally do it. This went on for about two weeks, the same cycle repeating every time.

One night, I showed up in a different car—a truck instead of my usual one. She noticed immediately and said, “Different car? Did you finally bust the speakers in your other one?” (I have a sub in my main car and play it super loud because it sounds amazing.) I laughed and told her no, that I just decided to take my dad’s truck out for a spin. We talked a bit more, and again, the interaction felt nice.

After another two weeks of this, I finally decided to go for it. When she handed me my order, I got her attention and said, “Hey, I think you’re pretty, and I was wondering if I could get your number.” Unfortunately, she rejected me and said she had a boyfriend (or something along those lines).

Now I keep thinking that if I hadn’t procrastinated, I might’ve had a better chance if I had gone for it earlier—but honestly, that might just be my mind holding onto false hope. I don’t know if I was just imagining the whole situation or misreading it, but that’s where I’m at right now.  
So I showed up a week later—not to see her, but because I genuinely wanted a cheeseburger. I pulled up and went through the drive-thru, and she saw me. She came up and said, “Oh, you’re back in this car? What happened to your other one?”I said the other one doesn’t have as strong speakers as this one does, and she said, “Yeah, I definitely noticed.”

She then went inside, and I saw her talking with someone. After that, I noticed her staring at me through the drive-thru window. I was in the second lane, so she didn’t really have a reason to be at the window. I caught her staring like she was genuinely thinking about something—you know when you can tell someone is really in their head? That was the look on her face.

Then I’m assuming she sent someone else out to hand me my order. I’m almost positive she mentioned that I had asked her out or something. The team lead came out, and she knows me. She wasn’t defensive or anything—she complimented my car and sent me on my way.

So here are my questions for you all.

1. Why was she staring at me through the window?
2. Did I make her uncomfortable what's going on here?
3. Is there absolutely anything I could of done differently to improve my chances and is there any chance of recovery here and by recovery I mean can I befriend or anything?
4. Is there any chance at all she may of liked me or am I being delusional?
5. I feel it was my approach, should I of taken a different route should I of just said hey so I enjoyed talking to you, here's my number (Ill give her it on a note or something) text me id like to get to know you. Yk what yeah that probably would of been a better approach.
6. Did I fuck this up did I botch this did I do anything wrong?
7. Give me your overall thoughts on this as well please and what do y'all think happened on the final time I showed up.
8. Can we become friends?

I know it's a really long read and I really thank all of you for reading it &lt;3

t3_1qubfsy,Why does she do this and is she still into me?,"So basically at the start of 2025 and in the summer time a girl added me on snap who goes to a different school but my friends who are girls know her. I was at my uncles when she added me and when I got home she had asked me what I looked like and I sent her a snap. So later on we started snapping ceilings, then part of our faces, then filters. There is this one filter called “dog ears with glasses” basically it’s a filter with dog ears, glasses, hearts, and u stick your tongue out a dog tongue comes out. We started snapping that with our tongues out and she would sometimes send kissy faces (she still does both) NON STOP.

Then one day I got a haircut she told me it looked good and stuff and she gave me compliments and we said goodnight almost every night to each other (I basically knew she was into me). I never thought about actually talking to her and asking how her day was because I thought I didn’t need to and I was a pretty shy guy and didn’t have the balls to do it.

So later when school started back up we just kept sending snaps but now when she snaps me some days she snaps back fast and other days she takes hours to snap me back.

My friend told me I should actually start talking to her and I did. I asked her how her day was and she said it was good and she was really getting into our conversation and started texting me like I was her best friend, she was sending capital letters and everything in between. The next day I snap her and ask her how her day was she was a bit dry but I never thought anything bad of it but now she keeps responding fast and sometimes it takes her hours to respond like today. She mostly snaps me right after school or at night.

t3_1qtbkdl,Right to be upset or none of my business?,"I [33M] had a fairly intense, short lived situationship with a woman [29F] who approached me one night in a wine bar in my local city [UK]. 

The night we met was unusual and quite vulnerable. Likely helped along by the substances we were using, she opened up about being in love with a guy who had left her confused about what they were. From the start, she was very open about not wanting a relationship right now. Despite that, and despite knowing I’m a sucker for punishment who is attracted to unobtainable women, I still couldn’t help but try.

We met up a number of times after that and every time was wonderful.

At one point, I invited her for lunch. She was enthusiastic and said yes, but changed her mind a few hours later. After that, communication gradually slowed on her end and two further lunch invites were declined.
Eventually, I asked her directly if we were ever going to meet up again and she essentially told me that we weren’t.

Since then, I’ve bumped into her once and we’ve exchanged a few messages after agreeing to stay mates. That said, it never really felt like she intended to keep that up. Still, whenever we have spoken or caught up, she has always been sweet and kind.
About two months later, I opened Hinge and saw her freshly made profile, listed as “active today”, with her dating intention set to Looking for a Short Term Relationship but Open to Long Term.

That really bothered and upset me. It hurt that she wouldn’t just say she didn’t want a relationship with me specifically. At the same time, I know it should be none of my business.

She always responds eventually, but takes 12-24 hours between messages consistently
When I try to end conversations naturally (have a great day!), she asks follow-up questions and keeps it going
On the start she replied much faster than now
But it's her last week in Brazil so overwhelmed and busy?
She agreed to a video call, but deflected it 2 times before actually doing it
The call went well - pleasant conversation, she seemed engaged
After video call, when I mentioned meeting for coffee when she arrives, she said Yes, I would like having a coffee with you:)
This is her last week with family before the big move, so understandably emotional/busy
She posts stories spending time with family/friends but still takes 12-24hrs to reply to me
Asked about my job interview
Asked how I'm doing
We had video call
Said and agreed for coffee and date wines but that was before she went too busy mode.
Seems genuinely engaged when she does respond
Here's what I can't figure out:
Is she actually interested but just overwhelmed with a major international move and family goodbyes? Or am I a ""backup option"" she's keeping warm in case she wants to meet someone when she lands?
I don't want to over-invest emotionally if I'm just one of several options she's keeping open. But I also don't want to pull back if she's genuinely interested and just dealing with a massive life transition.
My current plan:
Keep responses brief and friendly when she texts
Don't initiate from now on
When she arrives and settles (maybe a week after), send one clear message: ""When are you free for coffee?""
If she gives a specific time/day: meet and see if there's chemistry
If she's vague (let's see, so busy): walk away
Does this sound reasonable? Any advice from people who've navigated similar situations?

Unfortunately we do work together, but keep in mind she initiated contact with me, flirting, telling me she was attracted to me, and saying we should make plans to hangout. The problem is, she always backs out of any plans we make, whether it was her idea, or mine. Plus she doesn’t seem to be texting me back anymore, but she still flirts with me at work. So I’m just curious, what do I do? And also keep in mind she has told me straight up she is interested in me, and continues to say so. So I’m just confused, she says “I’ll text you later” doesn’t text, “we’ll hangout at such and such time” we don’t hangout. Now I could understand a bit if I was the one who initiated all of this, but she did, and it’s not just me making plans, it’s her too. So any advice will help please.",breeder_chris150,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1qsv71g,Avoiding the friendzone,"So there's this woman from work who I got close to in the summer last year, she's a peculiar one who legit drops contact with everyone when she's overwhelmed, turns into a hermit apart from coming to work. She's a goof and a dork. But good god...

I have a busy life and have enough between work and other interests to keep me busy. I don't have the mental capacity for a relationship. Been there done that. She's told me she's had one relationship and it completely wiped her, said she's now more suited to being alone and focusing on career.

Anyway we really hit it off in the summer, spent a week of work shifts talking about shared interests. Few days later we met up for ""lunch"" but instead went straight off. Had some time alone. It all felt really natural. Despite me being much older. She said she thinks that's her new thing. Okay.

She became very forward and started sending me material, asked for the same back. Then she was chatting about when we will next meet up.

She had stuff happen in her life soon after involving family bereavement, extra responsibilities. Late last year I asked her out and shortly before arriving for the date, she texted to say she heard I got back with my long-term ex. I had to explain that it was surely someone at work peddling shit as I'd not been with her for a year.

She told me she just couldn't be the other woman. Date never went ahead, I said I'm not going to force anything, we texted a bit later. Respect to her, she showed character. Saw her at work the next day and we talked for a while, had laugh, but did not touch on what happened (or not) the night before. We spent the holiday season miles apart due to family commitments but parted for that on good terms.

Since the turn of the year, she's had to take on extra work due to rising costs and has been worn out. She rarely bothers with contact out of work, i.e. via phone. We're friends on Playstation and I notice her online on that most of the time when she's not at work.

Whilst showing some consideration, I don't want to get lost in the FZ.

We get on well, there's always tension. She shares details about her life, her feelings, her worries with me. We still joke, tease a little. I notice her glancing my way at work. I told her this week that I want to see her again outside of that place. We were up close and out of prying eyes at work. She was receptive but said she's got work and family commitments for the next fortnight and will have to let me know when.

Part of me is the soft lad here who is trying to give her some emotional space, the other part of me wants to just be direct and upfront. Take the bull by the horns. Now I have made my intention clear, I'm in a waiting space.

I ain't going to be reminding her ""hey now where's my ass"", but at the same time I want something to either happen or not.

t3_1qspnzk,Keep going or cut ties?,"Im (34M) and  have been single the past 4 years. After getting out of a very unhealthy relationship where I was treated poorly, my next dating experience was unfortunately surprisingly worse and mentally traumatized me for a year for reasons I won't get into (and im very laid back and easy going and never had any mental health issues EVER, so that says a lot). So after a negative view on dating for years I finally decided to get back into dating. I have always struggled in the dating world because its been engraved in my head if a guy approaches a girl they're automatically a creeper, so I've basically only ever dated people I've met through work or friends of friends. Everyone I know is always surprised im single, people naturally like me and I come off as very social l, and I believe I'm decent looking, but trying to strike up a conversation with someone completely unknown is just very uncomfortable for me. So I headed to the toxic dating apps where I swipe thousands to get maybe 1 match a month or 2.

Skipping forward I (34M) finally get a match that goes to a date (37F).  We've been dating for 2 months now and she is incredibly hard to read. She has been cheated on by a fiancé (the x, not together for 2ish years now) and she clearly has trust issues and understandably so, that would absolutely destroy me and make me stand offish as well. But I initiate basically every time we do anything together and get virtually no physical affection shown towards me at all. But she'll text me morning, we cook together, have a show we watch only together and for the holidays I even helped put up her Christmas lights and got a tree and decorated it with her (things I feel like would be done with a significant other). I find myself craving for any sort of physical/emotional attention from her and I've never been like that before dating someone.

I decided to ask her straight forwarsly where we stand because she is so hard to read and I got a very vague response. I basically said I haven't been using the dating apps or talking to anyone else or feel the need to and want to know if we're just dating or would be considered in a relationship, I got a very vague response that she is ""not actively using the apps"" (which i find very weirdly worded) and shes seeing where this goes. So I've been giving her the benefit of the doubt that maybe shes hesitant from being cheated on or if this is just how she naturally is and I can't gague that at all. Should I continue dating her and see if she opens up towards me more or just call it?


tldr: recently started dating after years off the game. Dating this girl for 2 months who has trust issues but I initiate everytime we hangout and she doesn't show me and physical/emotional attention and I really like her and feel myself craving that from her. I asked if we're just dating or considered in a relationship and got a very vague response basically her saying seeing where this goes. I dont know if shes like this because her guard is up or this is just how she is and shes hard to read/acknowledges it. Do I keep trying or move on?",Frodo-Dodo,General dating / relationship,Low

This girl I’ve been texting for almost a month now, every single day, still gives me mixed signals. I comment on my observations of us maybe seeing a disconnect in some areas and it is shrugged off as “oh well we just need to hang out in person so we can see what all the disconnects are or aren’t” but then when I try to make plans, she’s always busy or foreshadowing a reason she will say no to an invitation. Some days we will text a lot, some days not as much. It is getting to the point that I feel like I’m being blown off, and when I voice my concern, she dismisses it. Is it unreasonable for me to not text first on purpose just to see what level her interest is at? Last night she said something that upset me and kind of made me think “okay this is over. Not worth it.” And then she double texted me and told me to have a good night. So this morning I wanted to text her, but I didn’t because I want to see if she has the humility to triple text to keep up what we have been doing.

t3_1qqld4m,How stupid would it be to attempt to re-ignite things with an old fling?,"I recently bumped into a woman with whom I used to have an intimate relationship, and we chatted for the first time in about a year. 
I had broken things off due to intolerable nebulosity and a lack of willingness to eventually commit on her part, and she became distant afterwards despite indicating that she’d like to remain friendly. 

The casual relationship was far from ideal at the time - a lot of strong emotion, and a fair amount of miscues due to very different class backgrounds and upbringings - but the past year of dating people from apps has made me realize that her combination of traits (her passion, beauty, intelligence, and charm) is exceedingly rare. Since we are both grad students, life is hectic, and I think I’m more receptive to the entailments of casual companionship than I was a year and a half ago, when I was so overawed by her (I was a late bloomer) that I couldn’t stop imagining and wishing for a future. 

I’m not sure that I can trust my feelings, and aside from her surprisingly striking up conversation (she’d seemingly been avoiding me up until then), there are really no signals she’d be open (she could be seeing someone new for all I know). Nonetheless, I’m wondering whether I could gradually build up to gauging her possible interest level again, or if I should just let the past be the past and keep moving on.

t3_1qp6y2a,Need dating advice if girl likes me,"W21 m24.  When we are in group setting things are great but if I can or text, I get silence. Now, if I organize a group event over text, she will chime into and attend.

Context: several months back she called me crying when a member of our team at work lashed out at her because we asked her to make changes. She (other woman) thinks all her things are perfect.

\*we work remotely but all of our mutual friends and coworkers are in the same city who we meet up with occasionally.

We talked for a while and I helped to calm her down.

2 weeks later I volunteer to speak for the team at the company meeting. Later she thanked me and said I spoke well. We texted back and forth and at some point she laughed at my joke calling it a dad joke. We then went back to what I think was flirting banter over text.

A week after we had a work event where we all dressed up formally. I complimented her on her dress but she seemed to ignore it.

A couple weeks after, our friend had a party and we all were there and talking no problem. When she got there she said hi and walked behind me, and ran her hand along my back before going to say hi to our friend in the other room.

Around this time is when I started to call and text her to invite her for morning hikes or meet for a movie. Always get radio silence.

Months later I reach back out to invite her to a Friendsgiving. Heard back saying she’s with her family down south.

A few weeks later we finally go on a hike. She mentions towards the end that one of her Roomates may be moving out and that the one who remains may have their bf move in. She also mentioned that because of this, she will no longer be able to walk around the apartment in nothing but a towel. Later she also mentioned that one of her Roomates is a real pain because they keep moving the appliances and the silverware all around the kitchen and she can never find anything because of her. At the end of the hike, we stood by the cars and talked for a bit. I got nervous and wanted to confess but decided against it since her birthday party was a few days away. Plan is to ask on next hike, if I can get a hold of her that is…

Her best friend who I hike with also, I can reach her by text or calling very easily. I am unsure if I should talk with her about this or not. Mainly because I think she may like me since she is always fixing her hair or playing with it or making witty banter. My only reason thinking she may not is that she has showed me previous some of the men she talks with on dating apps and they are 15- 20 years older than us. Think her type may be older men.

Out of the blue she did mention that the girl I likes into Asian men who are skinny. I am athletic and Hispanic. Not sure if I should pay attention to this or it’s because she likes me and wants me to not go for her friend and only her. Idk

Is she hinting that she doesn’t like me or is the distance a test or is it something else, idk

Also, when I was checking if she was going to come to the group movie night she said she wasn’t sure since she was on her period. She did come but not sure if this means anything.",Subject-Bandicoot682,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1qpz3gt,"What does ""casual"" mean to women in college? [22M]","So the title is a little misleadingly simple for a few reasons. But I (22M) just entered into a ""casual relationship"" for the first time. We met through a friend, and have seen each other a few times this past week. During one of these meetings, we had a conversation in which we agreed to keep it casual. The only problem is that I have no idea how casual works.

1. I recently got out of a long-term relationship (4 years), and based on my history I'm probably a serial monogamist. That said, casual seems like the right move considering my situation at the moment, I don't want to put that stuff on her. That history is a little out of sample at this point (high school, yikes), but I'm definitely feeling the urge to take her on nice dates and text her a lot, which I get the sense is not ✨casual.✨Also I've been very hesitant to spend any time on dating apps (as in I don't spend any) bc it feels icky.
2. Although she was the one to initially bring up casual, I'm a little worried she might not want that. Before we got together at the urging of mutual friends, I mentioned a few times that I should probably not get into a real relationship, and she struck me as someone who might be looking for one. I was then told by one of these friends that she was, in fact, looking for a casual relationship, but I'm slightly suspicious that this friend may have told her that's what I'm looking for and she's just ok with it. Or something.
3. In addition to *wanting* to text her a lot, we actually do text pretty frequently, and while trying to engineer some group activities with mutual friends so we could see each other outside of a bedroom without the pressure of romantic implications or whatever, things ended up sort of going that direction anyway.

Sorry for including my sort of weird spiral up there, but yeah. What is she likely expecting? I'm sure the first thing on the mind of anyone who's made it this far is ""have a damn conversation about it"" and while that's obviously just correct, I'd really appreciate some input.",Hopeful-Mix-2541,Alcohol/substances,High

We met on a TikTok live where she was asking for relationship advice after finally getting fed up with her ex cheating on her. No one was taking her seriously, so I stepped in and tried to help. She was really grateful, and we ended up talking for the rest of the night. About six days later, she randomly messaged me asking for my number because she was having a panic attack and didn’t want to be alone. We talked all night until she literally cried herself to sleep.

From that point on, she would invite me into her lives and ask me for advice. The problem is, she would almost always ignore that advice and run back to toxic exes or friends. She only dates online because she lives in a violent city and is scared of the guys there.

One night she opened up to me and told me she only feels at peace when she talks to me, that I’m the only one who’s truly there for her. That meant a lot to me. But at the same time, she never asked me out. She would give chances to guys she barely knew, yet if any of them had issues with me talking to her, she’d cut them off without me ever asking her to do that.

I started catching feelings but was terrified to say anything. I don’t think I’m very attractive, and I’m not financially where I want to be in life. Still, the feelings got too strong, so I told her I had a crush on her and made it clear that even if she didn’t want to date me, I’d still be her friend. She said she had a crush on me too… but after that, she became distant.

She still reaches out, just not nearly as much. I’ve told her how I feel, but I honestly don’t know if she ever took it seriously. I’m the kind of guy who struggles to move on once I fall in love. She was the first girl I ever asked out because I genuinely saw a future with her.

Part of me is scared to walk away because she’s been through so much. I keep telling myself she’s just healing, but at the same time, this situation is hurting me. I feel selfish even thinking about telling her that, so now I just feel stuck. And even if I do manage to walk away, I know I’ll always think about her. I really wanted her to be my person.

t3_1qacuub,How best to move forward,"I’ve been dating a girl for a few months now, we’ve been on several dates and she invited me to spend new years with her friends. 

The thing is, I have liked her since last June, and we didn’t start dating until November. It was hard to read if she liked me or not, she would give me signs that she did, but then would pull away. 

We had a nice date before Christmas and I realized she could be a potential partner long term. 

On New Year’s Eve we were out drinking with her friends. At midnight she kissed me on the cheek; I went in for a real kiss, she pulled back because she doesn’t like PDA, and later she joked about “leaving men in 2024 because they’re trash” while I was standing there. I was drunk and insecure, and I started acting jealous and possessive. I began hovering over her whenever she talked to any guy at the bar, which is completely unacceptable. 

Later she told me I hadn’t really tried with her friends, that my energy was off, and that my behavior felt possessive. I can see that now. I’d kind of decided in my head that I was only dating her and saw long-term potential, but I never clearly asked how she felt, so NYE hit a nerve for me. That’s not an excuse, just the context.

A few days after that, we went to another event together. Beforehand we talked about NYE, then I made the mistake of going back out with her and her friends while I was already pretty drunk and emotional. I went into “I have to fix this right now” mode, over-spent on drinks, and eventually blacked out. That made me even more anxious that I’d messed things up.

We finally had a sober phone call. I fully owned my behavior on both nights, apologized, and told her I’d like to keep seeing her but slower and with clearer communication. She said she had actually been leaning toward us being better off as friends, but that she liked what I said, felt heard, and that we’re “good.” She suggested maybe trying a sober date to see how things feel. We agreed to give each other about a week of space and then check in. She said she’s fine with either of us reaching out.

t3_1q9ku0k,Falling out with my best friend made dating impossible.,"So a couple years ago, I had a falling out with my best friend over romantic feelings between each other. Long story short, she had told me she wanted to explore feelings that she had for me. She had just gotten divorced for a variety of reasons that most would consider to be justifiable. Before anyone asks, I did not actively encourage the divorce. I actually opposed it at first for a time until the husband’s behavior became inexcusable.

She mentioned the romantic feelings to me while I was helping her move back to her parents. I didn’t initially know what to feel so I told her that along with asking her to take time to consider her feelings because the ink on the divorce papers weren’t even dry. 

After a while (couple months), we approached the topic again and then we started talking. My feelings became really strong in the couple weeks we’d been talking. Wed’d spent every day together since we met in some way, shape, or form. We had come to an understanding that we were ride or die best friends so the idea that we might be something more wasn’t that crazy.It was all going well until I went to go see her at her parents and she started acting weird.

Prior to showing up, she literally made suggestive jokes about making out in the bathroom. She also love bombed me twice on the 3 hour drive there. When I arrived, I couldn’t help but notice that she refused to make any attempt make physical contact with me. We’d been hugging since we met so it’s not like it’s a new thing for us. She was also really uninterested in anything I had to say. I couldn’t say anything about it because, at the time, her parents did not know we were talking. 

I eventually decided to text her to see if she was okay. I didn’t get any response. What made this an even bigger red flag was that she would check her phone every five minutes while  her text tone went off every 10. 

Eventually we all went out to eat and she rode with me. I had brought it all up to her and basically got an answer of “I just didn’t want my family to know about us because it’s only been about 4 months since the divorce”. I then asked who she’d been texting. She told me it was our mutual friend. 

When we were at the restaurant, I had caught a glimpse of her phone and that’s when my world came crashing down. She had been texting a guy the entire time. She’d been saying the same things she had been saying to me over text.

What followed was a month of trying to handle the fact that my best friend had been lying and manipulating me and my feelings.

Fast forward two years and I am still being haunted by our falling out. The problem is that I haven’t been able to get into a new relationship since. Everytime I try, I experience very similar situations that my friend put me in. I’ve even been told that the very reason someone was ending a relationship was because I mentioned my falling out with my friend. She doesn’t want someone to who isn’t over their ex. This was in spite of the fact that she literally asked me about my friend and spent 3 hours talking to me about her ex.

I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. If I keep the falling out to myself, a girl gets mad because i kept it from her. If I’m up front about it, a girl tells me I’m  not over her. I feel like I’m being punished for someone else’s mistake. Before anybody says anything about not  mentioning her as much, I’m acutely aware of the amount of times I do. It is painful to bring it up so I try very hard not to. Even writing it for this post is blaring mental alarms in my head.

Taylor and I connected through overlapping friend drama. I had been talking to someone else before Taylor, and there was some overlap before that situation fully ended. I know that part sounds messy but it’s resolved now and not the main issue. 

Taylor and I have been hooking up since July. I didn’t develop real feelings until mid to late October. The problem is that we want very different levels of closeness and commitment.

I am not ready to date or label anything, and I’ve been very clear and consistent about that. I’m comfortable with what we’re doing now. I’m also intentionally trying not to rush connections, which is something I’m absolutely notorious for. 

Taylor is still legally married to a man, though they’ve been separated for over a year and she has filed for dissolution. I’m not concerned about that part. She’s also newer to dating women, which I think matters here, not as a criticism but as context.

Taylor clearly wants more than I can give. She talks about really dating, future plans and increased closeness in ways that feel like pressure, even if it’s not meant that way. I’ve directly told her that pushing for more closeness makes me want to pull away. She’s acknowledged that she wants more and has said she plans to keep expressing that so there are no surprises.

There are also behaviors that make me feel overwhelmed. When she’s at my place, she follows me from room to room while I’m doing things, which makes me anxious. She’s upset that I won’t let her sleep over, which is a boundary I’m intentionally keeping. She also mirrors everything I do, which makes things feel transactional rather than natural.

I do like her and care about her, but I feel suffocated and guilty at the same time. I’m looking for advice on what the healthiest next step actually is. Part of me wonders if this is something I should end now before we both get more attached.

t3_1q5ab8t,"It's like pulling teeth to get my girlfriend (16F) to have a conversation with me (17M) about our relationship, please help!!","I asked out my girlfriend (let's call her Emily) on our first date a little over 3 months ago, on September 29, and we became boyfriend-girlfriend on our third date which was exactly a month after I first asked her out. Shortly after that date, she started missing school more often and she started having more days where she was in a morose and very down mood and then she told me that she had depression. She said that she always had it, but it gets a lot worse in the winter. In the next few days she just shut down, we used to spend almost all of our time outside of class together but all of a sudden, she got so much worse and she would be gone from school often, but when she was there she would be in these terrible moods and she'd barely make eye contact with me or talk to me so I had to learn how to cope with that and what to do with my time other than hang out with her. I always tried my best to be there for her and not abandon her out of fear, but it was excruciating to have to see her suffer like that. I quietly took on the role of selflessly helping her in anyway that she needed, but she's a pretty independent person and rarely needed me. She also benefits more from friendly care than romantic care when she's feeling depressed too so there really wasn't a whole lot that I could do to help her. What I wanted more than anything was to be able to sit down with her in a private setting and have a conversation about what she needs, and what I can do to help, and what her depression means for our relationship, but every time I ask her if she's available to hang out outside of school, she tells me that she's busy, or she's at her mom's house who lives in another city, or she just can't for whatever reason. It really killed me to not be able to talk to her about these things because I deeply value communication in a relationship, especially now with her depression, but I refuse to settle for talking over text about all of these really important things.

I'm not religious, but one of the only thoughts that helped me through this was the idea that god was testing me; I've always wanted a girlfriend and its taken me years and years of asking out girls to finally get one and now that I've proven I can get a girlfriend, I need to prove to god that I can keep her even through tough times like this.

Time went on for all of November and into December with little change. It wasn't until the last couple weeks of school before winter break, which started on December 19th, that I saw Emily consistently appearing to feel a little bit better and more herself. She also told me that she was going to have her brain mapped on the 30th and start TMS, which is a cure for treatment-resistant depression. I was elated by all of this, but I still felt a looming feeling of things-still-aren't-back-to-how-they-used-to-be, as that conversation I've so desperately wanted to have still eluded me. A couple of times, I sent her a short text asking her like, ""Hey, I don't want to hound you about going out with me, its just that I've had so much really important stuff I've wanted to talk to you about for months and I can't continue to be a low priority, I need you to take going out with me seriously, and help me to figure out a time when we can see each other."" And she would respond thoughtfully and say that she understands how I feel and that she'll have to see when she's free, but she doubts she'll have any time in the foreseeable future to talk in-person.

After my most recent text conversation with her like I was talking about in the paragraph above, I told her that I always feel refreshed and reinvigorated after our short conversations. I said that I thought that its because I get to **see** that she cares about me, not just know without evidence. I told her that I'd love to see her do more things to show that she cares in the future, like snapping me pictures of her face more often, and sending these kinds of texts to me if she has anything that she wants to talk about. After that conversation, she actually did start snapping me pictures of her face more often which I really appreciated, but she's since started to revert back to non face pictures. I appreciated the gesture, but that was the only thing she did to show she cared. I would've liked to see her get creative and use her own volition to do other things than just what I suggested, but that didn't happen.

yesterday as I'm writing this (1/5/26), the two of us along with a few friends hung out at one of our houses together, and it was the first time Emily and I had seen each other in like two and a half weeks, and I walked over to give her a hug when I got there, and she just gave me a weak one-arm hug without even making eye contact with me, she didn't even say goodbye to me when she left either, and we didn't talk a whole lot during the party either. I offered to give her a ride home so maybe we could talk a little bit in the car, but she told me that she was getting food on the way home so I couldn't.

I feel so thoroughly defeated by all of this. Part of me thinks, ""Why don't you just tell her that she needs to start taking you and your needs seriously and I can't continue to be a bottom priority, and that I don't care how she does it, I just need to see that cares?"" But then I remember that I'VE ALREADY DONE THAT MULTIPLE TIMES! I feel like talking to her about all of this is the only solution, but I've exhausted every strategy to get her to hear me that I can think of. I just feel trapped, I feel like I know the way out of this, but it's impossible to reach that solution. The conversation that I want to have with her constantly evolves, too. It's facetted and grown in complexity and severity of how I feel.

It feel like Emily is making excuses for why she can't hang out with me. Everything is an exception for her, and she'll never sacrifice anything or make any compromises to be able to see me. I eclipse that though, I would do anything to be able to spend time with my girlfriend and I'll happily make sacrifices if it means I get to see her because I really do love seeing her more than anything.

I've always known that we're gonna break up eventually, but recently I feel like I've been able to foresee it more clearly and inevitable recently, like our demise is not just ""some day,"" but soon. Breaking up and finding someone ""better"" is a scarily tempting thought that I've been having. I've found other passions in life recently, but getting a girlfriend has always been my true, lifelong aspiration, and I ran myself into the ground for years, constantly asking out girls despite my fear, and always getting rejected before I managed to get one girlfriend, and if this goes to shit then I'm gonna be back at square 1. Part of me wants to get a do-over with a new girl, but if I commit to that, who knows how long its gonna be and how hard I have to try before I actually get my second chance. If I break up with her, I'm also breaking up with my first girlfriend, and my first kiss, the first girl who actually **wants me** and someone whom I truly and deeply care about. God forbid, but if the best course of action for the two of us really is breaking up, I'm not sure if I'll physically be able to bring myself to do it.

I really need help here, I also just want to be able to talk about this. Emily has fundamental, relationship-breaking flaws, but also she has depression so she deserves a little patience. I wont even consider actually breaking up with her until after we've been able to talk and I've had a chance to say to her what I have to say, but I just truly don't know how we're supposed to do that, she just wont budge and I've done everything I possibly can, save for begging to get a chance to talk. I'd just love an outsider's perspective on this and I'd appreciate optimistic advice; breaking up is a last resort for me.

t3_1pyjtvk,First date with someone I’ve known for years. How should I approach it?,"I’m going on a date in a few days with a girl I’ve known for a while, and I’m not sure how to approach it.

We both attend the same church and sing in the choir. I’ve known her for years, but we’ve never been particularly close in person. That said, we have spent a decent amount of one-on-one time talking over text recently, so there’s already some rapport and comfort there.

She’s also good friends with my sister, so we’re definitely not strangers, just people who haven’t really spent intentional one-on-one time together in person before.

Most of my dating experience has been with people I didn’t know beforehand, so my usual “first date” approach is built around getting to know a stranger. This feels different because there’s already familiarity, shared context, and overlapping social circles.

My question is:
How should I approach a first date with someone I already know and have talked to, but haven’t dated before?

What should the focus be. Should I be keeping it light, going deeper, or letting it unfold naturally?

t3_1q2hm2f,"Being successful at dating in 2026 for a man requires far than just ""good looks"" and skills most men cant even fathom","Here is the funnel of failure most men don't realize they are in:

​1. The Threshold
First, you have to meet the looks threshold just to be a prospect. Most guys don't even make it past the visual gatekeeper. But let's say you do...


​2. The Queue
You aren't just matching with her; you are matching against 50–60 other guys who are crushing it.
Your banter has to outperform men who have way more ""reference experience"" than you. The average guy has zero clue how to text or sexually escalate without being weird.


​3. The Conversion
If you survive the text game and get the date, you have to escalate smoothly in person. Most lack the practice to do this.
But even if you get her back to your place, you have to seal the deal.


​4. The Performance
You need to keep her sexually satisfied and consistently reaching climax to keep her coming back.
If the sex is mediocre, she has a dozen other options on her phone who might be better.


​5. The Retention
Finally, you have to maintain a strong, dominant, masculine frame for weeks while she is still vetting you against those other prospects.


What's wild is how often men blame everything on looks while completely ignoring the stack of social, sexual, and psychological skills required AFTER the match.

t3_1pq3hyq,Need advice with a friend,"(WLW)

I (F22) have been ""kind of"" friends with a girl (23) for almost 4 years. We don't really talk outside of our bigger gatherings (beside some messages here and there) however everytime we talk she always compliments me. I am bi (been out since the first day we net basically) and she never said it openly, but another friend of mine keeps on saying to her to ""find a bf or a gf"" (literally their words).
The last time we met (around a week ago for a friend's birthday) she sat next to me and went on for about 10 minutes about she really liked the way I dress, and telling me how ""fashionable"" i was. She also said that she really like my perfume (said it was ""so me"" or something along these lines). This thing wouldn't be so strange, but the real thing that made me question her actual intentions is that she doesn't say anything similar to our other girl friends. This hasn't been the only time something like this happend; she said (around a month ago) how much she liked the pictures I took with her camera, how much she liked my makeup, and things like this.
Now, I really need some advice here: am I being paranoid or am I onto something?

There’s a girl I love a lot, and she knows it. At first, she was my client. Later, she asked to work with me, and I appointed her as my PA/PS. She works remotely from her home country, and I’m currently in another country. She’ll be coming here within about a month.

The problem is, even though she knows how I feel, she keeps ignoring my messages and says she’s “busy.” I’m honestly more busy than her, but I still find time to text her. At the same time, she told one of my colleagues that she knows I love her but she doesn’t want to love me back, and even if I propose in the future, she wouldn’t reciprocate.

What messes with my head is that she has shown mixed signals before, which gave me hope.

Another thing that’s bothering me: I don’t use Snapchat at all. I hate it because my last relationship (three years ago) ended partly because of issues around Snapchat. From my perspective, it’s mostly used for things I’m uncomfortable with. Recently I found out she has a Snapchat streak of around 275,000, and that really makes me uncomfortable.

So now I’m stuck.
Is it okay to feel this way?
Am I overthinking because of past relationship trauma?
Or should I accept that she’s not interested and move on, even though I can’t seem to get her out of my head?

t3_1ponev4,Conflict during dating [M27],"Hi everyone so me \\\[M27\\\] and she \\\[F26\\\] we both dated for 4 months and it all kinda got disrupted after an incident

So she was going with me to my house. I showed her my stuff and interests and she started to respond on my interests with some remarks but the thing that stuck the most was “Gamers can’t keep a girlfriend” and she said my friends also have no girlfriend and are gamers and I was like no I know why they don’t have one. And I said there are people who game and have a girlfriend or women gamers.

And eventually I said to her that if I come to someone their house I would respect their interests and she responded with that she didn’t respect my interrests ? And she took her stuff and wanted to leave and asked if she needed to leave.

But I was sitting on the bed being tired and stuff and annoyed and eventually I wanted to talk and explain and she interrupted me and usually I would take it but I said “let me talk” and she didn’t like that and eventually she looked at me and made a face and eventually I said Out and placed her outside my house.

After that moment it all went downhill mostly because of this. We did talk the next day but it was weird, all over the place and yeah. It kinda broke our time together and the connection and stuff we had.

So my question is, who was wrong and who was right in this. I feel like putting her out wasn’t the best idea but I did feel disrespected by her remarks like she didn’t care or kinda hurtful but she said she didn’t mean it like that and that I took it personally because she didn’t saw me aa someone who games even tho she was in a room full of it.

t3_1pk11dz,How to let someone down easy,"So for context, I have just gotten back into the dating scene. I got divorced 6 months ago, out of a 10 year long relationship. I finally feel as if I can maybe start getting my toes back into the water. I'm eager to see where things go, but I'm pretty much a newb at dating in general to be honest.

There is a woman who I met that I initially liked, and truly still do to a degree, but... to be perfect clear, she's just hard to communicate with. She is older than I am, has a few kids, and generally gives off the vibes of someone who really handles her own business well. It's impressive, truly. The problem is, everything is framed in a very pragmatic, practical way. She keeps things short, direct, and really isn't looking to waste time on frivolity. That's nice and I can admire it, but it really is killing our ability to communicate. I feel like I'm struggling to come up with things to keep conversations alive, and it looks like there really isn't a great fix for this and we have only gone on a few dates, so I think it's smarter just to cut it off, before I give her more feelings to deal with. 

That being said, I'm not really used to dating, and I'm a pretty empathetic person, and I dread hurting anyone's feelings. Logic tells me that since she handles life in such a direct way, that also being direct to her is the way to go, and I won't waste more of her time, but I do worry about her being ""blindsided"" by this.

t3_1piahue,Woman vanished and turned back up only to vanish again,"Long story short; I matched with a woman on a dating app in september. We went out within the first few messages and again that same week, although she was feeling under the weather she still wanted to go. We had a good time, kissed goodbye and there was a lot of physical contact on the date (no intimacy, to be clear). The third date failed to happen about 3-4 times now, with me mostly organizing but failing due to no response from her to confirm the date the day of/night of as i was picking her up (and shes in a gated complex so i cant just drive to her door). Anyway after 2  weeks of silence i thought she, like every other match this year, ghosted after 2 dates.

Fast forward to the mid november and she sends  me a message apologising for going MIA and that family matters had taken her focus (not going into details there. its not good) and asked if i wanted to resume where we were. I said yes and she was happy about that. I organized 2 seperate dates yet again and one fell through because her phone was damaged and the other she got stuck overnight at work and her replacement was sick so she couldnt leave. idk why she accepted a night shift the night before a date but maybe she needed the money. 

Anyways, i haven't heard from her since that day. Maybe she's busy, maybe she forgot, idk.

I'm posting this because im not sure whether to keep making the effort. I have tried and tried and tried to make this third date happen and she has agreed to each one but it just never happens for whatever reason.

That same night she had to go back to a different city for her university exams and won’t be back for about two weeks.

Our texting pattern is pretty consistent:
	•	I text her,
	•	She replies with long, detailed messages after ~30 minutes,
	•	She asks questions back,

Anyways I (mid-20s M) recently joined a new church congregation about 6 mo ago. Around the same time another girl joined, (early-20s) and at several of the first activities and services, I caught her looking at me. Usually once or twice per event. Didn't pay much attention, cause people make eye contact, yk? But at the same time, Ive heard many times that if someone keeps looking at you theyre interested in you. I just have never experienced that so up til this point I considered it folk psychology. 

Well then I subbed in for the organist one week, and she came up to me after the service to introduce herself and compliment my playing. She said she was a beginner at piano, so we talked Shop for few minutes. Then a few weeks later I permanently replaced our organist, and I have made a habit of practicing Sunday afternoons after our services and sunday school. She has come in several times in the past month and a half since I started doing this (more than half the time), and continually compliments my ability and we chat for a couple minutes. 
The convos are usually short lived and I can tell she's either A) nervous or B) distracted and its hard to tell which. 
But since becoming organist Ive also noticed that the frequency of making eye contact is increasing. Some of this is while I am sitting on the stand facing the congregation between hymns, so some eye contact should be expected, right? Its just that I dont really make consistent with anyone else in the congregation, and the room is well lit and we have a congregation of less than 100.

2) First time we had sex before we even started she had said if we don't end up figuring it out it will be over and the anxiety caused me not to be erect anymore
3) Second time we had sex we were both high and I was focused more on sensation and taking it slow than anything else, but I wasn't touching her or kissing her or anything else. Later she got really nervous and fucked up cus of the edible and I didn't call an ambulance immediately cus i was panicking and also fucked up, which also lead her to say what I'm about to say:

""We don't have chemistry in sex, and what happened with the ambulance also doesn't help in letting me see you sexually anymore""

Am I wrong or is chemistry something that needs to be built? You can't just have it from two times of having sex. She just wasn't willing to

Also before she dropped me off she made out with me on her own accord and said we could keep light contact and if I get more experience in sex we could try it again. What the fuck should I do? I think she's a walking red flag but idk

She's hard of hearing, but reads lips like a pro, i feel it would take multiple times meeting her before people picked up she's hard of hearing. We dated for 4 months before making it official, and its been two weeks since. 

2 months in, i started taking sign language classes and got this app that is essentially duolingo for sign.

She praises me a lot and tells me how much it means to her that im doing that (apparently her previous exs didnt). Like I do like her, but I dont think its a big deal. It doesnt compute to have a girlfriend in which the majority of her friends are deaf and for me not to learn sign. am I just going to ignore her friends or never do anything with them? Never go or particiate in any of their events? It seems like simple logic, if I want to have a real relationship with her, i need to learn sign.

Since none of her ex's have done that, I feel like she feels this is such a huge deal, like I must care about her an abnormal bit and more than anyone whose ever dated ber before. She mentions it semi-regularly. I appreciate that she's touched, but its not a big deal for me and ive even told her ""we couldnt really date if i cant speak the majority anyone in your world, I kind of have to learn sign, our relationship wouldnt work otherwise"" idk, perhaps its my fuckboyery, but it kind of scares me. I feel like I like her an appropriate amount for the time we've been dating but im not in love yet.

I could be overthinking this and I should just take it how it is and keep it moving, but part of me really wants to stress that for me, its basic bf stuff in this situation - but I feel that would come across as saying shes not important to me. I feel her logic works to a degree, like if I was just trying to hook up with her, i wouldnt learn sign language - at the same time the only weight me learning holds is that I like enough to date.

We hung out for a bit the other night and started talking. She kept pulling me in for hugs and held my hand. But also reiterated that I was just her friend.

So, my friends and I went on a weekend trip to a beach town pretty far away from where I live . I just got out of a 4 year relationship (it was amicable) and i honestly just needed this weekend. I was definitely struggling with the breakup and needed a reset. I wasnt expecting anything, just going with the flow, and this woman at the bar really was my interested in me. It wasnt just like attraction either, like we genuinely got along superwell. I thought she was attractive as well, so we spent the rest of the night together. My friends and I also loved her too. We went to a bunch of bars with her and her group, and overall it was just amazing

We ended up splitting off from the group and hooking up , and also spending alot of time talking about our lives and stuff and we were honestly in very similar situations (she was 1 year post breakup from a 4 year relationship). Everything just went so well and i wasnt trying to catch feelings but i think i did😭 she was just super into me and i hadnt felt that in a long time. It just felt so good since my recent partner kind of lost any feelings for me because of her own problems and maybe i just enjoyed being loved? Idk. 

The thing that sucks is that she lives near where our trip was, and im like 10 hours drive from there, not close at all. So What the hell do I do? Do i keep in contCt with her? Or do i just let it go? We followed eachother and I have her number, but its been 2 days since we met and we havent texted yet. I was gonna wait a week before sending anything, but i wasnt sure.

t3_1oy5lxo,Me 36M and fiancé 43f need opinions,"So me [36M] and my [43F] have been together for 1.5 years. When we met, we never really spent anytime apart. We were together every day and I basically lived with her and her 2 kids until I formally moved in with them in January.

Early on I had told her a story about an 18yo girl coming by my house and I lied about sleeping with her. She found about it later on but this was the first lie.

I had my old gf on my cell phone plan and she told me that it bothered her. My old gf wasn’t going to stop using the phone and send it back so I reported it lost through the phones insurance plan. At this point I thought the phone issue was done. 
In November my old gf texted me from that number (I didn’t immediately recognize it) and we exchanged a few texts back and forth. Some were flirty and my fiance says that I downplayed my relationship with her to my old gf by saying “I have to tell you, I probably shouldn’t be talking to you since I’m dating someone”. 
At this point I really do not know why I didn’t question “how is she using this number?” Since I had reported it lost a the SIM card and phone had been locked. I truthfully do not know why I didn’t immediately call my cell provider and ask how this line was being used.


I had also developed a bit of an online gambling issue and had borrowed money from her on numerous occasions. I always paid her back. She confronted me about it the first time and I lied telling her I wasn’t gambling. I didn’t borrow money from her anymore but I continued gambling throughout the next few months. She confronted me a second time and I lied initially before telling her I wasn’t gambling still gambling. 
The gambling basically stopped late last year.

Throughout our relationship I have added 5-10 women on Facebook that were in her words “attractive and single”. I was not messaging these women.

So a few months ago my fiance was contacted by the cell phone old gf
In January my fiance and I along with our 5 kids (not with each other) went down to Texas for Christmas (I’m from Texas and now live in another state). My fiance left with her 2 kids early and I stayed.
Once my fiance was gone, I messaged my old gf and arranged for her to come hang out at the air bnb that my fiance and I had. 
She showed up, I tried having sex with her but was too drunk.
My fiance confronted me about it and I lied about trying to have sex with her for 4 days.
3 or so weeks after this, my fiance at this point did not know what had happened in January and we decided to trade in my car for another, more expensive vehicle but it was financed in my finances name because my credit wasn’t good enough. There was a substantial amount of negative equity with my old car. 

In May of this year my 3 kids came up for the summer.
My fiance and I decided that keeping my kids here was what was best for them so they stayed.
My fiance did a lot work to get my kids enrolled in the schools that we wanted them in. 

My fiance tells me now that I didn’t help enough with the kids. She got them up for school everyday, cooked everyday and did all the things for the kids. 

My fiance has told me that she wants to break up, and she wants me and my kids to move out.
I’m fine with that and I have a place lined up to move into next week. 
We have been in limbo for 2 weeks now but we have been doing all of the things a couple would do like sleep in the same bed, kiss, hold hands, tell each other we love each other etc. 
I’m fine with moving out and I think it will help us be better parents too it kids because my fiance and I spend A LOT of time together. We are great friends and we generally communicate pretty well. We almost seem addicted to each other. 
So I will be moving out but I still want her and I to be together but she tells me that she doesn’t think we’ll ever be together again because she doesn’t trust me.
She didn’t trust me not to add or look at women on Facebook and she doesn’t trust me to be financially responsible.  
I feel as though she gave up on this relationship very easily. We have had our kids living together for 6 months now calling each other their siblings and living as one big happy family. 
We went to 2 couples therapy appointments before our therapist added her on Snapchat.

I know I wasn’t perfect by any stretch of the imagination and I have only put the bad stuff here but there is a lot of good stuff too. In my opinion more good than bad by far and to some extent she would agree. 
We were both great to each others kids in different ways. My kids got a mom and her kids got a dad. 
Her and I matched each others energies pretty close on most things. 
Sex was always great and plentiful. We were both satisfied a lot of the time.
We always enjoyed being with and around each other, didn’t argue much and enjoyed doing some of the same things. 

Her and I also drank a bit for the majority of our relationship which ultimately led to some incredibly poor decisions and laziness on my part due to being hungover a lot of times.
Her and I have quit drinking before and haven’t drank since we went into limbo 2 weeks ago.

I keep asking her how she gave up on everything we had built so easily.
Issues that she has brought up to me have either been rectified or there has been progress made. I am very aware that I have fucked up. There has been 2-3 women I’ve added since January of 25’ on Facebook.
I had still been paying for the old gf phone line until September (the phone had a payment plan and I didnt want to spend the $ to pay the phone off to cancel it.). 
I did start saving money and had been a lot smarter with my money but not as good as I could have been. 
We were also not financially dependent on each other. She had her money and I had mine until I created a joint account and had my check deposited into so she would know I wasn’t gambling. 

I feel like she looks down on me now and I hear her when she says it wont work ever again but I also hear her tell me she loves me and then kisses me.

How should we handle this? She doesn’t think I am seeing things from her perspective and I don’t think she is seeing them from mine.",Dependent_Victory855,Mixed signals,High
t3_1oxrwd0,Its been tearing me up inside. I dont know how it should feel.,"Hey everyone, I could really use some advice about my relationship.

I recently started seeing a new girlfriend. We went official about a month ago. We were both previously virgins, and this is both our first relationships. A few weeks before going official, she pulled me aside on our fourth date and said she had cold feet, the classic “it’s not you, it’s me.” I gave her space, and she eventually decided to continue seeing me.

Recently, I asked her about that cold feet moment because it had been hurting me too much to leave unspoken. That’s when she explained that her family had been leaning on her to get on a dating app. She hadn’t mentioned it before.

Even though she explained why she had cold feet, it still plays on my mind. I can’t help but wonder if, even for a second, she might have thought she didn’t want to be around me.

Since then, I’ve been feeling like I’m putting more into the relationship than she is. I feel like I have a spark for her, but I’m not sure she feels the same way. She hasn’t really complimented me, and sometimes it feels like she’s just comfortable being with me rather than genuinely excited about it.

I love being with her, but this situation has been tearing me up inside. I don’t want to overthink things, but I also don’t want to keep investing in a relationship where my feelings aren’t fully returned.

Is this something worth bringing up with my other half. If so how could I go about bringing it up and explaining how i feel?

For those who have been in similar situations, how can you tell the difference between someone who just expresses affection differently and someone who isn’t feeling the same way? How do you cope when you feel more invested than the other person without pushing them away?",HopelesslyaHoping,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1ox4fum,Cant move on from a Girl I lost years ago — Is this love or obsession? What should i do Seriously anyone there to help,"There’s a girl I liked — we had a cool bond, it could’ve been a really good friendship, maybe even a relationship 2–3 years back. But some things happened, and now we’re totally distant.

Still, there’s this regret — that the shortest span of time we shared was the best thing I ever experienced. Even now, years later, I’ve met new people, made new friends, been in temporary relationships… but everything feels so meaningless and temporary compared to that one connection.

Somewhere deep down, I keep feeling that if that thing would’ve actually happened, it could’ve been the purest and most perfect bond. And yes — it ended because of my mistake. I was very self-obsessed, a liar, money-minded, party-driven, toxic even. But now I’ve changed a lot — grown in my career, matured, and left all that behind.

Still, no matter what I achieve, those few moments with her haunt me. I can’t cling to anyone else, can’t even have a flirty conversation with someone new because in my mind, it’s still her. Maybe this is love. Maybe it’s obsession. I don’t know.

It’s been 3 years, and I still think about her every day. I keep wondering — does she even remember me? Is she still the same person? It’s crazy — even my mom once said we’d look really good together, and we don’t even have a photo!

I don’t know if this is madness, but my mind just won’t move on. Should I confess? Or should I let it go and just keep those small, pure memories forever, even if it stays one-sided?

Because the thought of her saying “no” feels shattering already. But what if I confess and things get worse — like we stop talking completely? Or what if it turns into something beautiful?

What do I do? Is it okay to just hold on to those old memories — the ones that feel so pure — and live with them? Because even though I have everything a 23-year-old guy could want — a stable career, money, no issues, a good life — it all feels empty without her.

This feeling wasn’t there in the last few years when I was distracted by parties, goals, temporary people… But now it’s like this emotion is unstoppable. Just one thought — say it and end it. But the end could destroy me… or maybe it could finally start something beautiful.

What should I do? From the past 4 years, I’ve been waiting down her building just to see one look, that one dead conversation to begin again. I always look at her on Instagram. She is the one for me. I’m tired now — tired of loitering around, tired of waiting — it’s fixed: she or no one.",[deleted],Mixed signals,High

We proceeded to kiss after she said that and the kiss was fire. the rest of the date went well and we are still talking but im wondering if men should just go for the kiss everytime and not ask for consent or keep asking just know some will be like “why you asking?”,Cashbackgiver,Repeated asking,High
t3_1ouwggg,Im lost,"So I’m kind of stuck right now. I’ve been in a relationship with this girl for about two months, and I really love her — she’s amazing and honestly everything I could want. Sure, there are a few small things that aren’t perfect, but the positives easily outweigh the negatives.
When we first started talking, I learned a bit about her family situation (it’s not the best). She has a mom and a half-brother, and I expected them to be protective — which they are, and I completely understand why. At first, things were really good. We could talk on the phone for hours and see each other after school almost every day. It felt natural and easy to be close to her.
But after about three weeks, her mom started restricting her more. She gave her a 6 PM curfew, which made things instantly harder. Whenever we would make plans, they would often fall through because of something on her end. Now, things have gotten even stricter: she can’t hang out at all, her phone use is cut off after 9 PM, and her mom checks it to make sure she’s not using it. On top of that, she’s being made to wake up earlier just to do her makeup.
I’ve talked to her about it, and she says she’ll try to make time for us, but I worry she’ll get in trouble with her mom. I hate the thought of getting involved in her family politics because they’re really messy. Personally, I’m a physically affectionate person — my love language is touch — so not being able to hug her or be close is really hard. In the two months we’ve been dating, we’ve only hung out twice and never gone on a proper date.
I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to force myself into her life, and it’s emotionally draining. Every time we talk, it feels real and addictive, but now even that connection is being limited by her mom. It hurts, and I feel lost. I don’t want to hurt her, but I’m not sure I can keep going under these circumstances.",Coxsosanis,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1oszcnn,"My dating advice - listen to your instincts. If something seems off, something is off.","A couple of weeks ago I posted the question linked below. The girl I was dating was still receiving snaps from her old fuck buddy and from a different guy that she used to date. I asked her to remove them bc it made me uncomfortable and there was no reason to keep them around. She assured me that she wasn’t opening them and that nothing was going on.

Well Friday she was over my house, and those unopened snap chats were now opened, one of them was a mirror dick pic, and she saved it in chat. I immediately broke up with her, we got in a huge fight about it, and all trust was evaporated instantly.

She begged me for another chance, begged me to “reset the relationship”, told me that she loved me for the first time ever.

But I have too much self respect to keep going after that. Learn from my mistakes. If something seems off, something is off. If something doesn’t seem right, you have to get all of the information.

This one sucks because I really did like her a lot as a person. I really wanted this one to be something.

t3_1oocb8o,I M 24 Am still sad about what my GF 22 said about liking someone else,"

Before I say the story, I do feel like I hold onto things longer than what’s needed and I get sad easier. Me M 24  and my gf F 22 just made it official recently . However, we have been exclusive for months. A month ago I would say,  I asked if she had any feelings for anyone else as like a joking kinda way thinking that it’ll be a clean/straight response. She laughed and said “obviously you” and then proceeded to say she likes someone at work. I told her right then and there I got sad by that because I only saw her and I still only see her. I don’t see anyone in that way since we’ve been talking . Once I brought this up, she then stated that it’s just background noise and that nothing will happen and there’s nothing between them. I was sad about this for awhile and I still am. Throughout this time, she changed her statement and said that she has lost feelings and she only felt that way beforehand. This is stuck in my head because originally that was not the answer and they are in the same friend group so they hangout. I have been there two times when they are hanging/talking and sadly,  I feel a certain way. I have seen her check this person  out when she’s dancing and it hurts that she does that. She told me she was just looking at the dress but idk. My eyes don’t look down like that . It hurts me seeing this person that my girl would or will do things with. The other person in this story is cool. I have no hate or any remorse towards this person but knowing what I know, it makes me sad a lot of the time and I have to hide it because I don’t want to show how I feel but at the same time I don’t want to hold this in. I know it’s not that deep but it is effecting me a good amount and I am not sure on how to go forward from this. I have brought it up multiple times to her but she tells me that there isn’t anything . How should I move forward. Should I keep bringing it up or just hold it in ?

t3_1oiz1d9,advice on living together,"I'm sorry if it's the wrong place, but I need some advice on how to do things right...

So, me, 40M, divorced, 2 kids. My girflriend 37F, also divorced with two kids. All of our kids are still pretty young (ranging 5 to 9 years old)

At this moment she owns a house and pays mortgage. I rent a house.

Her house is bigger, but not big enough to support 4 kids when in their teens. For now it would be ok.

  
We are thinking about living together and me moving in with her. And there are a few options, but we don't know what would be best...

a) I buy myself in into her mortgage. So I would give her half of what she already payed and I become 50% owner too. My savings go to zero, the remaining mortgage would be split, but when we sell the house, we get equal amount.

b) I just move in, pay a contribution (rent). I don't become owner. But it would only be for a few years, after which she would sell the house and we buy something new together. This way I keep my savings. And after the sale of the house, we both can contribute to buying something new. With this option, she is better off, while I still 'rent'... And like this, we would also avoid additional costs to change ownership, registration,...

  
Both options have their pro's and con's. I am a bit traumatized by my former marriage in which I was very much taken advantage of by my ex, so I I am a bit defensive. But I also don't want to impose on her belongings. Her house is her 'security deposit' for her kids too. I understand it too if she opposes to me buying into the house...

t3_1ojiv6j,Am I in the wrong for telling my friend I have sexual feelings for her?,"Hello everyone. I am seeking some advice / reassurance regarding quite a complex situation I was involved in last year. I have previously posted this several months ago, but deleted it out of fear that the other person (who is involved) will see it. So, I apologise if you are seeing it a second time.



I am a 21 year old woman who identifies as a lesbian. The other person who I will be referring to throughout this post is a 20 year old woman who I will call ‘Ella’ (I am unsure of how she defines her sexuality at the moment). The situation that led to the end of our friendship is complex and long, but I will try to keep this post short without neglecting relevant points on both sides. Firstly, there is some important background information necessary for everything to make sense:



* ‘Ella’ and I have been close friends throughout secondary school and afterwards (from about age 13 - 20)
* There have been issues within our friendship before the fallout i.e. I felt underappreciated as I would spend a lot of my time listening to her problems, but she would make very little time to listen to anything personal I wanted to share
* I would consider Ella as my first real crush. I had very strong romantic feelings for her when we were around 14 up until 17 (there was no indication that she reciprocated).
* I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) when I was around 15, and Ella was one of the first people I told (this will be important later)
* I have been feeling extremely upset, guilty and distraught about what went down for months and can’t seem to move forwards

In Summer 2024, when we were 19, Ella came out to me as bisexual, which was an emotional moment for her. I appreciated her trust and wanted to support her, though she seemed uncertain about her identity, experimenting with labels like lesbian, bisexual, and straight, which was confusing for both of us.

Over time, our friendship became more intimate. We started discussing sexual topics and occasionally flirted. For example, during a picnic, she once said, “I don’t think I could go through life without having a woman sit on my face,” then smirked at me. She would not tell me who she was thinking about. I took this as a sign of mutual attraction and a hint that she may want to be intimate with me. I felt happy because although I no longer had romantic feelings for her, I was still physically attracted to her.

She started university in October and met a guy she seemed to be interested in. She kept me updated with their relationship e.g. first kiss, dates, etc. which did make me feel jealous and uncomfortable. This led to us talking about her sex life with her boyfriend, which definitely crossed boundaries looking back. I playfully encouraged her to 'spill the tea' as I wanted to make sure she was ok / had someone to rely on, but I did get excited hearing about her in a sexual way, which made me feel really guilty. Is that weird?

  
Our conversations became increasingly more sexual and personal, often crossing boundaries. She once messaged me in French saying that she was said that she couldn't 'help me' in a sexual way because she loved her boyfriend too much. I responded that she would be missing out on a good time (cringey I know). The confusing thing is, we weren't even talking about sex explicitly here. I was pleading for her to help me talk to another girl who is also a lesbian, but it somehow was interpreted as me asking for sexual favours from Ella? She then said that she 'has to be speak in French to put off horny lesbians like me' which I did find a little bit offensive and confusing because I was not even asking her for favours, despite the playful nature of the conversation. I think it is clear that we both enjoyed the excitement of talking about things that are 'taboo' or 'naughty' and had gotten carried away. I did share with her that I felt a flirty vibe between us, which she denied saying we were just friends, which I found contradictory.

  
Over Christmas, we planned to meet up in person to make pizza and hang out at her house. However, the day before, she sent me a screenshot in the morning of her ovulation tracker. She told me that she was ovulating the day of our meeting (or around that time) and was wondering how to control her 'feralness' whilst being apart from her boyfriend. I found this oddly intimate and the timing was kind of strange. It felt like a hint that her and I should be intimate the next day. I shared that I was ovulating (which was true) as I didn't know how else to respond / was hopeful she may want to do something about it and break up with her boyfriend. 

  
We met the next day. Immediately, I felt sexual chemistry / tension between us. There were lots of stolen glances, smirks, awkward silences, etc. alongside weirdly intimate / flirty conversations. For example, she messaged me whilst her sister was in the room with us (even though we were sat together on the sofa) telling me that she wanted to 'frame her boyfriend's face with her thighs' and that she was feeling horny. Again, I don't know if it is wrong of me to feel like that is her flirting with me, even though she mentions her boyfriend? It just feels very intimate to share with a friend and it was accompanied by smirking and giggling. Her sister even asked us what was going on. I genuinely felt that something physical was going to happen between us that day (nothing did happen).

  
The next day, I was feeling confused and honestly very impulsive. I messaged her about my sexual feelings as I could not cope with feeling so confused anymore. Here is a very similar version of the message I sent: 

‘I would like to share something with you. I really do not want to make you feel uncomfortable, but I feel that I need to communicate this with you for the sake / health of our friendship. I am unsure of how to say this politely, so I will just go for it. I can’t stop feeling horny around you and I keep on thinking about going down on you. The flirty conversations that we have intensify my horniness even more. I know you will deny this but I do feel that there are clear flirty comments that have been made and I was wondering if you could be honest with me like I have been with you. Do you have sexual feelings for me?'

  
I found this really difficult to type as it is cringey to me now (which is a sign of growth, right?) However, this did not go down well, at all. After one week of no contact, she shared with me that she felt that I had sexualised her / disrespected her sexuality (she was identifying as straight again) and relationship. The use of the word 'sexualised' deeply upset me and I felt an intense rush of shame, as I do not objectify women. In fact, I despise people that objectify women in a sexual way and do not want to be associated with that at all. At the time, I did vehemently disagreed, trying to prove myself as someone who treats women with respect. I also felt that there was a slight double standard there as she would talk about her sexual feelings towards her boyfriend / make sexual comments towards me and my sexuality (such as I am a 'horny lesbian' or telling me she is ovulating). I made an effort to reassure her that whilst yes, I am attarcted to her, I DO NOT see her as an object. I deeply care for her and admire so many of her personality traits. I value our friendship dearly. 



Furthermore, I feel it is important to mention that I find her style of communication pretty difficult to work with. As I have autism, I do have a tendency to take things literally, so when she sends flirty messaged, I take them at face value. However, she told me that all of the flirty comments she made were all just a joke. This made me feel crazy and question everything I remember. She asked me why I can 'flirt' with my other friends and not think they like me, but with her I take it seriously. Whilst, yes, my other friends make flirty comments, the words and tone of them are completely different. They say things like 'omg let's put our Minecraft beds together, that would be so cute!' which is clearly lighthearted and they laugh whilst saying it. Ella, on the other hand, messages me very sexual things without any emojis or other indicators that she is joking. I feel that she should of considered my autism and cut me a bit of slack there as she knows how I struggle with social cues some times. She also uses very over the top language, or as I like to call it, 'Shakespearean talk.' She uses big words (which I have to google the definition of) rather than using plain English. I believe she does this to appear more emotionally intelligent / aware than she really is because when I translate the words, she is basically just saying a whole load of nothing. She also likes to take ages to reply (1 week plus) or just straight up ignore messages. I understand her needing space, but it feels like avoidance and I have communicated how anxious it makes me feel when she leaves me hanging for so long.



I think the reason why this hurt me so deeply is because I still have residual shame around my sexual feelings towards women. As a teenager, I genuinely felt that I was a perverted sexual predator for having sexual feelings for women, and that all the people I love will hate me / think I am strange. I also am struggling with intense guilt around the idea that I have made someone feel uncomfortable. This may sound dramatic, but it really feels like the ground has crumbled beneath my feet when I feel that I have hurt someone. I know that it is impossible to go through life without upsetting people at time (unintentionally, of course) but I just cannot cope with my feelings surrounding this. I am genuinely worried that I am a pervert that needs serious help. I feel that I am a really terrible person for what I said and how I handled my emotions afterwards. I have very little to no experience with relationships so I honestly am not sure if I am capable of having healthy relationships.



After many months have passed, I have come to realise that whilst my intentions were never to hurt her, but rather for clarity and continuation of our friendship, my words still had a negative impact. I think my choice of words were too explicit and put her under the spotlight too much. I appreciate how this was made especially tricky as she is in a relationship. I am genuinely sorry for my poor choice of words and also both mine and Ella's behaviour was not fair towards her boyfriend. We crossed boundaries that should have never been crossed, and I do feel that my behaviour has gone against my own moral values as I consider myself to be a very loyal person.

t3_1oenvfa,Need advice on girl I’ve been seeing and her ghosting I’m 20 and she’s 20 too,"Hey all, I would like to get advice on this subject matter. I've been seeing this girl for the better part of 2 or so months now (though it feels way longer) we flirt and we even went on a first date not too long ago, but there is a problem with her ghosting and message replies, here is some background

1.	⁠We met at driving class and instantly hit it off, we flirted and always made sure to be each others practice buddy. She only mentioned one time she had a bf, which never stopped us from flirting with of course some boundaries on her part. However I noticed that she has a habit of not replying to messages so texting with her feels very difficult. She will text back around 7 to 8 hours sometimes even days after, but when she does it’s all warm and nice.
2.	⁠After driving class ended and about a month ago she texted me outta no where to “just talk” and she ended up telling me about how she broke up with her bf and was feeling sad, I did not want to be the rebound so I did not push for a date or meetup. About a couple weeks after, she sends me a voice note singing me happy birthday and that’s when I proposed a meetup with her. Since she will be doing an exchange year in France soon. What follows is her telling me she wants to see me very bad and that she had a dream about me, she gave me her whole schedule and told me to pick the days where she was free.
3.	⁠We picked the day and of course leading up to it we still flirted and what not, I drove to her uni and picked her up, gave her flowers (to which she exclaimed was the first time she has received roses in her life) and the date went on as expected very smooth and very fun, she did mention she had a cold so I did not push for any physical contact and nothing of the sort happened. And she did give me a gift with a note she wrote that was signed “cutie (insert her name) ;)”
4.	⁠After the date she consistently made sure I was home safe (It’s a 30min drive) and when I did get home everything else was great the after texts were great we talked a lot and flirted more. Now on paper this seems great but I just don’t know why she keeps on being hot and cold. One moment it’s great and we’re having a great convo and the next I’m sitting on my last sent messages 2 days ago.
5.	⁠There is a inherent problem with logistics that I must mention, we are very far apart and we go to different schools, plus my schedule is jam packed as I have school in the morning and I’m juggling my full time and part time jobs as well as managing my own organization. Sometimes it feels like jobs and working is so much easier to understand than dating haha.

She’s cute and she’s got a personality that makes me open up and for some reason we can talk about any topic for hours on end, and we both met each other at a time where we just got out of a relationship. (I broke up with my ex 3 months ago and she broke up with her ex 1 month or so ago) She has pushed for a second date telling me she’s “always free for me” but I don’t know how to feel if every-time I text her it’s like rolling a dice to see if I’ll get a reply or not.

I’m currently waiting on a reply to a text I sent around 2 days ago. Since then I know she is using her phone since she still posts stories and watches and likes my stories lol. This whole thing feels very weird and I wonder if this is just how she is or if she is being hot and cold because her breakup is still fresh and she’s not over her ex. Granted I know some of you guys might feel like I am also moving too fast after leaving a 3 year relationship only mere 3 months ago.

Thanks again guys I really appreciate all the insight I can get so I can make a more informed decision on whether or not I’m just beating a dead horse.",Spiritual_Freedom_72,Mixed signals,High
t3_1ogdikr,Life-changing decision,"I’m a musician who took a cruise ship contract a few months ago. Prior to taking this I was in a very loving relationship. We both decided to break up because neither of us wanted to do long distance. However, while on the ship, nothing changed. We still remained very close. That left me with a decision. Remain doing cruise work and break up for good. Or come back to make it work with her. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. The contract is coming to an end and I can’t make a decision. My mental health is in the drain. Our relationship is strained because I can’t make up my mind and keep going back and fourth.

I decided to take the contract. However, when I got home in between the contracts, I met up with her. She stayed the night and this resulted in me not showing up to the first day of rehearsal, going MIA, and dropping out of the contract. My bridge has been burned with this company. 

Fast forward to now. I’m deciding to follow my dream of being a cruise ship musician by applying to a different company. She is distancing her self from me because of this. But I am instantly have regrets. If I don’t make the auction, I have lost both her and my dream job. Should I turn back now to be with her? What is wrong with me.

t3_1ohv8i9,i need some advice on this girl that I met.,"Ok, I was living in a state for about a year and I got a job and I met a girl there. We had a lot in common (same hobbies, going to school for the same niche degree, etc) I was only at this job for about 3 months before I moved again. I really liked this girl and I would have probably asked her out if I wasn’t there for such a short amount of time. (We barely had shifts together, she could only work mornings and I could only work nights, so we didn’t even get to talk that much) whenever we were working together we would talk throughout the entire shift and had really good chemistry, at least it seemed that way to me. Now to present day. I have thought about this girl at least once a week since I moved away back in march of this year. I attempted to text her on Instagram and at first we were keeping contact but sometimes she would just leave me on seen for like 2 weeks and then reply out of no where until the last time she did it and she hasn’t replied since just left it on seen and that was in April. I can’t help but think I missed my shot and there’s no going back but I literally can’t stop thinking about her. I also have had dreams with her in them (nothing weird just like we were working a shift together). So, do I tell her? Do I let it go? Am I weird for always thinking about her? I really don’t know.",Perfect-Chipmunk9063,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1odvznz,Need to decide if i reach back out to this girl,"For context, this wasn't a long term relationship, but I need some advice. I was seeing this Russian woman (I'm American), for a little bit less than a month. We were seeing each other twice a week. She talked about wanting to pursue a long term relationship and said how she was picturing a relationship between us. Things went well and were properly progressing, but there was a clear decline after the second to last time I saw her. By the last time, I knew something was off. But, we continued to text and she still wanted to tell me random things about her or what she was doing. Until, I asked her to hangout. She responded and basically said she feels awkward between us and the feeling wasn't going away. I ended up telling her how I just felt nervous to mess up in front of her. I was focused on being masculine, calm, and grounded. An aspect that I lacked in my past long term relationship, so i filtered myself a lot more and became boring. I added that I didn't really think she would be interested in hearing me ramble or really open up. She said thats the type of thing she wanted. And I could tell I had hurt her feelings, by inadvertently saying ""I didn't think you cared about me enough to want to hear"". Looking back I realized how big of a fuck up that was on my part. Especially since she was quite open with me. She seemed like she needed vulnerability to build trust, while Im the opposite, I need trust to be vulnerable. And, just to set it straight, nothing I ever told this girl was a lie about who I am or how I felt about her. I was just quieter and not as willing to share as she was. She ended it by saying she felt pretty unmotivated and didn't see how things would work now because she was drained. But sadly, hearing her say she was actually interested to hear that type of stuff was the green light I needed to open up. I feel that most women don't like emotions, and I just never properly communicated with this woman to get that answer. She is great and I realized how badly I fumbled by trying to overcorrect my past issues.

Its been a week now since we have talked and a part of me really wants to reach out and just get the opportunity to show her who I am. But, the other part feels like I shouldn't and should just keep on moving forward. Let me know what y'all think.",EnvironmentalAir2625,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1ocp4ua,"Women I date want to keep me as a friend, but not a romantic partner. Am I wrong for turning them down at this point?","Right now, I'm (32/M) reaching wit's end about a problem but I feel like I may be wrong about it. I am told I have great conversation, am respectful, and have other great qualities, but women want me in their life as just their friend and nothing else. Most recently, I had cut someone off who suggested this after 3 dates. We held hands, kissed, and had plenty of banter, but she said she just didn't feel the romantic spark she wanted. However, she still said that I'm a great guy and she wanted to still remain friends, and I just said I can't after what felt like something more than a friendship. 

Let me say right now, I ***love*** having female friends; the majority of my closest friends are women, and I've become friends with many people I've dated over the years. Anyone telling you that the opposite sex can't be friends or that women should only be seen romantically/sexually is a misogynistic loser or painfully weird. But I feel like it's not wrong to want more at this point.

I can concede that maybe it's my vibe and how I approach dating. I guess I focus on being too respectful to the point where I may not dive into topics that open up romantic interest and that may give women the impression I'm boring. Or maybe I just have bad luck with it entirely. But even when I try to give flirty looks, compliments on their appearance and try to be obvious in showing romantic interest, it gets me nowhere. I don't want to keep hearing that I'm this total catch and get nowhere.

But at this point, I feel like don't want to be friends with someone who clearly liked me enough to be physically intimate at a certain point. I'd rather not be a hanger on or provide free emotional labor or someone who won't reciprocate it. Am I wrong or should I change how I approach this? ",CaptPierce93,Mixed signals,High
t3_1obp87q,Letter to the bros (and ladies if you feel this applies),"To preface, I've been reading through a lot of post's on this sub and discussing dating issues and there seemingly profound impact when they take effect. To generalize, I often see stories of people discussing first date fails, ghostings, fallouts, etc in a way that seems to impact them a lot. So much so that they describe their experiences as if they're love life is destroyed.

My goal with this post is not to invalidate anyone's feelings. Rather, I hope to expose my line of thinking in a way that helps people to realize they're much stronger than they seem to think they are. Specifically, I'm writing this as a letter to the bros. If you can't tell, I was born a dude, and I am writing this post from my perspective as an average dude in his 20's to make his way to finding the right woman (note: this is not an attack against my homosexual bros, if you feel this advice applies to you, that's awesome). If anyone of any gender or sexual identity does feel that what I'm saying applies to them also, that's cool. Again, Im prefacing this by saying this is what I feel from my experience. I am not a therapist or doctor, just a guy finding his way.

With that, I want to start by saying this. You will be ok. You may feel hurt or sad, but you will be ok. Your emotions are real, but you need to realize you are much stronger than you think. Culturally, we are in a relatively unique era. For most of human history, the way men went about getting ladies was much more antiquated and inappropriate compared to what we understand now. In today's era, we are much more aware of the wants and needs of women, but there is a great deal of fear surrounding getting a girlfriend due to the potential social blowback. Being deemed ""creepy"" or ""weird"" can be a total confidence killer when you're not trying to be either of those things (note: this is not meant to invalidate women who are hit on by weirdos, just acknowledging the perspective for a lot of guys). It also doesn't help that much of the initial exposure for my generation to getting girls was through movies and tv shows, who often ""romanticize"" romance into being a more narrow and simple road than it actually is. You grow up seeing your favorite TV show or movie character fall in love with the same girl, have all these experiences, then they live happily ever after. As a result, a lot of us internalized those viewings as being indicative of what love actually is. Unfortunately, these factors have lead to us missing what finding a partner and the experiences it takes are actually made of.

First and foremost, understand that the next girl you fall for will likely not be the last. Human's and their feelings are complex, and that's just as true for ladies as it is for the men. As a result, when you go on a date, what you experience could be completely different from what she feels. The rose tinted glasses you had may not have been warn by her. Even if you both had a great date, feelings can change. Just like how your feelings can change towards someone after an initial date or interaction, women can feel the exact same way. You have to learn to accept this. People in general (not just women) will almost always to default to small lies on initial dates rather than big truths so as to not hurt another person's feelings. When I think of the times I've had good dates than a girl text's me and says she isn't interest anymore, I've realized that they likely didn't want to hurt my feelings in the moment by saying ""I don't like you"" or ""I don't want to see you again"". Yeah it sucks that people do this, but truthfully, most of us are gonna do better with a small lie than a big truth when it comes to ending something. At the core of this point, I want you to realize that the best thing you can do is go out as frequently as you can. Gain experience with different girls, and understand that a lot of them will only be first dates. There is nothing wrong with that. But, the only way you can find that ""one"" that you make it to the next date with, is to meet as many people as you can. Think of it like networking, where the path to your next job is meeting the next person.

Secondly (and time for some tough love), you're feelings are true, but you have to control them. Yeah, it sucks getting ghosted or dumped. It blows when you go out on a date and either make a mistake that F\*\*k's up the whole thing, or leave it thinking it went well only to never get a text back. You have every right to feel sad or emotional in someway about it. However, you also have just as much of a responsibly to yourself to recover. As stated previously, in a healthy life, you are likely gonna be going on dates with a ton of different people. If you hold onto this attitude that you have been wronged and refuse to open up again, then nothing changes. You will not grow. The vast majority of people that you see go out and develop long term relationships have taken the same steps as you, they just chose not to give up. I understand I'm saying this in a pretty cold manner, but compassion can only go so far. At the end of the day, we all choose to make the decision to go out and meet people. We also have the same capacity to wallow in our pain and do nothing. If you want to wallow then go ahead, but understand, nothing will change. If you need to mourn what you thought was special, go ahead. But if you deliberately choose to be a victim to your emotions, you'll continue to be miserable and judgmental of the same people who chose to keep going when you quit. In short, get over it.

Finally, I want to leave with a brief summary of my dating life. I grew up extremely awkward. I was diagnosed with learning disabilities at an early age, which destroyed my confidence. I also enjoyed sports, but I was a late bloomer and picked on a lot as a result. The combining social isolation, school struggles, and sports struggles made me fearful of pursuing girls. I really learned to develop a dating life in my early 20's, at which point I had physically developed and started exercising regularly. Still, for what I made up for physically, I still was very naive and immature due to my lack of dating experience growing up. As a result, my first stints into dating were tough. I remember I had spent a month hanging out with this one girl, and asked her very early on to be my girlfriend. While she had said yes at the time, after a week, she texted me and said that she said yes because she didn't want to hurt my feelings, and felt we had rushed into this. I was broken up about that for almost a year. Prior to that, I had realized I had feelings for a high school classmate that I never told how I felt, even after finding out she liked me. When I tried to reach back out to her, she wasn't interested. These experiences, combined with other dating failures that followed made me miserable. However, after some time to myself and getting a volunteer role coaching lacrosse (my favorite sport as a kid), I developed new found sense of purpose and reflection on my life. I ended up looking at these experiences and realizing they were not mistakes. They were in fact necessary to my growth. Yeah it sucks that none of those first dates or months together worked out, but I've grown wiser and more mature as a result. Now, I have found much more success with women, not because I suddenly am getting more second or third dates, but because I'm not held down by the past and am willing to go on many dates with numerous women. And still, there will be times where a girl I like is gonna leave that first date with the ick. That sucks, and I likely will have to reevaluate in someway, but sometimes you just aren't right for one another. So if you leave a date knowing you didn't do anything ""creepy"", than accept the outcome and move on (unless you did do something weird, in which case, don't do it again).

What I am trying to say is that you are the culmination of your experiences, and your interpretation of them can make or break your dating life. If you choose to be held up on dogma surrounding what could've been, or wallow in your emotions because you chose not to move on, you will forever be miserable. However, if you can accept that the trials and errors of your dating life are a necessary step to finding that special person, then I promise you, it will all work out in the end.

t3_1ob9z3a,Interested in someone’s friend,"Hi Everyone!

Going into my 3rd year of college I began talking to a girl. Our talking stage only lasted a month and only when on two dates, both being very lowkey (just got food and walked/talked the whole time). I decided to cut things off with her because I felt like we weren’t very compatible. I was very expressive, talkative, goofy, and overall extroverted. She was shy, whimsy and soft spoken, while I didn’t mind those traits it felt like I was putting a lot of effort to keep things engaging and fun for both of us. So after our second date I let her down easy and told her exactly what I explained above. Surprisingly, she was attached to me more than I thought, but ultimately respected my decision.
Fast forward to two months after we stopped talking, we both see each other often as we’re in the same club. We talk sparingly but it’s often me that initiates the convos but they aren’t awkward or strained.
However, this girl I’ve stopped talking to has a friend (it’s actually her cousin) that’s more bubbly, expressive, and funny. I’ve taken an interest and honestly have a crush on her. We’ve talked multiple times, and have really engaging conversations but also have a blast when goofing around. She also happens to be bi which I didn’t know at first but don’t mind. We only talk in person but neither of us have initiated texting over phone, however have noticed her interacting with my social media profiles more. (Liking my notes, story, and reposts)
I just wanted to know if there’s a timeline I should follow before acting on these feelings a little more seriously, especially considering I was talking to her friend before her. Thank you!",Weird_Bodybuilder857,General dating / relationship,Low

t3_1oadnuo,Is this the right decision?,"
I 17M have been dating my girlfriend 16F for a year and 3 months. Early in the relationship when it was first progressing I expressed to my girlfriend that it makes me unhappy when she posts herself on social media. The things she posts aren’t provocative or revealing or anything like that but it still makes me unhappy that’s just how I am. When I told her this she stopped posting herself which I was very appreciative of. Fast forward she begins posting herself again. After this I noticed I sort of naturally pulled back in terms of being affectionate and my overall energy in the relationship. She notices this and tells me that I shouldn’t care whether or not she posts and that that’s how she expresses herself and she doesn’t do it for attention or anything like that. Part of me thinks she’s in the wrong because she continues to doing something that she knows makes me unhappy but another part of me thinks neither  of us are in the wrong, she wants to do what she enjoys doing but I also don’t want to ignore my own feelings and keep being unhappy. My conclusion is that we’re simply not compatible and I’m considering breaking up but I need opinions from others on this.

t3_1o4j5hw,Been thinking about this girl for over a year now and we were never together,"My senior year I started talking to this girl and she was a junior. I thought it was going well. We hung out about 3 times outside of school. Also consistent ft’s and texting everyday talking about random stuff. Everything went well and slowly I was building more courage to ask her to be my gf. This was about two months talking now. All of a sudden one day she had cold feet and said we should stop talking because I was going to college soon and she had some program in the summer so we would barely see each other. At first I thought this was bs and that there were other reasons because I had gotten accepted to my college by December and it was early feb at this point. Anyways time passes and she was on my mind from time to time. A month passes by and she hits me up again asking a stupid question. I guess it was her way to try to pry herself back into my life. I didn’t entertain it much, which was weird because I still had feelings for her. I start picking up on some signs on her insta for example she used the same sound on one of my posts for hers. Thought it was strange because we had different taste in music. Eventually we hit the last day of school and I was feeling good so that day I decided I was going to ask her to sign my yearbook. I guess I wanted to see how she was doing. Last period and for context I knew which direction she would be coming from. I catch a glimpse of her turning into our stairwell to exit the school. I’m ngl I started walking faster to catch her before she left. Then my friend stops me in the middle of the hall to ask to sign my yearbook. Ofc I accept, but I’m frantically panicking to make sure I get her. Just as she is in the lobby just a step from the door I manage to catch up to her and she signs my yearbook. Later that day she hits me up again and  we catch up and we both admit we both miss talking. We agreed to see each other at least once before she had her program where she was basically gone for the entire summer. The hangout was almost perfect it was sunny we went just walking around got some desert. After that day we were texting each other from time to time just talking about our days. Eventually we stopped I guess we just got busy. I had a job and she was at her program. The timing was just never right. I’m a month into college now and it’s crazy to think that I still think about her. I would be lying if i said it wasn’t daily. So what do you guys think? Do I give it up? Do I keep pursing her?

t3_1o0ged6,Falling in love + Backpacking + anxiety &amp; stress. How do I keep the spark alive and not lose her?,"I’ll keep this as short as I can. Please help me out — I’m feeling lost.

I’m in my mid '25M' and so is she '25F' . We met about 4 weeks before I left for South America. We’d known each other distantly, went on a few dates, and really clicked. Even though I was going away, we agreed to stay in touch — and we texted the entire 3 months I was gone.

Our travel plans ended up overlapping, and we spent two amazing months together — literally every day. It felt right. She’s the love of my life. When it was time to part ways again, we agreed to be exclusive while she continues her trip (she’s back in 3 months). We both said “I love you,” but she wants to wait to define things officially until we’re both home and can see what real life together looks like.

Here’s the problem: I’m home now, and the distance is really getting to me. I trust her, but the anxiety and overthinking hit hard — especially when communication dips (travel days, partying, time zones). She’s social, I’m social… but it’s tough not to spiral and assume she’s drifting away.

We can’t plan our reunion yet because her dates aren’t confirmed, and I’m scared of investing more feelings just to get hurt. I know she’s not a player and has a solid relationship history — she just wants to be sure things are right once she’s home. Still, I’m terrified that she’ll decide she wants a “single break” or that the spark will fade.
I love her deeply, but not being part of her daily life right now is painful. The uncertainty eats at me.

How do I:
- Keep the spark alive while we’re apart?
- Manage the anxiety and fear of losing her?
- Stop overthinking when communication slows down?
- stop feeling sad and hurting 
- without too much pressure as time and also her busy schedule

t3_1nz2fvs,my girlfriend (18f) wants me (18m) to leave university because she changed her mind,"so basically me and my gf have been dating for almost 3 years and because of strict parents we have had to hide a lot and have been caught multiple times so while she planned the universities i followed her. we planned that when we go to uni well get married and be together without having to worry about them and be able to spend time together more freely. before confirming universities she told me to look for other universities closeby or good because she thought it might be too risky but i kept saying no because i wanted to be with her and assured her it wasnt risky.

it has been 1 week of university and my girlfriend is saying that i should leave because she feels guilt because shes hiding it from her family and she saying i should leave because she researched the uni, loved it and i followed her here but they had my course and i rlly liked the university too before i knew she wanted to come here im settled into the uni and im enjoying my course if i leave i wont be able to go to university this year and will have to go to different one next year but if she leaves she wont have a chance at any good uni. she had chose this university for herself before planning about us because she really liked everything about it and they had my exact course and the university labs sounded cool as well so i followed, further notice she looked into research for me and found more top universities with my course which i could go next year.

i wouldve gone to any uni she went but this had my course and the facilities so it made sense we come here together and i want to stay at this university also we are muslim which adds to her guilt. she wants me to leave because she feels guilt and im saying to her that if she wants to be separate she can leave the uni if she wants or we can stay at the uni but not contact each other she thinks we wont keep that and will end uo talking/meeting as we havent been able to do breaks before what should we do shes not sticking to the plan and wants me to give up the university because shes changed her mind but if she leaves shell give up her uni and her course and will have to go elsewhere or we can both stay but she doesn’t want that",[deleted],Emotional pressure,High

l also get jealous about small things, not openly but in my head. A joke about being with someone else makes me a lot more uncomfortable than it should.

If I feel like her messages are just a bit dry or if I'm left on delivered for too long I also get really upset, I start to assume that l've done something wrong or that she's upset with me.

I know l've got some issues I need to sort out here. In my day to day life I'm really not an insecure person, l've got a good self esteem and I'm generally really happy. There's just something about relationships that make me into an anxious and insecure person.

What l'm really looking for is a word to describe this so I know howl can improve it. Because I can see this ruining relationships in the future. I don't want to be constantly stressed and I don't want this relationship to end just because I'm seeking attention.

This is really a personal topic for me, I know I might sound like a loser here but I'm just trying to be as honest as possible with myself and you. If you've got negative comments please just keep in mind I'm still young and figuring life out. Any advice would be appreciated. ❤️ Sometimes when I feel overwhelmed it helps to talk on forums like this.

TL;DR:
I’m an 18M who gets really anxious and needy in relationships even though I’m confident in every other part of my life. I constantly want my girlfriend’s attention, get jealous over small things, and overthink when her replies are short or delayed. I know it’s unhealthy and don’t want it to ruin things, but I’m not sure why I’m like this or how to fix it. Just looking for a word to describe it and some advice on how to get better.",Signals777,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1ntplh3,Please help me guys (I'm confused af),"# Confessed feelings to a girl after her breakup, need advice on what to do next

**Background:**
I (M) have been talking to this girl for a while. We're long distance. We've had some deep conversations about love, relationships, parenting, psychology - topics we're both interested in. However, we didn't know each other well on a personal level and our conversations weren't very consistent. We only had our first video call 2 days before I confessed.

**The situation:**
She recently went through a breakup and I decided to tell her my feelings. She didn't say no directly, but said she would let me know if something could happen in the future.

When I confessed, she asked me several questions:
- What kind of relationship do you actually want?
- Do you know my needs and what I look for in a partner? Like she is intensive in love she told me.
- Also, she told me that I don't know you on a personal level yet
- Other similar compatibility questions

**Recent developments:**
After this conversation, I told her I wanted some distance for a while to clear my head. I mentioned that I'd miss our conversations.

Her responses:
- She asked me exactly when I would come back - like she wanted a specific timeline
- She said she would miss our conversations too when I said that first
- She seemed genuinely concerned about when I'd return

**Additional context:**
- Before I confessed, she had come to me with personal problems (mental health, physical health, career issues) and I helped her with problem-solving
- She's moving to an another place for work in 5-6 days
- Before I confessed, when I mentioned I might visit Delhi, she said ""if you can come, definitely come""
- We both have interests in psychology and similar intellectual topics

**My current dilemma:**
1. I'm getting mixed signals - her questions, asking when I'll return, saying she'll miss talking to me
2. I'm anxious about the distance I asked for, worried nothing will happen
3. I was planning to visit her anyway, but now wondering if I should still go
4. I don't know if I can handle just being friends with her
5. I'm torn between having hope and protecting myself emotionally

**Questions:**
- What do her questions and responses actually mean?
- Should I stick to the distance I asked for?
- Should I still visit her when she moves there?
- Am I reading too much into her asking when I'll return?
- How do I approach conversations when I do come back without being her emotional support person?
- Should I keep any expectations or just prepare for friendship?

Any advice would be appreciated. I'm really confused about the whole situation and don't want to mess things up further.

**TL;DR:** Confessed to a girl after her breakup, she didn't say no but asked compatibility questions and wants time. She asked exactly when I'd return from the distance I requested and said she'd miss our talks. Going crazy trying to figure out what this means and what I should do next.",Fancy_Back_180,Mixed signals,High
t3_1ntdjdj,is the age gap weird?,"I've been close friends with this girl for a few years now and recently I have developed feelings for her the only possible issue is that she is 16 turning 17 in a few months and I'm 18 turning 19 a few months after she turns 17, I plan on telling her that I like her but I'm afraid that she will think its weird and say no and possibly ruin our long friendship that we've had.

I can easily wait until after she turns 17 to tell her if that's the best idea.

I really want things to go well between me and her even if it means not telling her that I like her at all

t3_1nv4rbg,Online dating question...?,"Been talking to an Asian girl online for just 2 months and we both like each other. She lives about 400 miles away which is a pretty big thing but she says she came from an Asian country. I'm into Asians. Weee. I know there are a lot of fake Asian profiles on Facebook dating but they usually try to make you go to Whatsapp immediately. She hasn't tried to do that. I'm not exactly sure what she wants. She seems a little hesitant to form a relationship and wants to take things slow. She says I am the only guy on the app she talks to which is a little big of a red flag to me. We both share the same moral values. That's why I like her. She works as a church counselor. Other than her name, I only know but so much. She said her grandfather was ""the leader"" of their village which seemed like another red flag. I have no idea. I don't want to be hurt again but we keep talking like eventually something could happen. She is obviously into me and cares about my day and whether or not I have eaten. Maybe she is one of those ""I want to take care of him or fix him"" type of girls. No idea. I only know her first name and it's not like I have bugged her for information about her life. I know it was her cousin's birthday yesterday and that a friend of her's mother died and she has been comforting her. She also says that guys hit on her all the time but she ignores them. No idea of her past other than some guy who was obsessed with her was her first kiss. I mean, she is 27, but it is pretty crazy. That's all I know of her past. I'm just not sure how to go the next level with this girl. We seem to be headed towards a relationship but at the same time she says she wants to help me grow and eventually leave. She doesn't know what she wants though and for me that's another red flag. I don't want to waste my time but she is the most beautiful girl I have seen. That's why it is so blinding for me. She is only 4'11"" and I am 6'0"" so I'm not sure about that lol. It's just a lot of pros in cons. We get along together easily and she is easy going. I liked her the moment I saw her type of thing. She also updates her profile picture a lot. Just 1 photo and she deletes the old. She is a very private person and I think she is honestly afraid of the whole online thing because some men only want sex or could be fake as well. The fake Asian profiles I mentioned before will always have very photoshopped photos or some sort of model that is way too pretty. But she is in between and doesn't have to do much to make herself look pretty. Her photos aren't edited at all other than a generic color filter. That's how I am at least 65% sure she is genuine. Maybe she is just afraid of commitment or being in a relationship with someone far away.

I honestly don't know what else to add. Is it all too good to be true or did I actually find someone I should keep continuing to know? I get obsessive easily if I fall for a girl ",buzzsawjeremy,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1nsnoz2,Japanese girl slow response after first date.,"Hey. I have been texting a japanese girl for nearly 5 months now. And we have had phone calls every second week. she just moved to denmark for something called ""højskole"" it's a school where you stay and  do lots of social activites . She has always not been a fast replier. And she usally doesn't ask questions over text. but we talked on the times we talked over phone we had a really fun time. she just moved to denmark in september and is going to stay ontil january. I'm also going to japan this november for ""working holiday"" and she asked me over phone if i wanted to stay at her grandmothers house. she also offerd me to work at her fathers company. but resently after the first date her replies are 2 days after my message (meaning she haven't seen the message). and before it was one message per day. the date we went on was really fun and it looked like she had fun aswell. she gave me a premium handcream becasue apparently i mentioned it to her. and a kirby handcerchif (because she asked what i wanted as a gift for japan. if i wanted one) on the date she wanted me to learn her danish words. and wanted me to read a danish comic the bought. when i read the comic i acsendenlty spilled coffee on the side of her book. I apologized. and said i would buy a new one. but she refused and said she wanted to keep it as a momory of the date. i spilled on some of my clothes as well and she tryed to clean my shirt. and on the date she wanted to take pictures of me and one with her on it. on the date we also went for dinner at a ramen resturant. while we waited she wanted to show me pictures of her cats, family and her classmates from the school (she also sented me videos of her cats before she came to denmark) and told me that she would show me a place in japan when i go there. after dinner we when home. on the date she also asked me multible time if i was okay and gave me a chocole bar she got for her school trip (probbliy becasue i didn't eat a lot that morning). the date went on for at little over 5 hour before we parted ways. right after the date she sent a meesage telling me she had a nice day becasue of me. but after that date i asked her some days after if she wanted to meet near my home town. (becasue we live about 2-3 hour form each other). She said she didn't know when she would have time. but she would let me know when she plan to go to my town. i should note that she have never before said no or make excuses for calling on phone. and she was the one who hited at meeting on the date. this girl rarely inisiate conversations and if she does she usally sends photos of her dally live. but there can go op to 5 days or so.

so sorry if this was too long. but i like this girl but i dont know about her. i forgot to mention she is 29 and i'm 25. if it means something.

and i also forgot to say she told me she is introverted. and ithink i saw a picture of me on her phone",Aggravating-Let-4514,General consent ambiguity,Medium
t3_1ns889l,Feeling defeated and depressed,"Hello to anyone who stops by to read this. I’ll try to cut to the chase.

Over ten years ago, I made my first real friend at community college. We bonded over drawing, video games, and coffee, especially when we had classes together. Many guys found her attractive and constantly tried to show off, so I jokingly played the role of her “intimidating older brother” to keep them away. It actually worked, and even her real siblings didn’t mind. At that time, I didn’t have feelings for her yet.

After almost 2 years, she transferred to a college an hour away. That’s when I realized I had feelings. I could’ve confessed in the parking lot during our goodbye, but I didn’t—I was too scared of ruining our friendship.

A couple years later, she’d invite me to art nights or Smash Bros tournaments (we’d once been tag partners), but I couldn’t go because of school and lack of transportation. Eventually she moved farther north and went through a lot: unstable roommates, breakups, eviction, a car accident, and at one point working at a strip club just to survive. I worried, but she promised she’d stay safe. Much of this was during the pandemic, which made it harder.

Through it all, I kept holding on to her as “maybe the one.” My kindness had been taken for granted so many times by others, but she felt different. Years later, we finally had a phone call and caught up on everything. I confessed I had feelings back then, and she admitted she did too. She even said maybe there was still a chance for us. Our communication since then has been on and off, since life keeps us both busy.

Then I found out—through social media—that she had given birth about 3 years ago. I didn’t know until after the fact. The father was much older and quickly disappeared. It broke me for a couple weeks, but I eventually accepted it. She’s now in a better situation, surrounded by family, planning to go back to school to become a teacher while raising her child.

But just two days ago, I found out she’s expecting again. I messaged her, but haven’t gotten a reply yet. And now I’m stuck wondering: is she still worth fighting for? Or should I just move forward, accept my luck with relationships, and stop holding out hope?

Please know—this isn’t meant to defame her. I’m only sharing events as I remember them, to show how much I care about her well-being. I do love her platonically, though things are complicated when it comes to romance. I’d appreciate honest truths, insight, or opinions on whether I should keep trying, or finally let go.

t3_1nldx4g,Turns out I’m great at starting relationships… just not at keeping them ..,"I stumbled upon this subreddit and thought of using it as a platform to gain some perspective on my relationship struggles.

I’m 28, and like many people, I’ve had my share of relationship ups and downs. But lately, I feel stuck and unsure how to navigate things. 😕

In the past, I’ve been in two relationships and both were somewhat long-distance, and both ended suddenly.

My first relationship lasted for 3 years. At first, I was hesitant to get into it, but with time, she made me comfortable. Everything felt calm and steady  no major fights, no shouting, nothing dramatic. Even a week before the breakup, we had a great meetup. But out of nowhere, she called me and said she no longer had those feelings, and she wanted to separate because she didn’t want to cheat on me. I tried to talk her out of it during a few phone calls, but eventually I accepted it and didn’t bother her again.

At that age, I guess she just wanted to explore something else, and I respect that.

I met another girl a year later, and after being friends for about a year, I asked her if we could take it further. Things ended pretty quickly, within 3 months. The reason she gave was that her family was very wealthy and she couldn’t be with me, as I’m just a regular IT employee with a decent paycheck. This time I didn’t even try to stop her and I accepted her choice.

Interestingly, she reached out again after 5 years, after her breakup with someone else, but within a month or so we stopped talking again.

I keep wondering what I’m doing wrong. I’ve asked them directly, but I never got a clear answer, usually just “you deserve someone better.”

To be clear, neither of them were bad people, nor did they treat me badly. But it keeps happening again, and it’s left me confused.

I don’t consider myself an “alpha/beta/gamma male” type of person. I just wish to have a partner with whom I can travel, share thoughts, and enjoy the little things in life. But somewhere along the way, I feel like I might be doing something wrong that I haven’t recognized yet.

Right now, it feels like I’m just drifting through each day, still searching for a place to belong. 🍃",[deleted],General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1nk40ot,I’m so confused,"I recently met this girl at a bar, and right away the connection felt incredible. From that night on, we ended up spending time together every single day. Just a yesterday night, she actually initiated things between us, and we wound up sleeping together. That same day was one of the best I’ve had we went to an MLB game, then later found ourselves at a park overlooking all of New York, playing board games and just enjoying each other’s company.

The next morning felt even more meaningful. We spent hours talking, opening up, and connecting on a deeper level. Everything seemed to be going perfectly. We had already made plans to hang out again, so I texted her yesterday to say I’d come pick her up but I never got a response. Now it’s 5:34 in the morning, and I still haven’t heard from her.

I keep trying to convince myself not to overthink it, to stay positive but it’s been keeping me up at night. I can’t help but wonder did I do something wrong? Was the connection not what I thought it was? She told me, in her own words, that she liked me. She even made plans to come all the way to my city next month and seemed genuinely excited about it. That’s why I’m so confused right now.

The truth is, I really like her. To me, what we had felt real. But I also don’t want to come across as needy by double texting or calling. I’m just stuck, wondering what the right move is.",AdvisorBackground255,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1ngg2um,Am I crossing a line?,"I 39M am an Assistant Manager at a large corporate gas station. The store I work in is on the smaller side. Besides myself there is the General Manager and 5 cashiers. Typically there are two people working a time, (except during slow times a person will close alone)

Enter my dilemma, I work with a 37f who is an incredible woman. She is driven, has a great sense of humor and classically beautiful. She reminds me of a cat, won't give you the time of day until you prove you are not a garbage person. She dresses modestly and even though she has the looks to be stuck up she is humble. 

We banter back and forth and I am extremely careful to make sure that I am not crossing any lines and that she feels comfortable. Admittedly I treat her too friendly but there is just a wonderful electricity that comes when we (and i know this is cliché) make the SAME joke at the SAME time, word for word then even say the :

""Get out of my head!""
"" Jinks!""
 ""Double jinks!""

So finally here's the question. I happen to know that tomorrow is her birthday and she is a huge Tim Burton/Nightmare before Christmas fan. I ordered her a hoodie, and a set of Fischer price Nightmare before christmas little figures,  a funko pop and one of those Little Golddn Story books in which I wrote:

You are a rad individual, our shifts together bring me joy, hopefully you get some joy out of these for your birthday.

I think she's gunna love it but it begs the question, am I crossing a line?



Update
So as soon as I got to work she had been here for a couple hours so I told her to go outside and smoke, which gave me time to buy a 2 pack of hostess cupcakes put in a candle and shut the door to the backroom where they were lit.
Once she came in I asked her to grab me something from the back (which is odd because why wouldn't I just grab it myself) which built a small amount of tension..

But as soon as she opened the door it was all worth it.


I DID actually keep the book included because I didn't like have a card and I wanted her to have something to remind her that I think she is great. She gave me a hug (like the real kind that makes you feel something) so overall it was ☆☆☆☆☆",KitchenResident9606,Alcohol/substances,High
t3_1nf7e3c,I have no idea what to do for the second date,"I’m 20M and honestly have zero dating experience. I’ve only been on three first dates in my life, none of them successful, until last night. We grabbed pizza, and to my surprise conversation just flowed easily even though I’m usually pretty awkward. Afterwards we went to a grocery store and she (20F) showed me some of her favorite foods, which was actually really fun.

This morning I texted her saying I had a great time and would love to take her out again. She said she enjoyed it too and would love a second date. Now I’m kind of stuck. Dinner felt like an easy option, but I have no idea what else would be fun and simple, especially since I’m living in Madrid right now. I’m also a little worried about keeping conversation going. On the first date I learned a lot about her interests, background, family, music, movies, hobbies, all that, so I’m not sure what to talk about next time.

Another thing is I’ve never been in a relationship. I haven’t flirted much or made any physical moves, and I don’t want her to think I’m not interested. At the same time I don’t know if I should admit I’ve never dated before, since she has a lot more experience than me. Honestly I don’t even know how to kiss or when you’re supposed to go for it.

So now I’m trying to figure out where to take her, how to keep the conversation flowing, and whether or not I should tell her about my lack of relationship experience.",Specific_Device5618,General dating / relationship,Low
t3_1neg24b,She needs time and that confuses me,"Hey everyone,
I (18M) really need some advice. There’s this girl (18F) I’ve been into for about 3 months — we’ve been texting every day, we’ve hung out multiple times (sushi, drinks, walk), and there’s definitely chemistry. She was comfortable with me holding her hand, leaning on me etc. She told me she really does like me (and I'm sure she means it seriously), but she says she’s not ready to move into a relationship right now.

I told her I’ll respect that, give her space, and wait. So right now, I would like to keep spending time with her, maybe take her on small trips, and focus on building trust and good memories together. I really like her, she's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, and I’m willing to fight for her, but I’m scared that during this “waiting period” she’ll either lose interest in me or end up with someone else. But it's propably just my mind creeping out.

Do you think there’s actually a chance this turns into a relationship, or am I just setting myself up to get hurt?

I’ve apologized, and after about a year we started talking again. But after graduation, we lost touch. We were supposed to meet up during the summer to talk, but it never happened. The truth is, I’ve wanted to tell her everything that I’ve been in love with her since the day we met, that I know I can do better and be better, that I want to be the person she deserves instead of the one she got back then. When I didn’t hear from her all summer, I assumed she had moved on and didn’t want to hear from me. That was another mistake.
