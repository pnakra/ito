1r2e3ki,Is it normal to feel strongly attracted to a guy?,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"To get to the point, I met someone through the internet (walking green flag) and I really clicked with them. But I never actually felt like this before to someone? I have dated before (6 past relationships) but it never made sense to me until now? And what’s even worse is that he’s drop dead handsome. So I like how he looks as well as his personality. Ik this is going to sound like that my lobster is too buttery and my steak is too juicy but I am wondering if it’s normal to feel this strongly to someone now??? And would I eventually get hurt from this? "
1r2b8lb,how much is normal to spend on valentine's day?,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I made up a valentine's basket for my (not official boyfriend, but we both really like each other so hopefully soon 🤞), and i'm starting to doubt myself as to whether I spent too much or not enough? I don't want to seem silly by giving him too much, but I want to try and make it special because this is our first valentine's day together and my first valentine ever 😭 I spent about $80 aud, this is what I got him:

lego roses set

a heat reactant mug w/ his favourite characters on it

2 pairs of socks with more characters 

a plushie

chocolates (valentine's ferreros, chocolate rose, bunch of little chocolate bars/other sweets, sour patch kids bag and reese's bag)

and i'm about to make him a card. is this too much?? or not enough? I don't want to come off looking like an idiot, I usually wouldn't spend that much on anything but i'm about to start an apprenticeship so i'll have a bit of an income soon and figured I kind of had the money to spare 🤞 what do you think?

1r28lha,"Weird habits/urges with looking at girl's butts, what should I do?",Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"For starters, I'm a male and a freshmen, this has been a habit that has been going on for a while. This did start back in middle school however it was not an issue since I've hardly done it. Many girls in my school have a habit of wearing tight leggings or any other kinds of pants etc. And now I'm getting frequent urges to look and sometimes give in and glance for a split second. Now it's important to mention I'm not very social and I'm looked upon as the quiet kid with some sort of disorder (At least from how I see it). And this is a major cause for concern as you don't know what people think of you and what you do can impact your image greatly than you think. Of course I know for someone of my age, this is normal and expected, however I feel extremely guilty upon giving in, as I feel like this is a violation of their privacy and respect as a person. Especially since I'm trying to become friends with someone who is dating someone else and I previously (and still do) have a crush on. I want to stop and save it for when I get into a relationship, but I'm finding it to be quite challenging, and I'm afraid one mistake and action upon something I'm desperately trying to avoid, can severely paint a negative reputation on me in my school. Is anyone having the same issues as me, what should I do to stop?"
1r288o8,Idk what to do about my gf anymore,Advice,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"My girlfriend is in Italy rn until may. We’ve been together for a little over a year and she moved in October 

It was all fine until recently. she’s been going out for a while and it was literally fine, she would tell me abt guys that hit on her and tell me how she told them she has a bf and blah blah. but she’s now like barely putting effort in and it’s drastically different from how she used to be like. I literally just feel like we’re friends atp and the only time she acts like we’re actually together is when she’s drunk, that’s the only time she wants me it feels like. Last week some guy she met when she was out (she got his social media and said it was cuz he wanted help learning Portuguese) asked her to go to out with his friends and she was gonna go and I was like wtf? I explained how I felt and asked how she’d feel if I did this and she was like “yeah ur right” and asked if I didn’t want her to go and whatever. So she knows how I feel about this kind of thing.

Today she tells me she’s going out with these guys she met at a bar with her friends (so she got their social media like bro) and I said “just you and the guys?” And she said “yeah Miranda comes later” and she literally already knows how I feel about this so I just said like okay idc it’s fine because why am I fighting for this. I’ve already talked to her about how I feel about that and yet she keeps doing it, same with the no effort thing. I asked her before if she feels different after moving and she said “I feel a bit disconnected but I know once I see you again it’ll go back to normal like the last time and I know I love you and don’t want to breakup I’m sure of that”. I’m visiting her in March.

I just don’t know what to do anymore, my day literally gets ruined the second I wake up just because of her. This is so stupid and annoying because I love her so much and I just want to actually feel like I have a girlfriend again. I’ve decided to js act like idc until I actually don’t care anymore or until she realizes what she’s doing which I doubt she will. I just straight up don’t know what to do anymore, talking to her doesn’t do anything apparently and she just doesn’t seem to care about how I feel and I’m sick of it. like do I continue to act like idc or idk what should I do in this I really don’t want to breakup I just want her to be normal again"
1r283b3,Can this kind of situation happen in public,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Is it just me or is it normal to be worried about if say you get an angry face look  by someone like someone is say worried that you have bad intentions and that you are a bad person like say for example if this happens in a mall, public transport (metro, bus etc) and does this  situation even happen like say you are Egyptian and male if that changes anything 
"
1r27sjf,For the boys,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"This is not for the good looking ones, but for the average and below average looking guys. 

How many times in your life have you guys been complimented. Be it on your appearance, your work, or just in general as a person. 

Today I realised this again that the normal looking guys or the introverts and shy type of guys most often never get compliments in their life. I asked a friend of mine who really a good guy, he's the best I would say that I have met in my university. I asked him how many times have you got compliments, or have you been appreciated, his reply struck me with a wave of sadness. Dude has never gotten even a single compliment. And there are many others who are the same as him. Even i have got it just once till now, that too years ago.

I just wanted to say you guys that you all are doing good and I just wanna say even if dont get one make sure you compliment others, it can surely make someone's day a lot better.

Saying this because getting compliments is very rare in my country."
1r22zrf,yo guys... idk what's wrong but hopefully you can explain,Advice,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I'm 16|M, I am considered very good in academics by peers and teachers alike , but for some reason, i just can't seem to be able to watch the lectures if i am alone or not under pressure. I really want to study and if I don't watch those lectures I am def gonna fail. I mean I really know i have to study, and I think I want to study too. but I just can't focus. or sometimes,  I just don't even try. Even now, I'm playing the lecture in the background to avoid the guilt but barely anything is being registered in my brain.

I also think that i got memory issues because, last week, i forgot where i put my watch(it was worth a lot) , and ended up losing it because i can't remember where it is. i am also constantly losing my pens, keys,  and i keep forgetting people's names and stuff. 

 I've been rotting in my bed for some time and i just can't find the momentum to do anything. It's really hard for me to even get up from my bed and brush my teeth and stuff.... its weird but i don't know how to change either   
i also tried to do many things ( like guitar, chess, skating, karate ) and ended up quitting it because well i have no idea why...

1r1ziwd,does anyone else deal with this?,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"when I was in high school, I didn’t really have that much of a filter. by that I mean, I was able to freely make jokes and freely show my funny side. 

now in college, I find myself putting a filter on most of the things that I say, and watching what I say to avoid judgment and ridicule, whether the ridicule is joking or not

Maybe for me specifically it’s the environmental change, which *has* taken a toll on how I act. but it could also be just normal teen angst, which is why I’m asking you guys."
1r1vywu,Does anyone else think friend Valentines are kinda brutal 😭,Discussion,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Valentine’s Day is coming up, and honestly… I’m already a little stressed about it.

In Japan, it’s not just about giving chocolate to someone you like. Friends exchange sweets too.

It sounds fun until you actually start thinking about who to give them to.

Do you ever have someone in your friend group that you don’t dislike and talk to normally, but you are not sure how close you really are?

Like, they are part of the group, but you don’t hang out much and you are not especially close.

Every year I end up wondering if I should prepare something for them too.

If I don’t, I might seem cold.

But if I do, I start questioning whether I actually see them as a close friend.

Valentine’s is supposed to be fun, but sometimes it weirdly makes you aware of the distance between people.

This year I decided to only give sweets to the friends I’m genuinely close with.

But I still feel kinda guilty about it.

Is this normal?

Am I overthinking it?

What would you do?"
1r1qdys,Does love even exist in highschool anymore 😭??,Rant,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Like dude I hear all these cute little love stories from people in highschool back then and then I see highschool sweethearts, and I'm just confused on why that's just more rare now. It feels like relationships are just games to other teens now, I remember freshman year there was this girl in my class who had multiple guys she was talking to at a time as ""backup plans"" if things didn't work out with her boyfriend, like girlie I can't even pull a guy of my own 😭. And it's so normalized for people to cheat on each other along with people thinking their partner is cheating or accusing them of cheating.

And then there's people at my school who just have 7+ exes, like you are not Ramona Flowers. My crush specifically has had a ton of exes and went through two partners in one year last year and he ended up leading me on this year and ended up dating another girl, my friend says he tends to do this a lot and this relationships are typically short term. Maybe I'm just like naive or something but I just think it's really weird and kind of messed up how people our age treat relationships and how mean we can be to each other. It just feels like so many people are so fake, y'know?"

1r1c8rs,Thinking of asking for help for my eating- needing some advice (tw numbers),Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"hello, just thought id come on here and say that im thinking of asking for help and was wondering if anyone had any advice or anything to share on the matter!! 

so for a bit of background im a 16f and ive struggled with depression for about year and a half. in the summer I started to obsess over my body which turned into calorie counting in September and now very restrictive, disordered eating. Recently ive started camhs counselling for my depression but no one knows about my eating struggles (everyone assumes its reduced appetite because of depression but its not just that). ive come to a couple realisations 
1) I wont be able to recover from depression when I'm battling with my eating
2) its genuinely impacting my health and my health anxiety is through the roof. I had some stomach issues in a public place a couple of weeks ago and its genuinely scared me alot.

the way im going about asking for help is that im requesting some blood tests. I had some done 2 months ago that came back as satisfactory bar my white blood cell count which came back as low (so ive got to get that repeated anyway). but rather than just getting that done, im gonna ask for everything else to be repeated too. my theory is that they should've gotten worse by now (as ive been eating alot less and for alot longer then I was then). if they come back as abnormal, my plan is to admit to why. I then dont know what the next steps are, I suppose it depends exactly how the bloods come back so if anyone has any knowledge whatsoever on this then pls lmk! other helpful physical health information might be that my bmi is &gt;!15.6!&lt; and I have a low, slightly irregular heart rate and a low blood pressure. im not sure whether ill have to get further health checks, be monitored, im not sure?

if they come back as normal I think this is where I'll struggle as I won't feel validated enough. ive only struggled with this illness for 5 months so a big part of me doesn't feel sick enough. however, ive still written out like a letter thing that ill use in explaining to my mum why I was so desperate for blood tests. again, I dont know what happens once I admit to my eating struggles in this way, so if anyone knows then lmk. maybe we could contact 111 and tell them all my physical health symptoms and ask them for advice? (I have more health concerns than ive mentioned in this post so if you think that'd also be helpful then dont hesitate to ask)

another big current concern is refeeding syndrome as I think my body is probably lacking alot of nutrients as for the whole of this year ive only been eating around &gt;200-600!&lt; calories a day. is this something that either the gp or my mum will have to consider if I tell them? and what is the likelihood ill have to be put on a meal plan of some sort?

if anyone has any advice or anything useful then please please share, honestly the more help, the more likely i am to tell my mum. I am absolutely terrified but I want to get better for me and for my future and for my family. my mum is my favourite person and she can already see that im getting skinnier and undereating. I can't do this to her any longer."

1r0sj8g,What Would You Do in This Situation (Advice),Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I’m posting this because I feel like I’m losing my grip on what’s normal, and I need to get everything out in one place. I am 16F, and this was an online relationship, not IRL. Here’s the full timeline of the last five weeks, because everything kept piling up so fast I didn’t have time to process any of it and I’m still struggling to figure out what to do.

⸻

Timeline

•	Jan 8: I started dating Caz. From the beginning, we talked constantly and emotionally bonded really  fast. We supported each other and I developed feelings so quickly it shocked even me. 

•	Jan 18: I know he was talking to his ex, who he’d broken up with on Jan 1st (also an online relationship). At first I was fine with it, but then I noticed they were talking more and more and eventually Jay joined the relationship as a poly (which I was totally fine with). I tried to be open-minded and mature about it, but the first “red flag” is that he asked her to join before even asking me if I was okay with it.

•	Over the next couple of weeks, there was near-constant arguing, miscommunication, and emotional stress. The first week was perfect but it just deteriorated from there. I kept trying to fix things and hold the relationship together while my boundaries were repeatedly tested.

•	Jan 29: Me and Jay both found out that Caz had been cheating on us IRL with someone for the entire duration of our relationship up to that point. He’d gotten and was dating a girl IRL since December 12th (he was with Jay at the time too). This completely shattered everyone’s  trust. I stayed because he expressed guilt, self-awareness, and remorse, and because I had seriously fallen for him. He did sorta come clean and I’m pretty forgiving. Jay also stayed, but I think she was feeling a bit attention deprived. 

•	Feb 4: Jay added her ex, Noisy, into the situation. This escalated everything. Caz was fine with it with some conditions and I usually let him make the decisions anyway. This was her ex from between her and Caz’s breaks from Jan 1st to like Jan 10th or smth. 

•	Feb 5: Caz kicked Noisy out due to the conflict he caused. I won’t really get into that it was a bit minor. 

•	But even after that, things didn’t stabilize. Jay and I were arguing nonstop, largely due to unresolved tension, and probably some jealousy. She felt left out we tried including her… man it was just a tough situation tbh. I feel like all 3 of us weren’t communicating properly (no shame but it was mostly Jays poor communication).

•	Feb 7: Jay left / we broke up with her. One of the reasons given was that she “wasn’t really attracted to me,” which hurt deeply on top of everything else. Well not still romantically but not physically, but it would just complicate things further. 

•	After Jay left, things briefly felt calmer, and I thought maybe the worst was finally over.

•	Feb 9 (today): I found out Caz has been cheating on me again IRL for the past 3–4 days. This is the second time in less than a month that I’ve discovered cheating. I mean how many girls does he have??

•	This triggered another emotional collapse. He expressed intense guilt and self-loathing, and I found myself comforting him (I mean I feel really bad for him, it’s not easy having a bunch of girl chasing after you and stuff). I mean he apologized and said yada yada he’s sorry and needs physical touch but he should’ve just told me. I actually don’t mind if he goes out with other girls if he would just freaking tell me!! I’m upset about the lying. I mean in my opinion it’s not cheating if you quickly own up to it. And I only found out through the last girl he cheated with since they all go to the same school together 

•	At this point, I feel emotionally exhausted.

—-

I don’t know if I should stay. I care about him deeply, and I know he’s struggling, but I’m also realizing how much of myself I’ve been sacrificing just to keep things from falling apart. I feel drained, confused, and unsure whether this relationship is helping either of us anymore—or if I’m just afraid to let go after investing so much emotionally.

I just needed somewhere to put this where it could exist outside my head. I love him so much I’ve already forgiven him, I just want what’s best for him. I’m pretty sure the girl he’s cheating on me with has or is about to find out he is and is being told by the last girl he was cheating with me with. So ye. It’s probably over between them. I guess I’m happy we are still together, I’m just worried he’s going to get rid of me :( or he likes new girl better. But we called and had a good time tonight I think he’s just really stressed I feel so bad for him. If anyone has advice on how to make him feel better and stuff pls lemme know."
1r0r2vo,To the girls out hear,Social,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"this is a un usually question but I want to know the answer 

does your b\*obs grow bigger and become shorter time to time. I have seen a lot of girls in my class year ago they ware flat after 6 months after Sem holiday it grown crazy and now it is normal. and there are lot of girls who have jugs on them. 

For the people who can't read in my English with typo 

-- chatgpt shit
Do breasts change in size over time? I’ve noticed that some girls in my class were flat earlier, but after about six months (after the semester holiday), their breast size increased a lot and later seemed to return to a more normal size. I’ve also noticed that some girls naturally have larger breasts.

1r0o64t,"Girl asked me to prom, but I think its a joke.",Discussion,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"There was a girl who were gonna call J(her name does not start with a J)

about nine months ago, we hooked up at a party and since then we text occasionally and I see her in person once in a while (she lives close to me). 

Todays convo:

J: im hosting a party in march

Me: can i go?

J: its a post prom

J: were doing tenting

Me: whats tenting?

J:\*explains\*

Me: ah

Me: well I dont even have a prom date

(this is where it gets weird)

J: \*in text\* My name: do you wanna go to prom?

J: \*in text\* J: yes i do

(normal)

Me: do you wanna go to prom?

J: yeah!

Now, she is a but of a hoe, and one of our mutuals told me this sound like bs, so i ask, do you think i am being led on?"
1r0hot8,I don’t like my friend and I can’t stand her anymore,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I have a friend who I used to be very close with a year ago. She was alright at first and in fact,we got along really well cus her brain processes very fast and can catch up with my autistic ahh thoughts easily,without me needing to mask myself.

However,I started to notice that she always looks down on people,a lot. She is a very smart girl but she refuses to claim that title, not in a humble way tho cus she calls everyone who gets lower grades than her either lazy or stupid. 

This is actually driving me crazy because wdym you are the normal one here and literally every other human being is just dumb?? Like hello? 

Yes I tried to address this to her by telling her that she is indeed smart and different people have different abilities, yet she proceeded to tell me that she reckons everyone can pass if they tried hard enough, and she defines trying hard as chatting in lessons then study for 1 hour after school. 

Also,she gets all weird whenever I get higher grades than her, and I feel pressured to tell her what I got and basically compete with her very often. Whenever I share news of mine academically, she either says “oh that’s good” all bitterly or tries to redirect the topic onto how she had done in that test instead.

I am honestly so fed up of her and want to end the friendship, however all my other friends seem to not notice her ego taller than the Himalayas and adore her very much.Therefore I can’t really cut her off which just annoys me more. "
1r0jnte,My online best friend blocked me again,Discussion,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I was friend with this girl online (completly platonic btw) who eventually became my bsf, not i like I have much friends, I used to tell her everything, she was the kind to sometimes roast me ig as a joke but I never rly did, then one time I was raigebaiting her, thinking she was playing along, then tried said she's stupid as a joke and she blocked me, I was left so heartbroken cuz I only knew her online, so I couldn't contact her in any way, it felt sm worst than a break up, I felt empty for weeks, having no one to tell what I was going through, but eventually I moved on.


Then a couple months later she texted me again, saying she's rly sorry, and that she sometimes gets rly mad and randomly blocks people, that she's working on her self, and she just felt too bad to text me again. She also said she met a guy, and that she didn't know if he would be fine with it, but she could talk to him if I wanna be friends again, but that I don't have to cuz she just wanted to apologize. I told her I forgive her, but idk about being friends again if that'll cause problems with her bf, I think she said she'll talk to him or smtg that implied that, idk, anw, we started talking again, I thought it was awkward at first, but eventually got back to normal, became even closer than before, even found a common dream (still platonic with a p). 

Anw it was going good, until she stopped anwsering these couple days, texted her today, she just said im sorry my bf isn't comfortable with me talking to you, you were a good friend, then blocked me from everywhere again.


Im still confused rn, It doesn't feel as bad as the first time, myb I got used to people blocking or ghosting me, but I still feel a bit empty. I just don't get it, how can someone be so heartless, not only the reason is stupid cuz I literally told her when she first texted me that I wouldn't wanna be friends if that's not good with her bf, but thats not the worst, it's the way she did it, she couldn't have a mature conversation explaining the situation to me, I would've never insisted if that would hurt her relationship, but no, she just, out of nowhere, send one text telling everything at once, then blocked me before I even got the chance to anwser, like could someone with a heart ever do this?"

So in the last two years I began to loose interest in my life. I dont wanna do anything. Everytime I do something on my weekend like going out with friends, I think I wasted my ""relaxing"" time. I'd just spend all the time in bed and think its good. 

And then this year I realised. I dont think I am living for me. I dont see a reason to live. Id be okay with dying right now. I am not scared of death. I am simply just existing for other people. I dont care when someone says ""You only life once"". I am demotivated like almost all the time.

Sometimes im more motivated for example when I can go do Gymnastics (old hobby). Its like im having up and downs.

It has gotten physical only on one occasion, where I was like 9 years old on a lot of antidepressants that made me worse, and I feel immense guilt over it even after being forgiven and reassured my mom doesn’t hold a grudge over me for it. In my nightmares, my mother and I argue, and one of us ends up not-alive. I wake up and feel terrified or like I’ve find something wrong, sick go my stomach. Is this a normal symptom of childhood trauma/abuse, or should I seek more help for it? 

This is what the NSFW warning/trigger warning is for. 

I have experienced SA multiple times in my life. The first time, my mother’s boyfriend (not my current stepfather.) had SA’d me while my mother slept a few feet away. It has fucked me up for my whole life, and I have ended up having a natural initial fear and disdain and suspicion of every single man I have ever met. Even family. Except for my stepdad. I have never (since I was five years old) ever been scared that he would hurt me in that way. That being said, he was verbally aggressive towards me and my mom and half sister (his bio daughter) when I was younger. He’s since backed off from me and my younger sister, and understandably argues with my mom most hours of the day. As the title suggests, even though I know my stepdad would never do something like that, I still have nightmares of him SA’ing me. Further, I’ve recently become acquainted with one of his friends. The friend had only met me once before and bought me Expedition 33 for Christmas. I immediately thought “oh. Does he like kids? 😕 you don’t usually do that for a kid you only met once when they were like 14” but I pushed it aside. I talked to my grandma about the friend buying me the game and she was like “does he like kids? 😡” and my stepdad has reassured us “hell no. (Friend) would burn down a house over somebody touchin a kid.” My birthday party was recent and the friend bought me LOTR illustrated, including all three books. Earlier January, we (me, stepdad, friend) had seen the extended movies in theaters. I have never seen LOTR, let alone extended. It was great, I wanted to lead it, so stepdads friend bought me the book. I thanked him and was very happy.

Last night, for the first time in a while, I had a bad dream about adults in my life. It was my stepdad and the friend doing about what you’d think they would. I woke up and just cried, feeling like there was something wrong with me. I don’t know why these dreams happen. I don’t enjoy them, which you could think I might because “why else would they feel guilt?” I feel bad because I just do. 

I forgot to mention, but the friend met me when we were moving houses, and I had to ride in his truck alone with him to move some stuff. I did have a voice in the back of my head be slightly scared, but I trusted him. Nothing bad happened, the guy has actually said “idk how you put up with your parents arguing all the time. I’m sorry if that’s not an appropriate thing for me to say, but god, kid.” And I’ve never told anybody that other than my grandma. 

I forgot to mention I’ve also had these bad dreams about seemingly good men involving teachers I trust, other family members, and family friends. 

Is there something wrong with my head, or is this normal based off of the things I’ve endured when I was younger? 

No TLDR. I feel like most of this is important. "
1qzwcmv,Feeling emotionally drained because of family conflicts（it's a long story if you don't mind）,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"feeling down lately because of how my grandmother treats my mom and the household.

A while ago, my grandmother was sick, and during that time everyone’s mood was very tense. After she came to stay at our house, her temper was worse than before, and she had argued with my mom in the past. This morning, I heard the voices of my mom and grandmother getting louder and louder. My grandmother said that things weren’t clean enough, that some things should be replaced, or that the house didn’t feel like a “proper home.” Her tone got more and more intense, and it felt less like giving advice and more like applying pressure.
Financially, we are okay. If something really breaks, we replace it, but if it still works, we continue using it. I don’t understand why my grandmother insists on replacing things that are still perfectly fine.
I told my dad about how this affects me and the household atmosphere, but he said, “You have to respect elders,” and said he didn’t understand what I was saying. He even said things like, “So you think grandma is causing trouble for your mom?” or “Do I have to die before things will calm down?”
Later, my dad also explained his own feelings. He knows how hard my mom works and doesn’t want conflicts, but I don’t think every issue should be ignored.
My dad has had a lot of struggles too. He originally had a normal job, but the company seemed to be closing, so he left. His mood completely changed, he stopped eating properly, and he lost weight. After getting home from work in the past, he would go out drinking for several hours. Sometimes he drank so much that he didn’t seem like himself, almost addicted to alcohol. Later, when my grandmother returned, she went to where he was drinking and scolded him, and after that he rarely drank like that again. Grandma didn’t want him to drink like that. He had been like that since he was young, and after my mom married him, he was still like that. She gave up trying to manage him. Later, after I was born, they started acting more like parents. If I weren’t there, I think this family might have already split up, maybe divorced.
After their argument ended today, I went to my room to eat. My grandmother asked me what was wrong, but I was actually very sad and didn’t want to respond. Later, my mom came out and said, “Grandma also has a point,” in a tone that felt a little provocative. This made me feel even worse. I didn’t want to hear them arguing, so I loudly told them to be quiet. I really couldn’t handle any more.
I’m not trying to disrespect my grandmother; I just hope that when people speak, they can show more respect and consideration toward my mom.
I know they both have their own difficulties, but because of this family, they have to hold it together. I still love my family, and they love me too, but I hope they won’t argue over small things."

1qzhrrx,Did my shyness ruin my teenage years or is this more common than I think?,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I’m 18 and I’ve noticed something about myself that’s been bothering me. I’ve had almost zero interaction with girls. Like maybe 5–7 conversations in the past few years.

 Even when I’m walking and a girl is coming from the opposite side, I usually avoid eye contact because I don’t want to seem creepy. But at the same time, I feel like this level of shyness isn’t normal. There was also a girl I was really attracted to for a long time, but we were in different classes and I never talked to her. Now it’s over and I kind of regret not even trying.

 Is this normal at this age, or am I way behind socially?"
1qzq6p5,I need prom advice,Advice,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I need prom advice

My girlfriend (17f, Junior) and I (18f, Senior), have been talking about prom for a while now. We've been together for almost 2 years so we've had our fair share of school dances. But there's an issue with the prom dresses.

Basically, I've always hated wearing dresses, and I just finally did the big chop and cut off my hair. I feel like myself so much, and I'm really breaking into the masc fashion and finding what I'm comfy in. I'm done being forced to wear shit I don't feel good in, and swore I'd never wear a dress again. All I want are senior prom pictures I don't look at a week later and despise because I'm in a dress and I hate it.

My girlfriend is also masc, but she lives in a really judgmental household and cannot cut her hair or wear anything but a dress or it'll be hell for her.

And recently she texted me and said, 'I'm really sorry that this sounds so controlling and bad, but if you don't wear a dress with me I don't think I can go to prom because I can't be alone in that'.

I don't know what to do. She compares herself to me a lot and is generally insecure because her outsides don't match her insides very well and normally I'd do literally anything for her but I'm just having trouble sacrificing my own self-confidence after I've finally found it, and never having a prom photo I feel good about. But I also feel guilty leaving her on her own with these similar feelings. And I don't want to go to prom without her.

What do I do guys 🥲"
1qzdgwk,Should I ask for a blank slate (I’m turning 14 in a week and she’s 13 btw),Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Two months ago, my first real love broke up with me. She was my love, my life, my best friend, my everything.

We had our first fight two days prior. After the fight, I was devastated that I hurt her and was hurt as well. I texted her “I love you“ later, to no response. I wanted to try to make up with her the next morning, but she ignored and avoided me the whole day, until I finally was able to sit down and talk to her. At the end, I thought everything was OK again, and we texted like normal afterschool. I sent her the “gn love you!“ that we sent each other every night, but was met with just a good night. I wasn’t sure if she was still recovering from the fight or what, but it gave me an uneasy feeling. The next morning, she broke up with me.

I was devastated. It felt like the world was over. Just later that day, she texted me that she really wanted to be friends with me. I was still in love with her, and I would do anything at the time to get her back, so I agreed, hoping it would be the first step to getting back together. We then tried to be friends for around a week or two, and we still talked all the time, until she told me that the nagging doubts about whether she shouldve broken up with me were not really there anymore. I was really upset and sent her something like ”don’t be surprised if I never talk to you again.” She asked me to explain why, and I told her that I thought being friends was the first step to getting back together. She said that I must’ve never cared about her and to not talk to her.

I felt terrible the next couple of days, and told her I was sorry in a really long text, but to no response. A couple weeks went by, and we eventually tried to fix things, and be friends again. I was definitely still in love with her, and I even told her that I love her when we were trying to be friends. A couple days into us trying to be friends again, she told me that I was wonderful and that she felt some of what we had before coming back. I was ecstatic, I thought that maybe I had a chance. But over the next couple days, I realized that I was chasing nothing, but I would keep on chasing it anyways. I even had some suicidal thoughts, and eventually decided to cut it off, for the sake of my mental health.

I sent her a couple of messages in the weeks to come asking her how she was doing, and she did respond. But overall, I was still feeling pretty terrible. Eventually, I asked if we could just be chill with each other, and a couple days later, she responded first of all thanking me (I had also apologized for a lot of things in that message) and then telling me there was something important she wanted to tell me in person first. I was like, sure, and was waiting for her to tell me that she had been waiting weeks to say. Eventually I got to the point where I was seeking her out to talk to her, but still never got the opportunity. I realized that this was bad, that I was seeking her out, so then I took it out on her by telling her that I didn’t want to hear it anymore and being overall a little mean. I said sorry afterwards, and that she could still tell me if she wanted, but to no response. That was a week or two ago now.

The other day, I said “hey sophie… i know i’ve done some shit but… it kills me to see you look at me like that… i mean…i’m not asking for your forgiveness, but i just wanted to say i’ll always be here. take your time.” also to no response, as I expected.

I still quite often think about her and have crashes of feeling absolutely terrible, recently followed by chest pain.

I feel really bad about how I hurt her and just feel like we can’t leave things here. Plus I have to see her everyday at school which is terrible.

So I’ve been thinking, should I ask her if, once we’re both ready, if I can have a blank slate, and start again?"

1qzceg1,Ripping my pants while visiting a graveyard (storytime),Meme,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I don't know if this is a right sub to post it but I have no where else to do so. (Art drawn by me)

So this just happened to me today, and I'm still emotionally recovering. 
My family and I were visiting a graveyard in our city to clean up the graves  of our deceased relatives and recite a religious chapter for them. The graves of each of my relatives are scattered all over the place, so we had to keep moving around by using my uncle's pickup truck since the place was fairly big.


 After each visit, we would get in the car and drove to the our next relative's grave. Not everyone fit inside the pickup truck, so me and my older cousin had to sit in the cargo area. She climbed up first. Then it was my turn.The moment I lifted my leg to climb up, I heard a LOUD ripping sound and my pants ripped on the spot
‎

And it's not just a small tear. It was a full on catastrophic failure. pelvic area to butt cheeks, completely open. There was no saving it.
‎I had no choice but to sit there quietly in the cargo area, desperately pulling my shirt down while my cousin laughed her ass off at me. My other family members inside the truck had no idea yet.
‎


‎When we arrived and parked, I immediately told them about it. They didn’t believe it was that bad and told me to keep following them, until I showed them a small part of the ripped pants (not all of it, obviously). Cue the emergency family meeting. So obviously there were no clothing stores nearby. We were at a graveyard with mostly forest around it.
‎


‎Then my great-uncle had a genius idea to use a random oversized black T-shirt that had been living in the pickup truck for god knows how long. And the plan was to tuck the shirt into the front of my pants like a shitty apron, then lower my pants a bit so the rip “wouldn’t be obvious”. But What actually happened is that my pants were sagging at my ankles and the shirt tucked into my pants as an apron kept falling off every five minutes when we were walking. 
‎


‎To make it worse, I was wearing a cap and a soccer jersey. I genuinely looked like a lost homeless guy or a Crip gang member. And I still had to walk with my family deep inside the graveyard. in public. For hours. I'm not even walking normally, I was waddling like a penguin or something. People stared. I stopped feeling embarrassed because I had clearly reached the maximum level of embarrassment. 
‎


‎But you know what made it worse? the back side of my pants are still uncovered that whole time, so my bare ass cheeks are still exposed for the public to see. you can't even pretend not to see it since it was basically THAT big of a rip. also my underwear was unfortunately the same color as my skin. At that point, I didn’t care anymore. Whoever saw my bare ass living or deceased saw it.
‎

(That's all, hope I didn't waste y'all's time lol)

1qyg6mk,I Made an Electrokinesis and Super Speed Superhero OC But I Need Name Ideas,Art,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Why did I made an electric and super speed superhero? Speed and electricity manipulation are my favorite superpowers that’s why. The other masks are just somethings more of a “what if”, why did I make them? Notice his mask doesn’t have any holes? How can he breathe? That’s why, I might need some help picking one. His design was based on Cyclops if you didn’t know. I wanted to make superheroes mainly because I got inspired by Invincible. Also I already have an idea of an entire superhero team and maybe a series with this guy as the main character. Like a total of 8 members. Maybe first a comic series. I am also thinkg of a name for the team, I’m thinking like Ace Order, Ace Defense, Ace Syndicate, Ace Guardian Team, Ace Protectors, Ace Powerhouses, something with Ace, it just sounds cool. Also of their government that promotes them like Shield from Avengers or GDA from Invincible. I’m thinking like: COPP Consolidation of Planet Protection, Consolidation of Public Protection COHP Consolidation of Human Protection COGP Consolidation of Global Protection, something with Consolidation. The Director I also thought of a name but I bet you all don’t want to hear it. Anyway back to this guy.

So again, he has super speed, how fast can he run? Well there’s some levels of him if I make a series. First he runs near lighting speed, the more the series progress, he can run faster than lightning, maybe near the end, as fast or faster than light. His super speed is different from his electrokinesis that’s why his speed is way more however electricity does make him faster. He just trains his legs and cardio a lot. He’s also a kicker fighter, his fighting style is a mix of Taekwondo, Kickboxing, and Wrestling, he mostly used Taekwondo. Capoeira? Nah, he doesn’t do Capoeira. He’s pretty fast and light at kicking. His electrokinesis allows him to manipulate electricity obviously, being able to shoot, absorb, release and charge electricity. He can overdrive and charge technology or deplete their batteries. He can also produce magnetic effects. I might make him like a Logia from One Piece but he might get a bit too overpowered. His electrictiy is connected with his energy so he can’t keep running around much or else he’ll use it all, his stamina (he does a lot of cardio) is very high but still tries to conserve it. He can also fly and he’s fast but he’s much slower compared to on the ground but it does save energy. His strength and endurance is okay but compared to superhumans… it’s not bad… but not the best either. But still better than nothing. 

Here’s the names I’ve been thinking of: 

Overcharge, Hypercharge, Over Surge, Hyper Surge, Power Supply, Hyper Shock, Energizer, Energy Man, Great Spark, Captain Charge, The Charged, Drastic Shock, Amplifix, Ohmi, Severe Surge, Super Surge, Powerhouse, Voltrix, Voltiplier, Conductinator, Static Devil, Static Angel, Shocking Hazard, Hazard, Surge Demon, Surge Angel, Nitro Surge, Static Blitz, Charge Blitz, Swift Circuit, Swift Charge, Swift Current, Quick Current, Turbo Static, Turbo Circuit, Turbolt, Turbo Thunder, Hyper Thunder, Quick Thunder, Lightning Strike, Great Lightning , Statication.

A lot as you can see, I was going to go with Overcharge but apparently that was taken so I decided to go with other names. Right now I’m leaning towards the first 5: Overcharge, Hypercharge, Over Surge, Hyper Surge, Power Supply. I’m really thinking of Hypercharge now.

I did think of his real name when he’s not a superhero, it’s Ulrich Quintin De chavez Kidlatan.

I’m proud and I really like this character I made, I’m not really good at drawing right now but I know I’ll improve. Anyway, what ya’ll think?"

1qxxvlz,Is this wrong or am I over reacting?,Rant,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"For a little background information, me and my mother used to be very close, but the only reason we were close was because I was her manipulated pet. She manipulated me my whole childhood, which has messed me up big time. She had turned me against everyone in my life, to the point I thought my now best friend (sister) was gonna kill me. I have now realized that everything she's done was incredibly wrong to do to a child, so I have been trying to distance myself. I'm terrified of her touch and her in general.

Anyways, here's my big question. So I'm now 14, and my mother calls me upstairs to be with her changes into her pajama's. (This started when I was very young, I always felt a little un-comfy about it but now that I'm a teen I think it's really weird. As a younger child I thought she'd stop loving me if I didn't come, and now I know she'll be so mad if I don't come.) So I'm kinda stuck in this cycle, my heart pounds when I'm around her. Whenever I try to look away from her while she's unclothed she'll get angry and say ""You can't even look at me?""   ""You don't even love me anymore""  and stuff like that. So everyday I dread going upstairs but I can't stop because then she'll freak out and yell at me for not coming, and she'll make my life so much worse. 

Is this normal, am I just over reacting? I feel like it's kinda my fault."

​I’m currently 18 and I use a wheelchair. My parents are trying to have another child. By the time the baby is born, I’ll likely be 19 or 20.
​To be honest, I feel really weird and embarrassed about it. I’ve never met anyone who has a newborn baby brother or sister at age 18. The age gap feels massive, and I feel like it’s going to be awkward explaining this to people I feel like people will laugh at me or just living with it.

1qxdc8k,Joining a friend group,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"okay so last week I was eating lunch alone and this girl came up and asked if I wanted to join her friend group (like 8 people total). I said yes and it actually went pretty well? We talked, it was nice, I felt included. Though we branched out into like two different groups, like her and 2 other people and me.

But then the next day they didn't really talk to me when I saw them and my brain immediately went ""oh no they hate you, you did something wrong"" though my CS friend did say hi to me once while in the hallway with her friends and before hindi when I am them were standing there, they never approached me or talked to me.

Now it's Monday and I'm supposed to sit with them again but I'm lowkey terrified. Like:

* What if they think I'm weird for coming back?
* One girl doesn't really talk to me (but she did call me smart so idk?)
* I don't know some of the people and it makes me uncomfortable
* What if I'm forcing myself into a group that doesn't want me?

The confusing part is I DO have actual friends in the group - the girl who invited me has had lunch with me before and literally approached me when I was alone. My English friend is super nice to me. But I keep thinking the REST of them secretly dislike me.

Is this normal?? Am I overthinking this?? How do I just... go sit with them without my brain exploding???

1qxd2yw,Confused about mixed signals with a female close friend...need advice,Relationship,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I (19, M) have been talking to a girl from my college for almost two months. We used to talk daily and grew emotionally close. She opened up to me about feeling like an imposter at college, struggling during her initial days, crying after coming home, and feeling like everyone else had their life together. I related a lot to this as I was also feeling the same during my initial days of college.
Over time we developed a comfortable bond. I low-key flirted sometimes, and she didn’t shut it down. She also shared her shayari/poetry with me, which felt personal (or maybe I am very delusional)
A few days ago, I asked her what kind of guys she likes. She said someone who is smart, ambitious, motivating, and preferably tall. I didn’t react much, but internally it hit me because I don’t see myself as particularly smart or ambitious, I’m average height, and I don’t want someone to “compromise” or settle for me. I want to be accepted as i am.
The next day, She sent me  few romantic reels on which I left a like on Instagram asking me  jokingly with “acha, (my name) bhai.” I’m not sure if she meant it seriously or was just teasing, but it really confused me. 2 days later I deactivated my main account. When she asked why, I said I wanted to focus on my studies. We haven’t talked since then.
I was away from college for about a month and returned recently. When she saw me in class, she smiled, looked at me, and said “achha"" with her head tilted towards me as I sat behind her.Since then, I’ve noticed that she looks at me and smiles in class, but I don’t know if I’m overthinking or imagining things.
Now I’m stuck. Ignoring her is very difficult for me emotionally, but I also feel insecure because she’s extremely intelligent, hardworking, academically driven, and exceptionally beautiful. I feel like I’m nowhere near her level.
I don’t know whether I should:
Ignore her and try to move on( which is really difficult for me...my heart melts whenever she smiles at me)
Talk to her again normally
Or have an honest conversation about where we stand"

Anyways 3 of my friends had found out, and at first they were comforting me and trying their best to help but now there saying how i haven’t experienced anything traumatic enough to try taking my own life and how i didn’t really want to die because if if i did i would have done something more drastic like taking more pills or jumping off a building. And they keep talking about how i tell them practically everything and i normally communicate my emotions just fine so if i’ve been feeling drained for so long how come i didn’t speak up on it.

What i wanted to ask is does this make them bad friends because they’re making me feel like i'm lying and I’m constantly explaining myself but they just aren’t understanding and they claim my story dosent add up , someone please help me out!!"

If you're like me and like to waste a significant portion of your time staring at planes in admiration, you may have noticed some of these beautiful metal birds have wings that tend to point slightly upwards. This upward tilt is called a **Dihedral** and they do much more than just aesthetics.  


You see, when an airplane moves through the air at speed, air flows around the airplane in return, part of the airplane experiencing this effect is its wings. Long story short: They don't flap like a literal bird, rather they work because the air flowing under them moves slower (more pressure) than the air that flows on top of them (less pressure), this creates a suction effect that eventually lifts the plane into the sky, hence LIFT, it is important to note that this is generally an upward force that opposes gravity (atleast when the plane is flying upright). WEEEEEEE!!!!. This effect is amplified by the angle the wings meet the air, this angle is known as the ""Angle of Attack"" and will generally increase lift the larger it gets (up to a certain point, but that's a story for another day).

Now that we understand the core principle, we can get back to dihedrals. Picture an airplane flying straight through the calm air, the plane cruises steadily when all of a sudden the pilot rolls the plane 30 degrees to the left. Now, for those of us that paid attention in physics class, we know that the lift force is no longer being directed straight up but rather 30 degrees to the left, hence, a sideways vector has been added and as a result the plane begins to slip sideways resulting in what I'll call ""sideways air"" hitting the left wing from the side as we move left. Luckily for us though, our wing has a 35 degree dihedral, meaning that sideways air ""goes under"" our left wing and ever-so slightly increases our lift on that wing. The result? we begin to naturally roll back to our default level position, with no pilot input.

It is important to note that the right wing doesn't experience this because we aren't banked right and therefore are not moving to the right, this detail is important because it tells us that the right wing doesn't get any of that sweet succulent bonus airflow, this means the left wing produces slightly more lift than the right, hence the differential and the natural roll back to level flight.

Anyways, that's it for today's aerodynamic lesson. Was in a good mood and felt like sharing this in the simplest way I could. Thanks for reading."

1qwgyq0,Is it normal for friendships to feel awkward all of a sudden?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"My best friend and I used to be really close. A few weeks ago my routine changed, and now we only talk for about 10 minutes a day.

Because of this, things feel awkward and we sometimes don’t know what to say. I talked to her about it and she agreed it feels awkward sometimes too.

I’m pretty introverted and bad at starting conversations, and I don’t think there’s any drama — we’re just both busy.

Has anyone dealt with this? How do you keep a friendship from fading when you don’t talk much anymore?"

1qw9v7z,Anyone else disillusioned with the world?,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I don’t really have any ambitions or goals, everything I do (like driving lessons for example) is so I can fit better into society and be seen in a higher quality. I don’t have any care for driving, I just like when I do well and get told I do well.

However, education literally does not appeal to me. I finished school with mostly B’s, and some A’s. That’s fine, I’m not stupid. I haven’t completed college, I tried twice and stopped both times. It’s so much stress, I am so miserable and I can’t see why anyone would enjoy this, or do it miserably. 

You can’t guarantee me that if I go to college, and then university, and then whatever else, that I’ll be happy. So my present will be full of sleepless nights, juggling education, driving, a job and trying to maintain relationships, studying something that barely interests me, while being sad as shit. I overdosed like 3 times when I was in college. So it’s unhappiness, for a MAYBE happy life in the far far future. It’s just not appealing or exciting.

Most people my age have big dreams, know what they want, plan for the future. I don’t see a future where I’m happy at all. Am I the only one who feels this way? Had my first relationship, which just ended in more disappointment. I don’t think I can ever date again. Let alone balance friendships normally.

I don’t understand why I can’t just be normal? Why don’t I foam at the mouth at the idea of going to school and studying shit, why am I not excited for the future of paying bills, doing everything alone and being exploited by billionaires until I drop dead and never retire, like everyone else seems to be?"
1qw8caf,Im conflicted about my new friend.,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),im so conflicted with what to do with this girl in my school. On monday this new kid thats a grade below me started to talk to me in the bathroom and we became friends sumhow and i got her instagram. Yesterday on tuesday i sat with her at lunch and i thought it was a one time thing (she told me her table kicked her out because there wasnt space or something). My main lunch group hasnt been at school so ive been sitting with another group. So whenever she joined us we talked and shes like fairly normal looking like shes not a weird kid looking yk? but the more she talks the more i feel weirded out like were not compatible friends. Today after my class i walked out and it was lunch time and she immediately came up to me and expected to share a table. i didnt want to this time because she kept talking to me yesterday when i wanted to spend more time with my best friend. She followed anyways and expected to share a table but i didnt say anything because she didnt have anyone else to sit with. i didnt want to and my friend didnt want her to come either (she knows i get irritated). Another thing is shes very cringey and has my old humor from middle school so its an ick. Im just scared when my main lunch group comes back because none of my friends there have filters and they will be rude and ignore her or say something. i dont want tension but i dont want a girl thats a grade younger then me to follow me around like a puppy. i dont wanna blow her off tho

I didnt have a party of anything, i just got wished by my parents who think im a dissapointment cuz i never pass school and i got a gift from my sis who just gave it due to obligatory reasons. She gave me a phone case not like i wanted anything cuz all the money they spend on me is a waste. I am lwk a huge waste i feel like theres kids out there who would much rather want all the resources and oppurutnities given to me but instead of those who deserve it i get them. I got them, sm1 who is inherently just dumb and can never pass any class, sm1 who cant maintain any sorts of relationship with any people, sm1 who has no talent nothing special and is just a giant piece of shit. 

Idk why but before when i felt this way i used to always blame the system or my parents or society but since half a year or so the closer i got to 18 i just stopped blaming others and realised all the issues in my life are cuz of me and myself. I just wanna blame others so i can feel better about myself on being a failure. And now with my final year of highschool coming to a close and me still not passing any exams and not understanding any of the subjects i chose, I just lose all hope. I am not passing that final i am never graduating and im prolly gonna end up on the street in 5 years cuz i wont even get to work anywhere. 

And worse of all i feel hella guilty. My sister whose older is soo much more locked in, she made it to med school and is always making my parents proud and uses the resources and oppurtunities given to her. She is the ideal child and tho my parents pull the we love u equally bs ik for a fact they favour her more and tbh i aint even mad she deserves it. 

I wish i wasnt born into this world. I wish i had a choice cuz living is exhausting, i dont like doing any of this. And everyday i hear about stuff happening all over the world and it just makes me feel guilty and worse that why am i living such a safe and comfy life. I have soo much privlege and yet i feel this way and complain and i hate it. And the older i get i just lose hope in myself. I cant do anything, I cant pass any exams, i dont have some talent, i have nothing. And no matter how hard i try and keep trying and put all my effort into things. I never get the results. 

Its like pouring water into a bottle with a hole, i feel like im doing smthing but nothing is happening all the water is just being wasted. I just wish i didnt exist all of this is so exhausting and even tho people say to me i understand u and bs i just dont care. I just wish i wasnt born i hate all of this. "

1quypyc,My mom wants to keep me underweight,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"(I use Google translator)

I've been slightly underweight for a year now. It's nothing serious, but I'm not happy with it. My BMI is 18. I told my mom about this, just wanted to share.

Mom: So how much would you like to gain?
Me: I think about 3 kg, it's kind of the minimum norm for me (49kg)
Mom: 3 kg??? If you gain that much, you'll look like a fat ball. You are short. 
Then she saw a bun on my table.
Mom: And you don't need to devour buns all day long, it's bad for your health. 

That day (and it was already evening) I ate one bowl of soup and that was it, I was so hungry to eat something else and she said such a thing.
She herself is very unhappy with her figure and I have a feeling that she envies me and doesn’t realize it. There used to be some weird ""jokes"" about me being a fat mare. I told her to stop several times, and she doesn't say it anymore. 

Now I feel like I look really wide and fat. I feel like the scale is lying and I weigh 55 kg instead of 46 kg. My disgustingly broad, mannish, ugly shoulders make me look like a swimmer. Maybe my mom is right and I should give up on trying to gain weight to my normal level?"

1quk8of,Anxiety is eating me alive while my parents don't care!,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I have been living with intense fear and stress for over 5 years. Recently, the overall anxiety has gotten better, but the spikes have gotten so much worse. Last night I was shaking and couldn't sleep, spiraling over a thought about something I know, logically, will never happen. I can't stop feeling awful and I need advice.

\*\*Background\*\*

My home life was rough. My dad is a narcissist, my mom is a pathological liar. Between ages 10-13 there was a lot of emotional abuse. My dad refused to acknowledge me. My mom lied, manipulated, minimized. I begged her for validation and got nothing. I lost friends, couldn't function socially, had panic attacks multiple times a day with intense flashbacks.

I tried therapy as a teen but my parents would come into sessions, rewrite history, and negotiate my words and feelings with the therapist. At one family event, my nervousness and awkwardness was misread by everyone — relatives, my parents, all of them. I overheard them talking about me. After that I didn't trust myself to be around people at all. I hid for months.

Eventually I started doing a lot of journaling and self-reflection to work through everything, since I didn't really have anyone safe to talk to. Over time it actually helped. I was able to forgive my parents, reach a more stable emotional baseline, and slowly start being able to socialize again.

\*\*What's happening now\*\*

The past has healed, mostly. But the future terrifies me. I get extremely intense intrusive thoughts that feel like they're happening in real time, even though I know they're not. They center around social situations — specifically family settings where my brain shows me a version of myself saying horrific, cringe, completely out-of-character things that would make everyone around me deeply uncomfortable.

I want to be clear: I have never said or done anything like what these thoughts show me. I have zero desire to. I know it's not who I am. But the thoughts feel so real and so vivid that they physically destroy me. I shake, I sweat, my chest feels like it's collapsing. It's like watching a version of myself I desperately hate and it's folding me inward.

There's a family event coming up. I don't have to go. It's almost certain nothing bad would happen. But my brain won't stop showing me these worst-case scenarios and I can't make it stop.

\*\*The frustrating part\*\*

I know, logically, that I'm fine. I've been to appointments, social outings, interactions with strangers recently and I've been completely normal. There's no reason to believe I would suddenly lose all self-control in a family setting. But knowing that does almost nothing to stop the thoughts.

\*\*What I've tried\*\*

Grounding exercises (5-4-3-2-1), physical activity, naming feelings, journaling my thoughts. They help for a few minutes and then the thought comes back harder.

\*\*What I actually need help with\*\*

How do you deal with intrusive thoughts that feel completely uncontrollable? I know I have control over my body and my actions. I know these thoughts don't reflect who I am. But I still can't shake the terror that one day I'll become that version of myself. How do I make these thoughts stop eating me alive?

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* I've been dealing with severe anxiety since childhood. I now get intense intrusive thoughts about saying horrific things in social situations, things I would never actually say or do. I know they're not real but they're physically destroying me. Grounding and journaling only work for minutes. How do other people deal with this?"

another thing i want to know if like normal high school guys like it better for a girl to be like “loud” (idk how to put it into words but not like “pick me” level but js like be their true authentic self like laughing and actually putting in effort for the guy) or do you actually like us playing hard to get for a little bit. personally i feel like it’s nice for a day or two to feel like im being chased but then i js wanna be like a real person, i had a bf last year that i was js like texting pretty dryly ngl like we would hardly ever send big paragraphs and only call for like half an hour every day. but this year i wanted to try smth else and this guy got my number so i js started doing the complete opposite like overhearing EVERYTHINGGG js to see if there was a difference. but also why tf are talking stages so long when dating was basically the same as talking for like half the ppl i’ve dated."

I feel like my childhood was so fucked up but I'm still dealing with it now. All the crazy shit from when I was little is re-surfacing and now I'm realizing it was blatant emotional neglect. I'm the eldest daughter too. I'm treated worse than my younger brother. Treated even worse when I was his age. I have to clean up after everyone because they ""don't have time."" I've been told that my job is keeping the house clean, not school, nothing else. School's a privilege. I'm bi. My mother's a MAGA supporter even though she sees what's happening now. My dad should be my source of comfort but he likes to keep the family waling around glass too. He recently grabbed me by my collar and threw me on the ground because I didn't do the dishes when he wanted me to. They moved me 1200 miles away from everyone I knew and loved to some isolated mountain town where I get bullied because they couldn't wait until my graduation. And not for financial reasons, but because they were just tired of ""the lack of scenery"". I've been told so many times that I'm demon-possessed, selfish, and I need to shut up and listen to people that are better than me. I'm not good enough for anything, and the amount of times that's been reinforced by not only my family, but by my new peers at school and by society just makes me want to kms. I told my mother that I was suicidal and she made me eat soap because ""I didn't mean it"" and it hurt her feelings. I got therapy for awhile but my mom didn't like the therapist because it made me realize this shit. So she pulled me out and put me on antidepressants. Every time I get emotional it's summed down to ""did you take your meds?"" or ""It's just your hormones"" I didn't even know how much this shit was messing with me until just now, talking to kids with normal parents and wondering why mine aren't ""as lenient"" or whatever. Every time I'm away from home I feel so much better. 

I hope I can leave as soon as I graduate. Or maybe I am a little spoiled idk."

I don’t like this friend back, I find him rather rude and inconsiderate sometimes tbh, plus I like girls more and I’m not looking to really date rn. I don’t want to reject him though because he’s the son of my teacher and band director, so that’d be weird. This has happened to my friend group before and now we no longer talk to one of the two people involved. This same friend has also tried confessing to my best friend before which started a whole thing. I just don’t know what to do and really don’t want my friend group to fall apart again.

1qu6iss,Fake Positivity and Mean Girlism,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I'm probably being cynical because they arent all Regina George coded, but it's definitely something close.

I hate when I watch a beauty or aesthetic video and the comments are full of ""teen girls, know youre loved,"" or ""your body is beautiful as it is,"" OR ""be yourself"" or ""i feel bad people actually watch videos like this,"" or ""I feel bad teenage girls think they have to look like this."" It's just so icky. Isnt it just projecting their own grievances on beauty, and their own misgivings on body, like issues when THEY were a teenager and now forcing hypervigilance on kids? 

As a hypochondriac, I know a bit too much about health and the body. More so than the average teenager, often also the average adult: so it annoys me when I see comments like those pretending like the advice in the video is unhealthy or even traumatizing 💀. Even when its ""eat protein, go on a calorie-deficit, go for runs"" the video; and even if information could be added, to act like its advocating for anorexia or actung as  ""thin-spo"" is so cringe and virtue signaling in the way they write comments clearly not actually understanding health, and definitely not even watching the video. Very clearly having gone straight to the comments presumptively.

Maybe I'm having my own Regina moment, but I feel like women who've seen it all (the anorexic and bulimic advice, the obsession with aesthetics that lead to comparison and self-loathing) and have actually cultivated themselves in terms of health or improving bodily aesthetics healthily would give normal advice and explain the science without discouraging girls from caring about it. It's giving people who already struggle with their appearance seeing a video about getting let's say a flat stomach, or even glass-skin skincare videos, or glass-hair haircare videos, and deciding its toxic and wanting to get girls to not want to care about their looks at all...which is weird. Isnt it normal to have aesthetic ideals? I dont trust older women, as a girl, who give empty advice and dont see to be helping and site science I already have research in my back-pocket to disprove. It doesnt give older-sister wisdom at all when I see the type of fake positivity advice on beauty content. 

  
Practical, real-world advocacy from experience for not obsessing over aesthetics and how to actually apply your ideals to what is possible is more older-sister wisdom and doesnt seem fake at all. "
1qu10fo,Will she come back or did she lie? (Relationship Advice),Advice,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Hello, im 18M and my girlfriend is 17F. I am a freshman(ish, transfered in with 24 credits)in college, and she is a senior in High school, she is also going to graduate with her associates as well. We both share the same life goals, which is we both want to become lawyers. Yes this already makes it challenging, but we always told each other we will talk all problems out and try to figure sruff out for each other. 

Unfortunately, 2 weeks ago today, we broke up. We talked about this in person, and she said she wanted to break up to work on herself. She said she wants to get back together soon, in a few months or so, but i have a feeling she said that just to dangle a carrot in front of my face. She stated that she will not be getting with any other guys, because she doesn't want to, and I believe her because she has not had a history of doing stuff like that. I tried to see if we can find some sort of compromise, such as distancing ourselves from each other but stay dating. But she was committed to breaking up. I have a feeling she wont want to get back with me. 

She said we can still talk, but not as much, so I made the initiative to only talk to her once a day, like a message or so. She seems to have done the same. We go around 1 day between messages. Im a little nervous, and a little sad, but not as much as one normally would be after a break up. I get giving her space and im certainly not going to push it any more.

  
Any advice?"
1qu0oec,Everything is going downhill,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"(english is not my native language,so following sentences may be grammatically incorrect)
My life isn't the same since I turned 11.This was the time my little brother was born,and from this moment on, everything is getting out of hand.Firstly,the amount of work I did at home suddenly ramped up–from just helipng with garden to planting it and taking full care of it(it is a pretty big garden with lots of work to do)or to haul coal from place to place, because we live in very rural area,yet the most infuriating thing was to babysit my brother.It started normally as just watching over him,but now I can spend whole day with him(not even joking),and I don't even receive thanks.But this is not the main reason I write this,there is few things with my mental health that started to concern me recently:

 1. Fear.I started to fear everything,like really everything.I get to sleep very lately because of some thoughts that I can't describe but they fear me.Every evening has the same cycle:Fear of tomorrow→fear caused by thoughts→fear of myself→just clear fear without any reason

2. Emotions.I can't control myself anymore, I cry almost every day,also without reason.One day I spent over 2 and half hours crying because my father yelled at me(I know this is not so good reason to cry)

3. Social status.I may be very communicative and maybe respectable person in almost every local community,but I feel like an outsider.Like everything people say about me is lie or just a flattery,so I can't really feel like truly important person

4. Parents .It Is hardest and most complex thing by far . I love my parents from bottom of my heart,but I really can't tell whether they feel the same or not.They yell,scream,argue with me and eachother,also they used to use physical detentions(they were beating weakly,but it's still kind of sad).Also my dad says that my opinion is not something he's concerned about.Usually,at home I feel either like a ghost or like a punching bag.I was telling them about some of my major problems,but they are not concerned by it,in fact,they started to give me even more work because 'I became lazy'.They also never told a good word to me unless I did something very valuable(I can't even say that they are proud of me,even though I have a 'Pride of the country' medal,that is hard to get)

 I have almost no one to tell about it,so this post is kind of my last resort.I write this not because I need support,but because I want to know that someone hears me and knows that I'm not so happy."

1qtr328,"I Found out My Best friend is datin g My Sister, I'm completely broken",Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I never thought I’d be in this position, but here we are.Yesterday was one of the hardest days I’ve had in a long time. My parents were out of town when my sister told me she and my best friend wanted to talk. The moment I saw them sitting together, holding hands, my gut already knew something was wrong. They told me they’ve been dating for two months, and “seeing each other” for about six. My best friend someone I’ve known since we were kids, someone I trusted like a brother said he loves her, respects her, and sees a future with her. He apologized for hiding it.

I barely remember what he said after that. I felt shocked, angry, hurt… and honestly, betrayed.
Not because they’re dating. They’re both adults  that’s not the issue. The issue is the lying. Two months of lying straight to my face. Every hangout, every joke, every normal day, knowing this was happening behind my back. What hurt even more was finding out that my other sister knew from the beginning, and so did some of my friends. I felt stupid asking where they were, while they were out on dates and everyone else was covering for them. Being called “bro” by my best friend while he was hiding all of this just added salt to the wound.
It made me question how much I actually mattered to them. I always valued honesty and loyalty, and realizing they didn’t trust me enough to tell me early on really messed with my head. It wasn’t what they did  it was how they did it.

I told them I won’t stop them. They can date, they can tell our parents. My sister comes first always. But things between my best friend and me will never be the same. The dynamic is permanently changed. I didn’t just lose a friend; I lost the version of my sister who used to come to me without filters.What scares me most is the future. If things go wrong and let’s be real, relationships that start this young don’t always last I’ll be the one stuck in the middle. Forced to pick sides. Losing either my best friend or my sister, maybe both. That’s a risk they chose, knowing exactly how it would affect me. And that hurts more than anything else.

People say “you don’t need permission to date,” and they’re right. I’m not owed control over anyone’s life. But trust and consideration matter in close relationships, and that’s where I feel discarded. Out of all the people in the world, why did it have to be my sister? There are lines you don’t cross when friendship means something.Now I’m the third wheel. When he comes over, it’s not for me anymore. I can’t talk to him the way I used to. I can’t pretend nothing changed. I understand now that I was naive to think I held the same importance in their lives as they did in mine.

So I’m pulling back. Not out of revenge, not out of hatred but self-respect. They don’t need my permission, and I don’t need to stay emotionally involved in something that hurts me. I hope they’re happy. I truly do. But I lost two of the closest people in my life in one day, and that pain is real."

If I do small talk, it gets awkward when I make it more than what it is. And if I tell them I have ADHD after doing something wrong, they say I'm using it as an excuse. It's been a while since I've been acknowledging I am this way, and there's always been difficulty with people trying to understand, and I'm starting to give up.

1qtl2js,Should I still give my ex-bestfriend her birthday present even after we just ended our friendship?,Advice,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"I feel horrible having to post this publicly but I genuinely need advice.

To sum it up (kind of)

About two days ago my friend (17 F) and I got into OUR FIRST argument. It started off with her finally voicing her feelings about my other friend (18 M) and I’s jokes. Jokes such as “omg you’re so fake,”

“you love your boyfriend more than us &gt;.&lt;“ or “No boyfriends allowed” since we prefer to hang out with her alone. We would say this in unserious situations and we never thought she took them seriously because some of the jokes we make to each other have been normal to us, or at least that’s what me and my friend (18 M) thought. And obviously our first instinct is to apologize and promise to never make jokes like that again. But she continued to berate us, which is understandable since she was upset and had been keeping this anger within for a while and the whole reason why she’s addressing this is to fix issues in our friendship, but she started bringing up unrelated and unnecessary situations of the past to compare, which really didn’t sit well with us, and obviously we explained why it wasn’t a good choice to use the past as comparisons as it was different. Basically we were trying to clear up misunderstandings and she saw this as an attack to her.

The whole time, in between us explaining to her how the circumstances were different, and we would’ve appreciated if she was more vocal about her feelings since we’ve been friends for 6 years, we were apologizing and putting our pride aside for the sake of our friendship, yet she claimed that we were trying to make ourselves look better or feel better about ourselves.. She was dodging my apologies and continued to make more arguments when we’ve already apologized and promised to never do it again. (There were things I admit I could’ve phrased better but I was frustrated due to her misunderstanding what we’re trying to tell her, but everything I said came from the heart, I meant well.)

She also said pretty hurtful things about our friendship, and we tried to push that aside, but we still can’t shrug off ‘til now. I think there was just a huge misunderstanding of us not fully understanding each other, but we tried so hard. To us, it seemed like she just wanted to argue rather than to resolve, and that’s what she also thought about us (Me and 18 M). I decided to leave one long final paragraph reasoning, speaking about my feelings, admitting my wrongs, and apologizing, promising to never repeat them again, while also stating that I’m not gonna be fighting for our friendship if she didn’t want it (since she admitted she was unhappy with hanging out with us) 

She completely ignored my apology AGAIN and argued again, basically finding fault with the long message I sent. I gave up. She started being sarcastic, when we were trying to fix things and I ended up breaking our friendship. (argument lasted from 7 pm to 1 am)

We had to attend a party the next day, I got drunk and told her I never wanted to end our friendship and apologized. I don’t think she cared, body language and the way she acted the whole party. And now tomorrow is her birthday and I’m not sure If I should give her gift because I still care for her and it’s her big day. However, people are telling me to not give the gift so I don’t know what to do. I don’t want her to think I don’t care, but at the same time I also think if she doesn’t want to talk then I respect that.

What should I do?"

Anyways. I'm just going deeper down my own rabbit hole of shitty mental health

I keep having a recurring dream where km in an abandoned city and apparently it's meant to be smth about comfort. That's a story for another post (js karma farming atp)


My insecurity is 10 times worse for my weight a I'm soon starting college (I moved up a year u start sooner then others my age) and I'm scared my bullying will continue there because it's happened my whole life and never stopped or anything and the fear has got me hostage like a terrorist attack. I keep resorting to humor and biting myself really hard and the back of my roght hand. Is that self harm (can someone tell me if it is?) Anyways I have big exams soon which are basically my 2nd biggest ones and the pressure is just so much. I've been pushed for top grades as I USED to be a child genius and now it's just fucking splattered against the wall like a paintball.

The mixed signals from that girl I'm talking to. I can't rmemebe whether I talked abt her last time. But I live her sm she's so kind and like so energetic which is the opposite of me she's like sk amazing but she's js like so confusing for the signals and it's got me so stressed. Because I dknt want ti make a fool if myself by either asking her out normally or even worse doing jt on valentines day which would be devastating if she said no💔 but like yeah

I recently found out that my hb was abusing his girlfriend severly so that took a toll in me for not noticing and shit and I feel so bad for her coz she's such a noce girl and her life is full of shit stuff and allat.

I've lost a slight bit of weight like 2 kg I think, I'm eating less but not starving myself but I want to lose weight so girls find me attractive because all I want is for someone to love me like I would love them and I feel like I'm just too unattractive for love. I'm not like hideous or anything km like average to below average depending on how you look at it but.

My maturation addiction is worse. I'm doing it a lot more. It probs doesn't help that it stops my stress a bit so that's annoying

I'm over my ex and shit😛😛😛

The infection I had in November that lut me jn the hospital came back sk that a bummer and it hurt a lot more this time sadly but I had a panic when the doctors tried to lut the needle in my arm for my bloods when is pretty poopoo icl

Whenever I listen to music all my sad memories nad thoughts always comeback but it's comforting at the same time and I js start crying

All u want is to just hug someone I can trust and cry on their shoulder. It's all I've wanted for about a year now scrap that since year 7 (since I was 10) (I moved up a year) ( I should've been 11). And I'll use ever been given was horrid rejections *a girl left the school coz I asked her out* and another time a girl threw up when im not even that unattractive I just dont see why people can't like me or love me.

1qtdhlk,Second serious breakup and I just need people to hear this,Serious,Peer Normalization,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I'm 15 years old, Im just gonna start from the begging.
My first serious breakup was with a girl that I was with for 8 months, we got together at this one teen disco party and just started dating, it went rlly well for like the first 6 or so months and she slowly started not paying as much attention to me and just like didn't see me that much, stopped kissing me and like any physical touch at all, it hurt me inside and it was the day after Halloween that I sent her a long paragraph asking if everything was fine or if she needed help or anyone to talk to, or even if I was doing anything wrong at all because I try to be the best I can for my partner, if I do something uncomfortable or anything that gives you the ick, I'll change my ways.
She replied with another paragraph saying that she's been loosing feelings for me over the span of a good while and that it's not my fault but she just can't do it anymore. This one broke me for a while and this is where the next girl comes into play.
After the breakup there was quite a lot of people who tried to help me through it, there was 2 girls that were friends and from what I could tell, one of them liked me (a lot) and the other helped me through everything and literally held me as I cried about my ex. I liked both of them a lot and I'm gonna have to say but this was one of the hardest decisions of my life, I had to pick between them because from what I could see, they both liked me- even one of Thier sisters said that we would make a good couple.

But I eventually asked out the one that was there for me and I literally broke the other ones heart, she was crying when she found out that I got with the other girl and I felt so bad. But i was with this girl for about 2 months and I fell HARD, we just clicked and everything was so much better than the last relationship, we had the same love language and we got eachother gifts and everything. It was amazing but just yesterday, she was acting a bit weird- we normally call a LOT (she likes to call) I'm talking like 2-5 hours a day and that was a bit of a struggle but yesterday we were on call for like an hour and we were both exhausted. We didn't talk that much and just did our own things. Up to this point it was all going amazing but then ""we need to talk"" I get that text when I'm just playing Roblox and my heart sinks.

I asked her ""what is it? Is everything ok, do you need to talk?"" She read the message and didn't reply for 15 minutes and I was dying. She eventually sent me the message and it tore me up, she said that she couldn't keep going and that it would just hurt the both of us in the long run and that she just couldn't do this anymore 

""I love you as a person but I just can't keep pushing myself in a relationship that I tried to want"" 

After looking back now, it seems that I rushed in too much, the breakup mixed with the stress of these two girls and my friends saying ""RIZZ"" and ""she likes you bro"" just pushed forwards too fast, we didn't even have a talking stage and I just kinda rushed in. If I look at it from her perspective it's fucked up, you help a guy through a breakup- he asks you out snd you feel like you have to say yes because itl just break him even more and the guilt builds up and eventually you just can't do it anymore.

I ended up crying for about an hour yesterday, truly hearty crying and I just decided that I was going to take a break from dating- it's nice, not nice- amazing for a while but then something happens and it all goes into a pit.

I don't know why I made this post but I just wanted to say to you guys, don't rush into love- take your time to find the one that truly matches you. Look at it from Thier angle too, that helps a lot. 

Thank you for reading this and taking time off your day. I hope that this effects you in some kind of way or you learn something about teen love or emotions in general. The world is a beautiful yet messed up place."

I‘ve started learning to do makeup and I hardly eat anymore because I wonder if being skinnier and prettier would make people like me more. I wish more boys liked me, and I try to dance on the line of reasonably hot/sl\*tty so that I’ll get noticed. I really just want to have people stop forgetting about me. Is this normal? Please, if you have any advice, I’d love to hear it. Thanks."

1qt8nz3,Is it normal to feel this way?,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"whenever i see a pretty girl i acknowledge that they’re pretty but the attraction i feel is more like “i wish i could look like her” and things like that instead of wanting to date that girl. 

i’m a little confused because I asked some of my friends and they said that they don’t feel like this but I’ve felt like this since i was young, I’m biologically male as well so i’m not sure why it’s different for me. Do you guys experience the same thing? "
1qt3d5e,Changing schools soon,School,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"My parents recently told me I’ll have to change schools because we’re moving out of town. Normally I wouldn’t care that much, but I’ve never really been accepted by people, aside from a few friends I had to work really hard for.

I know I’m kind of “weird” compared to most teens. I’m into chess, LEGO collecting, I don't know how to socialise (because people never really accepted me), and playing old or obscure video games (mostly pre-2015). I also don’t like a lot of typical teen stuff — I hate physical sports, shooters, art and etc.

So I guess my question is: how do teens usually react to a new classmate who’s different? I’m not trying to be dramatic, but I’ve been bullied or excluded most of my life for not fitting in, and changing schools at 16 honestly scares me.

Sorry if this is a dumb question. I just want to know what to expect."

1qt03bz,"""Bare minimum"" culture sickens me",Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Imagine, you drive your girlfriend around, you pay for the both of you at bars and restaurants, you buy her gifts when you feel like it, and you do all of this stuff because you want to and because you feel like being nice to her, but she never thanks you. Then, when you actually confront her about it she says ""Well, it's the bare minimum""

Excuse me? Nobody told me that being ungrateful is normal now, what she calls ""bare minimum"" I call ""nice and thoughtful things"" which are to be appreciated regardless. Like, if someone's lucky enough to still have a mother, when she cooks two meals a day every day until you move out for college, do you thank her or do you stay silent because ""it's the bare minimum from a mother""? Like, what sickening philosophy is that?"

I mean, I’m supposed to have an awesome day tmr, go bowling with some friends then get my gifts from my dad. But. I’m just not excited. Or happy. I’m just sad. This is bullshit. Birthdays are such bs. Why are they so depressing. It doesn’t make sense, as a kid they were all joy and laughter, but now, It’s the complete opposite! I mean, it hasn’t even been that long, it’s been like what, 2-3 years ive felt so depressed at my birthday? Actually no. I’ve always felt like shit at my birthday. ANYWAYS.

1qsn6sk,Feeling a bit conflicted now,Rant,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"DAMN, all I post on here is rants. Anyways. I've been wanting to become a scientist for, like, half my life. Studied biology, trying to study chemistry and much more. However. I'm losing interest. I don't want to be here anymore- Yeah, in both ways, yikes. But mainly ""I don't want to be here"" in a mental sense, like, don't want to be stuck here with this mentality. Anyways. I'm losing interest because nothing is interesting. I can spend hours learning things about fictional science/lore/anything because it's entertaining, but it won't get me anywhere in life. SCP Foundation? I have two notebooks full of information on it. Entities in an RPG? I have spent hours analyzing every single thing about them, and how I could easily get past them/interact with them correctly. Psychological horror games/horror games? I like to know every little thing about the characters, bad ones, good ones. All because I want to rant to myself about why I think they do things, and how they would be under different hypotheticals. I think I do this to make myself feel smarter. I love information, just not real life information. That's kinda why I like the paranormal, and like to acknowledge religion, because it's the closest damn thing I have to something really interesting. I'm a little disappointed in myself for giving up, and I keep telling myself that it's okay because ""I probably wouldn't have made it anyway"" and ""I can always find a hobby to make life interesting"". ""I don't have to be smart"". I can't be upset at myself for some things. I gave up on studying biology because it literally gives me panic attacks now, for whatever reason. Plus, I used to neglect my health just to study. I'm learning languages and putting chemistry on hold because its less stress on my brain. I don't know how much longer I can wait for medication, because I'm very convinced this is ADHD and anxiety causing it but I mean, I will be so behind even if I do end up pursuing science or something similar. Life is just so boring, that studying it seems pointless. Everyone already knows that, so it makes it seem less special. I get nothing out of it but hours wasted. But I miss when I did have motivation, sitting up at night on my 3rd cup of coffee, hand bruised from holding the pencil. I'm not burned out, I still have motivation, I just dont have interest. If that makes sense. I think I'm actually breaking my mind down, and I can't stop it. I mean, I feel like I've been close to a breaking point multiple times, and my past posts will show that. Im struggling because of me, and I know why but I don't know how to stop it. Which is embarrassing, because nowadays that's just called being in a bad place mentally. Off topic, but I legit have felt like 'Jim' from Jim's computer (unfortunately, the damn ROBLOX game) for years. That sounds cringe. But I wake up in the middle of the night, often to check my house because of paranoia, hallucinate, and have considered suic1de because I was so panicked from the paranoia. But when I told the social worker, she didn't care so I guess I'm completely fine mentally huh. Fuck, this is long. Sorry I think. Everything Is just getting so much worse, to where I'm actually sure I would gross someone out with even a small thing. At this point it's not a spiral, it's a loop. But it's getting shorter, meaning my time of happiness is getting shorter and the suffering is becoming more than half of it. Why is nobody helping me? Professionals, I mean. Is this not concerning?? Am I being dramatic? I just want to feel fucking normal for once in my life. This is getting out of hand, I need calm down. If you read this much, why?? I'm boring. But thanks for your time? "
1qsme1g,Does somebody know what this is?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Today I had a weird feeling while I was in Mass. My stomach started to hurt a lot, and I started to feel a little dizzy; my vision blurred a little bit. Then I started to progressively hear less around me, like I was far away. I know it wasn't falling asleep, like I sometimes do; it was more like a feeling of wanting to puke or pass out, but at the same time, different. This lasted for about 1-5 minutes, but I don't know. Then it started to progressively go back to normal, but I noticed a faint ringing in my ears, although I could hear now, I was covered in a thin layer of sweat, and my legs were shaking a little. 

I have never felt this before, and I wish it stays that way because it was not a good experience, especially in the middle of Mass where I had to stay standing and put on a neutral face. So if somebody knows what tf was, please share thoughts."
1qsdykt,Why is it so normalised,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),I’m (14f) and like basically all my friends have had sex by now and I find that so crazy. Like am I ment to do it too. It’s like I’m the weird one for not doing it but we’re only 14 like why is this so normalised and they think I’m joking when I say this but there is literally no reason for it a this age. I know we’re at an age where we’re exploring things and stuff but is sex really needed right now out of everything we’re doing. And I know it’s not my life and I shouldn’t be so annoyed about it since it’s not affecting me but it is effecting me in more ways than one. I’m actually starting to think that maybe I’m not normal because everyone around me seems to not see the problem. I can’t even have a normal conversation with a boy without them bringing it up . And the thing is it probably doesn’t feel that good like I know that shit hurts so why would I even do it. It’s like it’s become a literal trend I can’t even have a normal conversation with my friends without out them talking about their experiences . It’s not even like I think sex is disgusting but why can’t you just wait till you’re older why is it so normal to do something like that. I have never show disgust towards my friend for doing it because I’m not like that but I just always try tell them why I would never do it they think I’m being closed minded or trying to act as if I’m above them and I am soo sick and tired of it.
1qs9gy7,The best day of my life,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"TL;DR: Didn't go to school at all, didn't take three tests I did not study for, watched a presentation that reinspired me to follow my passion, talked to a girl and got her number, center of attention by my classmates, was not forced to quit the team, ate a lot of good food.

Friday January 30th, 2026 is officially the best day of my life. 

My video production class had a ""field trip."" The reason I put it in quotes is because we were in the auditorium of my school the entire day. Because of this field trip I didn't have to take three tests I was supposed to take.

The field trip was a guest speaker came to our school to talk about other student films and critique them. It was very informative and it really inspired me to make more movies. 

Along with our film class another film class from another school came to our school to watch the same guest speaker as us. 

Now after about 4 hours of this guy talking we had a 1 1/2 hour lunch break. During this break I mostly talked to the guy next to me about the things he talked about and other stuff. 

While we were talking two girls in front of us turned around and started talking to us about movies or something. A bit later the girl that was sitting right in front of me turned around to talk. After a while another classmate pulled out a gimbil and those two girls and the guy I was talking too left. 

Now it was just me and the girl in front of me. Let's call her Ruby. Ruby stayed behind and now we were talking. We have so many similar interests and talked for almost 40 minutes straight. 

After the assembly I asked for her number and she said sure. We exchange numbers and she leaves. 

Turns out, during that whole 40 minutes, all of my classmates were watching me do a LeBron James on the moon. And they all wanted to hear how it went and what I said and what happened. I really liked the attention.

The school day wasn't over yet though so we headed back to the video room where the other school had stayed waiting for our bus. I immediately look for Ruby and we talk more. 

The bottom half of Ruby's face is really red so I ask if she's okay and she says she just gets red easily. I also ask her why she's smiling so much and she says she's just nervous. Idk if that's a good thing but that's out there now. 

Ruby then leaves and again, all of my classmates were watching and now wanting to know what we talked about and were hyping me up. I got about half of the class surrounding me asking for details. It was awesome. 

A girl even said that this is the most interesting thing to ever happen in this classroom. 

All of them kept teasing me about it, some guy asked me when we're gonna get married. Another classmate took a picture of me talking to her and it was rlly cute. Every time I took out my phone they asked if she texted me yet. 

I'm glad this is the new ""thing."" Everyone used to make fun of my forehead but now it's just me and Ruby and they're teasing me for that. It's 100 times better than before and I like it when they ""make fun of me"" for that. 

Going off of that plot for a second. My brother is forcing me to quit my sports team because I'm getting bad grades and told me to quit today. But if I'm gonna quit, I don't want to today because today was the end of the normal season before playoffs and we always have a celebration with food and stuff. 

During my field trip he texts me telling me to not go to practice and to quit. So I'm trying to come up with an excuse but then 2 hours later he just randomly says not to and to quit in Monday. So another great thing.

Had the best time eating a whole bunch of foodand talking, my two favorite activities.

We texted after that pretty much the rest of the day where I found out we have many more similar interests. she had to eat dinner and left. I double texted which I know is bad but I haven't seen what she's replied yet because I just woke up and realized I should journal this on reddit. 

Last note, I'm like kinda overthinking it now like I always do. I mean, she said she was shy in general and only has one friend group. So I don't really know if she gave me her number because she just didn't want to say no. 

Idk I think I'm overthinking it.

From now on I will always say, ""this is the second best day of my life"" when something good happens to me. "

1qrmyis,My school had shooting threats this week 🙁,Serious,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"So yesterday we had a lockdown across all three of our school campuses because of a shooting threat made. I guess someone called the suicide hotline and told them that they were going to kill themselves and others, and if reinforcements tried to stop them, they’d kill police officers too. FYI, I’m only 14 and not in high school yet. I have a special elective at our middle school campus, so I have to walk over there at the end of the day.

The walk is about five minutes and is across a giant field that connects to the junior high and middle school. Everyone else had already gotten to our class except me and five other girls. When I was almost there, a teacher came out and was screaming for us to get inside. After I ran, the other girls followed. The teacher took us to the library and locked us inside.

The librarian was really stressed out and had us turn off the library’s lights and close its blinds. She then locked me, the other girls, and herself in this closet behind her desk. It was a decent-sized closet. We were all able to sit down and have wiggle room. Some girls left their backpacks outside of the closet with their phones in them, so the librarian left to go get all of our bags, and when she came back, everyone started texting their parents or siblings.

The librarian was crying because her daughter was at the high school, and we were all stressed trying to figure out what happened because at the time we didn’t know it was a shooting threat. After about 45 minutes someone came in and unlocked the door and scared us really bad, but it was just the janitor looking for us. After all that, we went back to class as normal. Today barely anyone came back.

Almost everyone is terrified. Today there was supposed to be a walkout and protests at the high school, and I knew like twenty people that were going. But at lunch today our police department posted something that said that the protest was a setup and somebody called in a threat to shoot up the protest and called in another threat for the schools. A bunch of my friends were leaving and going home.

I didn’t know anything about the shooting threat against the protest until my friend texted me. My friend and our other friend went home together because they were scared. My friend was texting me a bunch, telling me “to go home” and “I needed to get out of there while I still can.” I then found out that, like, ten of my other friends had their parents come pick them up, and two girls in my class at the time were also trying to leave. We were all so scared.

I felt like I was going to throw up; the girl next to me was crying because her brother goes to our high school, and another girl was about to have a panic attack because her parents thought she was lying. My dad came and picked me up at the end of the period. I got home and looked on Facebook and saw all the campuses had gone into another lockdown, but nothing happened. I’m scared to go back to school on Monday, and I really hope nothing happens. No one deserves this."
1qrplh2,Are gun threats normal?,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So at my school today there was a threat that another student was gonna bring a weapon to school (i'm 14 in 8th grade) and i was wondering if this is a common thing in other states.

  
It happens every other month or so and i'm just curious as to if this is normal. It makes sense that with social media and stuff that it would get around more, but it seems like it is a huge problem. 

  
I live in SCOTTSDALE AZ. Probably the LEAST ghetto city on the east coast, so i genuinely wonder how it is in other places. The kid was arrested in the middle of the night (allegedly) so we were all safe, but like jeez dude, why would you just ruin your life like that, especially when you are so set up for success? (also im like 90% sure the kid was faking, but if he wasn't thats awful and he needs help).

  
Anyway bye! thanks for reading lol have a great day :D"
1qrm52q,Why are we normalizing this?,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I'm putting this as 18+ because there will be details about vi0lence and dr/ugs. And maybe a little bit of inappropriate words.

There's a boy I love like a little brother. He's been going through some stuff. At school, at home. And I don't have enough power to do anything about it.

I've known him since he was around 7. Been almost ten years now, maybe. 
He was a nice kid then. Fucking hilarious. Listens. Full of talents. An amazing kid.

Growing up, his mom had been distant. She had her family members raise him while she rarely checks in (probably because of work, or more). His father passed away even before 7. Cancer.
He grew up on the side of the country that’s buzzling with people. The liveliest part.

I don’t see that as a good thing.

The busy it is, the more dangerous it is. Full of godknowswhat in every corner. Dr/ugs, bad people, things I don’t want happening to him.

He got jumped last year by his schoolmates. He told me, I didn’t tell anyone.
No clear reason yet, but it’s serious when violence is involved.
He said some of them had guns. His friends ditched him and he went by himself. There were at least 5 or more of them. Fortunately the whole thing seemed to chill now. 

I tried to act cool when I saw the video, because I know he didn’t want me to fuzz over him. I wouldn’t risk driving him away when he’s opening up to me.
But inside I was restless. I realized then that I don’t want him there.

A few days ago I went to watch him play vball. He had always been the best with sports, and music. The things he plays are the most heavenly shit to me.
Later that night, I saw him in his own room by himself. Just laying in bed. He’s talkative, funny during the day. But I know how he gets quiet at night.

I don’t want him too lost in thoughts so I ask him to walk with me to a convenient store. I was getting him cigarettes (which I really wasn’t supposed to). He asked me earlier that day if I could get them. So now I used it as an excuse for him to walk with me.

We talked. A lot. Well, mostly him speaking to me but I prefer listening anyway. It was a success, really. I’m so glad he feels safe enough to open up while walking next to me, and not just in texts.

He talks about a lot of things. Mostly his friends and things he’d been doing.
And I must say, I wished I had money to get him out of town to a better place.

This baby boy is a damn sweet soul. As rare as that is. And damn anyone who laid a hand in tainting it.

We were talking about other kids. We mentioned one kid who’s just really nice. Listens so well, nice, adorable. 
He said that kid was just like him when he was younger.
He said that like a bad thing.
And it honestly made me sad how we normalized the opposite that a kid finds being nice ‘weird’.

He was bullied a few years back. Probably because he was spoiled. His mother gives him everything in compensation for her absence. 
I felt bad because at that time I was going through deep depression. I hadn’t been nice to him at all. I hate myself that he thought everyone hated him.

He’s been hanging out with the kids from his school. Some of them are the ones that jumped him, I think. He’d been sneaking out to go clubbing, trying out several dr/ugs. (Thankfully mild ones. But I wouldn’t want him touching any of those things. Ever.)

These aren’t good kids. I asked him to be careful. He said it’s the only place he could socialize. And I’m fucking mad that the world is burning up around him that he had to find solace within a bunch of whoresons. And I mean it.

He’s a talented kid. He’ll go far if he’s out of this shithole.

He felt like he was a mistake. That his mother didn’t mean to have him.
But she never knew that. She never knew he felt this way because she was never there. Even people from outside felt bad for him. And he’s not dumb enough to not know what’s going on.
Still, she wasn’t there to change that. And I wasn’t his mother.

I am mad and sad. For my little brother, for other talented kids who're burning out and lead astray while someone who should be close to them never noticed. Or never took it seriously. 
I’m mad at myself too for not being able to do anything more than… This. And listen.

I wished I could tell her all these things, but I couldn’t be honest if I was sober. This doesn’t come easy to me.
But I’ll hold him if he needs it. Anytime."
1qrjnl8,I just kinda skipped,Other,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Set up:
To day was a pepfest at my school and as someone who's autistic I hate them. They are loud crowded and just overstimulating. And I really didn't want to go to school because of this, and my mom is aware of this so she said I could just skip if I wanted. I'm very bad at breaking the rules so I checked to make sure she was ok with it multiple times and then
Play by play:
 after the last class before the pepfest I went to my locker and took an extra long time to open it until everyone was gone then went to the bathroom by the gym so it wouldn't look like I just disappeared then I saw a teacher walking by the exit I normally use so when he walked the other way I snuck over to another door looking to make sure I wouldn't get caught then I walked made sure my mom was fine with me leaving 1 more time then I walked out and snuck out sadly the security cameras saw me but it sounded like only 1 of them was working so, but anyway after that I walked a longer way home so I wouldn't walk infront of the front entrance of the school.

I just don’t fit in for some reason I don’t know if its my accent cos I don’t have that fake dumb roadman accent ALL these stupid kids make, I don’t know if it’s because im too nice or the words I say. I have no clue ok I guess I’m just naturally awkward, any time I open up to anyone like this in my school they just laugh at me and say “you have tons of friends huh? hahaha”. Everyone has this set view of me that just really isn’t true and trust me theres alot to it that they think of me that I just cant change.  I feel like im everyone’s “friend” but no one‘s best friend Im just left with dust. I cant do/say literally anything without getting made fun of when I literally get made of for the most dumb stuff, like in the changing rooms (all the stalls are broken) and everyone has their own little space to get changed and I get made fun of FOR EVERYTHING; for what im wearing, how I look, my build etc. And im not even fat or anything but people make fun of how im built when im like everyone else and they make really weird sexual inappropriate comments about it.

This seems to happen everywhere I go and I’ve been dealing with depression for years and been struggling with a terrible limerence for years for my girl best friend and I feel terrible and a terminally ill brother who only like 60\~ish kids have this condition worldwide or something. Im always taken advantage of I just want to properly love someone and hug them, I want to be so many people’s friend but it just doesnt work also with how boys are nowadays.

1qrit4g,"I think i need help, seriously",Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I'm sorry if this breaks any rule of repetetive posts but I just don't know how to cope. I want a boyfriend so so bad, I envy people in relationships. I'm not happy for them anymore, just a reminder of what i don't have. I know that I don't need a partner to exist, I know that I'm fine, I'll live. But I've been starting to actually go crazy. I am not mentally stable, I pretend I have a boyfriend to get me to sleep. Im lying in his arms, or that anything is just near me. I can't go to sleep otherwise.  And in the morning i just wake up sad to face the reality that there's nothing there. And I'm all alone again. This has been going on for a while, a couple of years.

 I just want to be normal i guess. I've always been quiet, never really had sleepovers or friend friends like that. I haven't been alone like that, just lacking intimacy. Not sx intimacy,  i have sx. But it always just ends, I let men (usually way older) take control of me. And it just leads to me being assaulted. I went to the police once, but they couldn't do anything. They said that it would be a ""he said against he said in court"" and it wasn't worth trying. That caused a depression which I got out of, until i started self hrming. I stopped, i started high school in sweden, doing music which i'm really happy about. But now, I feel it coming back. That same emptyness. Just nothingness. And I'm all alone.

I get that most of these relationships doesn't even last, or matter in the long run. But I just want one now, i am naive and i am despereate. Obviously I want to live out my husband fantasies with the first guy i meet, but i know it wont be like that. I won't last, it wont be good. I know a man can't ""fix me"" and save my life. 

I'm actually going insane, im not joking. I am losing my mind, and I don't wanna spiral back into that dark place. I have friends, my parents love me, i am happy most of the sometimes. I just want a partner. I'm not asking a stranger to love me on reddit. I just want someone to tell me how to stop the want. How can i stop this aching for love."
1qrl4mt,Will she come back or did she lie? (Relationship Advice),Relationship,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Hello, im 18M and my girlfriend is 17F. I am a freshman(ish, transfered in with 24 credits)in college, and she is a senior in High school, she is also going to graduate with her associates as well. We both share the same life goals, which is we both want to become lawyers. Yes this already makes it challenging, but we always told each other we will talk all problems out and try to figure sruff out for each other. 
Unfortunately, 2 weeks ago today, we broke up. We talked about this in person, and she said she wanted to break up to work on herself. She said she wants to get back together soon, but i have a feeling she said that just to dangle a carrot in front of my face. She stated that she will not be getting with any other guys, because she doesn't want to, and I believe her because she has not had a history of doing stuff like that. 
I tried to see if we can find some sort of compromise, such as distancing ourselves from each other but stay dating. But she was committed to breaking up.
I have a feeling she wont want to get back with me. She said we can still talk, but not as much, so I made the initiative to only talk to her once a day, like a message or so. She seems to have done the same. However, we have not spoken for the past 3 days.
 Im a little nervous, and a little sad, but not as much as one normally would be after a break up. Any advice?"

1qr5t77,"Explaining my views on LGBTQ+ as a christian moderate conservative Swede, since people take things too far!",Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"DISCLAIMER: There'll be no TLDR because this is way too deep and complex to summarize into one or two sentences. If you don't want to read this post, don't bother leaving a comment when you don't know what you're commenting on.

However, I strongly recommend anyone to read this! It took a while to write, so I hope that it can provide some value to someone! :)

Hi everyone! This is a serious post about a serious topic, and I want everyone to have an open mind, even though many people in this community have different beliefs and values than I do. I know the mods are also very biased regarding these questions, but I will remain respectful and clear, so please, let this post stay up. A lot of people here need to at least be exposed to a different perspective that isn't filled with hate or poor knowledge, and I will take it upon myself to deliver this. I'm pretty passionate about this, have enough knowledge and understanding to actually be able to talk about it, and love discussing (or arguing if the time, place, and participants allow it).

Let's start with homo/bisexuality

As a christian (specifically protestant (even more specifically progressive evangelical lutheran)), there is in fact no 100% clear ""opinion"" on LGBTQ+ from the Bible. The only things are that gay/lesbian sex is a bad thing. You could argue that this aligns with nature, since neither can create offspring, which is ultimately the ""goal"" with sex, while the pleasure is a way to make the participants ""want"" to do it. Aldo, anal sex, for example, has an increased risk of STIs, which could be used as an argument.

The thing is, the question of whether it's a sin or not is pretty irrelevant to the discussion. It doesn't directly affect me, and if it's a sin, that's between them and God.

However, a parallell topic is the question of homosexual (or even polyamorous) marriage. What a lot of people here seem to not understand is that the christian marriage and a juridical marriage aren't the same thing. A christian marriage is a holy unification between one man and one woman. This was intended by God and has his blessing, and is something we greatly value. It makes a ton of sense that christian marriages are more stable than non-religious marriages, because we view both marrying someone and divorcing someone as a much bigger deal. If two (or more) people decide to marry each other, it's a juridical process, and even though the actual vows is usually held by a priest, it doesn't become a christian marriage.

I think homosexual and polyamorous juridical marriages should be allowed, but as a christian, I tend to value the actual holy unification more than the formalia. Homosexuals can't have a christian marriage, not because they aren't allowed to, but because such a phenomenon simply doesn't exist. Since God only blesses marriages between one man and one woman, other marriages simply don't exist for christians, even though they're juridically valid.

Since priests are christian, they shouldn't be forced to perform juridical non-christian marriages against their will. Everyone can agree that a christian priest shouldn't be forced to perform a hindu marriage, so why should they have to perform a homosexual marriage, that, as previously explained, can't be a true christian marriage no matter what? If you read this and never considered that a christian marriage and a juridical marriage aren't interchangable, you might've not thought about it like this before, but from now on, I hope you do! (Also, don't try to tell me what can be a christian marriage and not if you aren't christian or haven't read the Bible)

Now to the more difficult topic, which is usually more sensitive and controversial, and has larger effects on people (imo):

First of all, it's pretty weird that everything within LGBTQ+ is grouped into one category. Like... even though a guy liking guys and someone calling themselves genderfluid both go against the norm, they're sooo different. It should instead be grouped into two categories, with one being all non-hetero attraction patterns, which I've already talked about, and the other being everything related to gender identity, which I'll talk about now.

Similarly to the former group, I respect the latter group and would never treat anyone worse because of their identity, but I think it's getting more and more out of control (hence the title of this post). To try to explain my viewpoint to people with vastly different views and experiences than me, I usually compare non-cis identities (that can't be explained with genetic mutations e.g. intersex) to my own mental illnesses/disabilities, to visualize how bizarre the whole situation is from my viewpoint:

I have tourette's syndrome and OCD, aka mental illnesses/disabilities. I've been to A LOT of therapy and take a bunch of medications, so now I can live a pretty normal life even though I function differently than neurotypical people. Obsessions and compulsions are truly horrible to experience, and I'm happy to be in a better place now. Everyone around me that know about my diagnoses understand that I can't help it and they don't treat me worse because of it. However, if I were to get some weird obsession, e.g. that if I don't comb my hair perfectly, my head will explode, I would get help to deal with it, but nobody would tell me that this obsession is realistic. I think you see where I'm going with this...

If society, after a lot of lobbyism, started to spread the idea that the obsession I had experienced in fact was realistic, just so I could feel better about myself, would that make sense? After enough indoctrination, especially towards children and teenagers, some people would start feeling the same way. It's purely psychological, how group pressure and repeating indoctrination towards more adaptive/vulnerable minds eventually could have effects. No respectful person would value these people as less human than anyone else, just like you can't be a truly respectful person today while being transphobic (and then I mean ACTUAL TRANSPHOBIA. If you think that this post is transphobic, you gotta relearn what the word means).

Let's say these people started undergoing medical procedures in which their hair was removed and replaced by some kind of super stiff hair thag would always be perfectly combed, ""so their head doesn't split open"". What would you think of that? And if the number of people that started feeling this way (which barely existed a couple decades ago) skyrocketed, what would your thought process best align with out of these two options?

a: These people have always felt this way and it has always existed in the past. It's great that they can finally express their true selves, and we should spread awareness of these ideas upon anyone to make sure that they understand how great this is. Thinking that your head will split if you don't comb your hair perfectly is the truth, and I will fight for this.

b: Something is wrong. Somehow, a small group of people started feeling this way, and only in a couple years, it has spread like a rapid fire among the young population because of media and rapid shifts in societal norms. It's truly sad that they've been convinced that their head will split if they don't comb their hair perfectly, and it's sad that it's encouraged by society.

This is almost identical to the sudden explosive rate of kids and teens becoming trans, non-binary, agender, genderfluid, and all other identities. The idea that gender isn't determined by sex didn't exist until the 70s, and in the last 20 years, anyone around me who is questioning this ""part"" of the LGBTQ+ is seen as insane and disgusting, even though the entire idea is new and baseless.

When I say baseless, I mean that non-cis gender identities are not natural, and that the rapidly increasing number of people with said identities isn't because of an increased acceptance — it's because of an unhealthy normalization, borderline indoctrination.

If you would answer something similar to ""a"" in my example, I assume you don't think gender dysphoria is a mental illess. I do. However, when I use the strongly stigmatized expression ""mental illness"", it shouldn't be connected to actual transphobes calling something a mental illness and moving on. I genuinely think gender dysphoria is a mental illness just like any other, just like my tourette's and OCD. Nobody knows exactly how these diagnoses occur, but it's believed that it's due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Isn't that the same case for gender dysphoria?

Basically, I believe that it should be approached just like other mental illnesses are treated in a developed and accepting society, like Sweden. You regularly meet up with a psychologist, talk about your life and get advice on how to approach your struggles, and you do cbt to slowly but steadily increase your control over your own mind, so you can live a good life. If necessary, medication could be used to help them control their mind, but not to do the opposite, aka helping the distorted mind win (which in this case would be hrt/gender reassignment surgery).

Now when I've explained a little about my viewpoint, the discussion boils down to whether gender dysphoria is a completely different thing than other mental illnesses that should be approached in a completely different way. My honest answer is that it shouldn't, and that it wouldn't be as big or normalized if it wasn't pushed by media, lobbyists, activists, and LGBTQ+ people themselves. If that had never happened, there would still be people with genuine gender dysphoria, just like there are people with OCD, schizophrenia, antisocial personality disorder etc, but a significant portion of people with gender dysphoria today would not have it.

Before ending this post, I just wanna clarify that I'm fully understanding that people feel what they feel, and can't help it. Trust me, I know and I don't blame you. My point isn't that you guys don't have gender dysphoria, it's that many who do would actually not have it if it weren't borderline encouraged in groups like this. It honestly made me sad when I saw one post and one comment the other day from 2 guys who decided to share their insecurities on Reddit, about sometimes being curious of how it would feel being a girl. That was literally everything they said. Then I scroll through the comments/replies, and see how they're bombarded with people saying that they're trans, when there's no actual indication of that. I understand that you mean well, but don't you see how bad it is to project your own problems on vulnerable people, that can actually have long-term effects on them?

As someone living in one of the most ""woke"" countries in the world, things are being taken too far, and I therefore wanted to share some of my views. I hope that you got something out of reading this, that you write a comment about your thoughs (I'm gonna read every single one), and that you have a lovely day! :D"

So one of my friends (we'll call him M) recently (like 2 days ago) bought a realm for our friend group to play on. They are ALREADY arguing because the two of our friends (T and S) teamed up on the M while I was offline having dinner. 

They stole his 9 diamonds and stack of iron, etc. But M seems upset because they also destroyed his bed, so he doesn't even have a way to find his base now. I don't think he even minds about the loot, but destroying the bed was just cruel in his eyes. I sort of see M's point here, since he did spend two hours getting to where he was and I know how annoying it is to lose progress.

The bad part is that S seems to have no sympathy whatsoever. T has not yet been available for comment. And M is quite sensitive (I think it's because he's somewhere on the spectrum) so idk how this is going to go at school 🫠

1qqjkzt,The single biggest regret from my teenage years,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I‘ve been thinking about this a lot recently sharing it might be helpful for some people.

I‘m 19 years old, turning 20 soon, and objectively my teenage and especially high school years went quite well. My grade were alright most of the time, most people liked me and I had a bunch of friends. I‘d say I was a part of the „cool kids“, if you want to frame it like that.

So what‘s the flaw here? Well, from the outside, everything seemed great, and to be fair it was at times, but I never felt completely satisfied and happy. I was not authentic at all and cared way way WAY much about what other people were thinking of me. With everything I did and said, I was worrying about how I would be portrayed and seen. I never wanted to stand out and one of the worst things I could imagine was people talking about me negatively. I desperately wanted to fit in and liked by everyone. I rarely spoke out my opinion and said yes to basically everything no matter how I thought about it. Everything I said went through some kind of „filter“ in my head to make sure it wouldn‘t be cringe or uncool at all costs. I had a lot of „secret“ hobbies and interests that I told almost no one about or gave up completely because they were „nerdy“ or simply uncommon. Everytime someone asked a question about me I tried to say the „right“ answer instead of just being honest. So most people didn‘t actually know a lot about me or had a completely inauthentic picture of me. At gatherings and parties I often had the feeling of being invisible and not really bringing anything to the table. I felt like most people didn‘t really care wether i was there or not, and looking back, it was no wonder. Of course people didn‘t care about me if I surpressed almost everything that would’ve made me interesting and unique. I was being a painfully average and boring guy who seemed chill and friendly, but nothing more. Always afraid of being laughed at or talked about and a huge people pleaser. I had very low self esteem and didn‘t even give it a chance to grow.

Don‘t get me wrong, I’ve made a lot of great memories in the last years. I do have a few friends that I can be more or less myself around, and also had some great and fun moments with people who didn‘t really know me the way I am. But I keep looking back and thinking what these years would‘ve been like if I would‘ve just been myself a little more. Maybe some moments would have been more difficult and some people would‘ve not liked me. But it would‘ve also made a lot of things more enjoyable and less stressful. The people that would have liked me would have done so for what i really was instead of what I was trying to be. I think I would have had more fun.

To a certain extent, trying to fit in and caring a lot about what other people think is normal during this age. But if I‘d have to give one advice to someone younger than me I‘d tell them to at least try to stay true to themselves. You don‘t need to be liked by everybody, it’s way better to have fewer people like you for who you really are. Eventually people will notice if you are not being yourself anyway. I often stumble across the quote „Being cringe is being free“ and I strongly agree. Sometimes it‘s better to stand out for being cringe or weird than to not stand out at all. 

The biggest resolution I have for my 20s is just doing the things that **I** want to do, no matter what other people think of it."

About me:

19(turning 20)

Love anime, especially deep and heartfelt/meaningful anime’s. But, I’m a sucker for a good shonen/action.

Big on webtoons, but also wattpad, ao3….the spiral.

I like art, appreciating artwork and drawing

Listens to a bunch of different music, except country i just hate it(sorry) even though i only got 87k minutes this year, i still think it’s enough to say i listen to music a lot.

Im also a dj so, I guess that ties into all of this.

Big Dark humor enjoyer, but that doesn’t mean it’s my only humor, so if it’s not for you, feel free to point that out, no worries.

And love for video games, probably shaped like 80% of me.

Also, if you’re just looking for advice, I’m also down for that.

If you’re looking for someone to talk to, I’d love to be that. I’ll put in this little snippet I sent someone else in:

If you want to talk, let me know, l'm a 19 year old guy, but l've had my own experiences that I hope can help me help you out somehow

And, quite frankly, this is time l'd love to spend helping someone.

So don't feel ""I'm wasting this guys time"" or

""he's doing it for me""

I'm here because a long time ago, I put a paragraph on the internet about how my mind was falling apart, and I was gonna end it. Just like I am now, someone reached out, and we talked.

It took a couple conversations, but it worked.

So maybe you'll see this, and if you do, text back."

sorry to all my wlw warriors out there, this isn’t for you because girls are more understanding overall (sorry boys)

by autism I don’t mean she’s silly, and abit slow understanding things, I mean she struggles with social interactions, struggles to understand her own feelings, can be rude without realising it, has sensory issues, gets irritated easily ect. 

**Autistic traits (speaking from experience as a girl with asd):**

* Not good at understanding jokes, body language,tone or sarcasm and can come off as rude without meaning to.
* Can be embarrassment in public, very loud, blurts out things and interrupts when you’re speaking because when she thinks of something she needs to say it there and then.
* Attachment issues
* Can push you away when she’s upset 
* Lots of energy and hyperactive at times.
* Copies peoples personalities to seem more normal and ‘mask’
* Fidgets and stims, might pace round in circles, need to be fiddling with something or won’t sit still in general.
* Asks ‘stupid’ questions and does ‘stupid’ things
* Doesn’t think before she talks or acts.
* Bad sense of direction 
* Trouble with staying organised and is always late for most things (appointments and going out ect.)
* Needs breaks after social stuff because it drains her energy fast.
* Struggles with routines because she either needs a strict routine or struggles to have one at all.
* Loses track of time easily and gets distracted
* Never finishes what she starts (projects)
* Gets easily overwhelmed, irritated and loud by crowded or chaotic places.
* Finds talking about feelings difficult, sometimes can’t figure out her own"

I have our, let's call him Carl, and Carl is one of, if not the most popular kids that I know. He does things like theatre and band that give him popularity within those groups but are normally looked down upon in a whole sense.

 

However, he still seems to have ammased a popularity that I see in very few others, and I anticipate this is because of his social chameleon like nature. I understand a little bit of a variation between friend groups. However, I'm talking full personality switches here.

Also, whenever he's having a conversation you can tell that he is always catering to exaclty what the other person has to say. So I'm wondering how exactly can people get behind that becuase honestly it really just bugs me. So I wonder if I'm just reading Carl better than people who are normally pulled into his conversation but to me it just feels so obvious that he's doing it and at least to me it makes it feel nay impossible to actually talk with him."

1qpr5gh,"Male 16, torn apart by lust and hate.",Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Male 16, 5'5 tall, or rather 5'5 short. I am a Christian, but hate and lust are tearing me apart.



For as long as I can remember, I was, and still am one of the shortest people in my class. And if that wasn't enough, I have a face of a 12 year old. And I have been bullied for that for as long as I can remember. I am not athletic, I even struggule with small weights, scared to go to the gym, because I don't want to show people how terrible I am. And everytime I look in the mirror when working out, I lose motivation, because I know I won't ever be handsome or shit like that. And some of that is due to my lack of discipline. I know painfully well that I will always be on the losing side when compared with other guys. And my parents don't see an issue at all with my appearance, they say that I should workout and go to therapy, but I don't want to go to therapy. I feel like therapy is for the weak, and I don't want to feel even weaker than I am now. I once went to a doctor, and she said that the growth sprout is already behind me, and I will grow to maybe 5'8. Parents refuse to believe that, and they are still trying to give me hope, but I know very well, that there is no hope.



I would want to meet a girlfriend, I want to be loved and I want to make that girl feel loved. I am perfectly aware that in my current state, a girlfriend won't cure all my problems. Although a relationship would certainly help my confidence. I don't live in America, I live in Europe, so coming up to girls and asking them for instagram doesn't work here, and it's frowned upon. In Europe you meet people through events, or mutual friends. In school there are no hobby groups whatsoever, so the only way to meet other people is to go to the toilet and vape. But I don't want to vape or smoke, and based on my interactions with that ""community"" so far, I am not welcome there. I once lost a fight to a guy my height and my weight, and I lost spectacularly. I lost with my ""friend"" after we argued about one thing. But I don't really like him to be honest, even though I have lost, I see myself as superior to him. Because he only cares about memes, about trends, he is is an idiot in the most literal sense possible. And here comes the problem, the male is supposed to protect the girl, but I know I can't provide that. 



And everytime I see a couple, or a handsome guy, or a jacked up guy, there is a small amount of sadness which fires up the hate inside of me. When I am at home, this hate turns into rage, it's overwhelming any other emotions inside of me for half an hour or so. There are some guys in my school that are younger than me and get all the girls, the most attractive ones, even ones that are older than themselves. I know I can't compete with them, and it's so fucking painful that no matter what I do, I have no chance. I hate them for that, pure hate and anger. I know one of them, he is not even rude to me or something like that, but I hate all of them, because they have this important thing that I don't have. Looks, and with that, confidence. In the current society, I feel like the most important thing for people are looks. I don't show what I feel inside at school, as I know that would make me the public clown.



I also struggle with lust, I am addicted to porn, and I hate that addiction. I watch porn daily, I want to break free, but I can't. I've been fighting with lust for like 2 years now. When I try to stop my addiction, I feel like shit, and I break at like day 3 or 4. I pray for God's help in me breaking the chains of lust, but there is something inside of me that causes me to sometimes not even resist the urge. And the problem is that everywhere you go, ""experts"" experts say that it's normal for a teen to masturbate, but I know it's not. I sometimes have that spark, to take my life back, but I am reminded everytime I look in the mirror that my mission is bound to fail.



Often I ask God, why is it like that? Why is my body like that? I wan't to achieve great things, but my body is limiting me. Why can't I break free from lust and hate? I know most of you are atheist, so you might not understand my religiousness. Even though I feel all that hate, I don't want to live like that, I am not evil, just desperate, I just want to be happy and live how God intended."
1qpphe9,18 and conflicted about a hookup opportunity — how do you weigh experiences vs personal values?,Serious,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"I’m 18 (just turned), and I’m feeling really conflicted about a situation. A girl I’ve already hooked up with wants to come over while I’m home alone. There’s mutual respect and consent, and I’m not worried about safety or pressure. I also don’t think parents or close friends would find out.

What’s bothering me is more internal. After the first time we hooked up, I felt regret that lasted about a week, then it went away. Now I’m trying to understand whether that regret actually means something important, or if it’s just anxiety and overthinking. I don’t think what I’d be doing is inherently wrong, and part of me feels like I’m young and these kinds of experiences are normal and exciting at this age.

At the same time, I have personal and cultural values (I’m Jewish) that make me care a lot about privacy and how I see myself afterward. I wouldn’t want this to be known by people, even if nothing bad happened. I can see both sides clearly: enjoying the experience and accepting a few days of mental noise afterward, or choosing peace and skipping it.

I’m not looking for validation either way. I’m genuinely curious how other people think through situations where desire and values don’t fully line up. How do you decide what’s worth it?"
1qpocf3,How do you guys listen to music?,Music,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"I’m lowkey curious because I feel like the way I listen to music is kinda weird compared to other people. Usually, I’ll get really into one artist at a time and just play their liked songs over and over. Like for a few days or maybe a week, I’ll be convinced they’re my favorite artist ever, no question.

Then out of nowhere, it just stops I don’t even hate the music or anything, I just randomly lose the urge to listen and end up moving on to a completely different artist. Then the same cycle happens again. another artist… then eventually I drift away again.

It’s not even on purpose either. My taste just rotates constantly, and sometimes I’ll come back to an artist months later and wonder why I ever stopped listening in the first place. I don’t really stick to one sound or one genre for that long, it’s more about phases. Its happened since last year freshman year I really just kept listening to Kendrick for like months and months and then suddenly I jus dont want to no more It never used to be like that I used to just love music without overthinking or anything 

I was wondering if anyone else listens to music like this or if most people actually stay locked in with their favorite artists for long periods of time. Is this normal or am I just constantly in music phases "
1qpn2ur,Is my mom's glazing getting way too weird?,Discussion,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"So my mom (F43) has always complimented me for my looks, saying I'm handsome and stuff, which I assume most mothers do with their children. Average mother glaze I (M15) always think, but some things she does is kinda weird I guess?

She always says stuff similar to ""I would push all the girls away at school if I was your age"", and I thought it was a normal thing to say but some of my friends said its weird. I always thought it was normal mom glazing.

Also she said like thrice about being ""in love"" and saying I look perfect just because I got my braces removed? Which i'd say is exaggerating it's not that big of a deal

But she also sometimes just... Randomly slaps my butt for absolute no reason???? Like I'm not a baby anymore, why are you doing this it's weird, and she says it's because she 'made me' so it's 'fine'

Now I can defend this all being motherly love, sometimes exaggerated but something I still cringe remembering this day is when she called me ""big tasty"" for like 4 days, thankfully this nickname stopped because it was so cringy 😭 but the worst part is this translated into ""gostosão"" in our language which is often used in an innapropiate way to say the least. I mean she does not know english and this nickname might be too recent for her to know since she used to think cringe meant old, but yeah what do you guys think? Is this normal or is the glazing getting too weird?"
1qplgb2,Are we living in the matrix?,Discussion,Peer Normalization,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"What’s going on with society? Both political spectrums is filled with dum dums who think they’re smarter than everyone. Now I’m not a centrist but I do believe leftist have this weird moral superiority complex and feel that they must be politically correct. Both right wingers and left wingers repeat the same talking points from their echo chambers and it’s genuinely pathetic. 

Literacy is mostly nearly dead so I know for a fact most people get their info from ChatGPT. No one goes to read, go to museums, they don’t do anything to Englighten themselves and would rather get their info from TikTok or fox or Gb news. 

Everyone’s dumb now and right wingers keep voting and enabling lunatic right wing politicians who are now targeting everyone but the rich, any sort of logic is thumped by hate. It’s ridiculous. 

Everyone’s so performative and just curate their new personality every 3-6 months, not knowing who they’ll be by august. Every “intellectual” has the same microphone, same whispery voice, same book recommendations and same mannerisms. Everyone does the same poses, the same pout. 

The looksmaxxing community is taking advantage of young boys, specifically vulnerable white boys, they’re exploiting their insecurities. They’re telling young boys that they’re worth is measured by how attractive they are and basically instilling shallowness into them. Any sane girl that isn’t shallow doesn’t necessarily care about how you look but the contents of your personality. Let’s be honest the only reason many of you cant get girls is cause ur horrible not cause ur “ugly”

Women think that soft life is the way to go but it’s really just the patriarchy repackaged in soft coquette bows, women are being told that it’s normal to sell their bodies in exchange of luxuries. That’s not empowerment it’s just prostitution. Young girls are now relying on men, rather than growing. Isn’t that ridiculous? 

Apparently bigotry is an opinion, I never got the memo, people would rather be willingly ignorant rather than educated, how have we regressed so much in the span of 10 years, like what’s going on? 

I know some people will miss the point of this, either downvote me or argue with me for no good reason as many of u do on here."
1qpl8z0,Is it normal to freeze up around your crush???,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"idk where to post this so i came to all y'all to beg for advice. normally i'm quite outgoing and funny, i can usually twist anything into a conversation but around my crush i completely freeze up and the conversation rarely goes beyond can i borrow a pen in class. please give me some advice - not even to pull him just to function like a normal human being."
1qpjo0c,anyone else feel this way,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"i’m 16 and i’m in 11th grade. all i can think about is how shitty the world is, we’re all so divided, and we’re all slaves. we’re actually the best of slaves, we don’t depend on out masters, we seek work to afford food and somewhere to call home, we buy our own cages and our chains and shackles are things like drugs, alcohol and various other additions. i wake up and i go to school for what? to learn about trigonometry?

all school is a system to keep us in place and teach us to not question anything, they even teach us complete nonsense just for the sake of keeping us oblivious to what’s truly happening, they feed us genetically modified bullshit and call it a meal, then send us back to our ‘education’ dungeons. it teaches us that we have to adhere to the rules of the system and if we don’t we become an outcast, we are being taught that being different is wrong, i used to bully kids for being different because that’s what made sense at the time, being normal was optimal and beating down the people who are themselves is what seemed correct. obviously i’ve changed my ways and i’ve seen that it’s easier to be happy but how can i be happy when all that I’m surrounded by is negativity. in my own household all i see is negativity my 3 little siblings stuck to their electronics frying their dopamine receptors and eating slop, or my mom yelling at my stepdad and vise versa. i can’t even go into my fridge and get something healthy, there’s pop with bits of human in it for flavor enhancement, or a mystery meat pizza. i can’t even do something as simple as take a shower or drink water without thinking what chemicals my body is absorbing. even the very clothes i wear, each time i wash them microplastics shed and the next time i put them on they seep into my flesh. the things introduced to us as modern medicine are just placebos or literal toxins that actively weaken us and keep us dumb, advertised as healthy and progressive. wholesome things too; Feminism, black lives matter, LGBTQ movements, they’re all an orchestrated scam to further divide the population so we will forever be cattle to the elites. i hope for a future where there is peace, but i can clearly see that that won’t happen at least in my lifetime. i see all of these things happen and i think why doesn’t someone fight back? or better yet lead an army of people who want to fight back? it’s because they will most likely lose. American is a slave to a ‘country’ no bigger then fucking New Jersey, why is that i wonder, maybe because they’ve placed themselves in every corporation, founded by THEM or Americans and they’ve taken over. is what i would say if i was ignorant, the true root of evil is the ones who use the jews as a scapegoat. these people that we don’t even know because they’re so secretive. to a degree i’ve accepted that i will be a wageslave for the rest of my life. i want to commit suicide and i’ve thought about it very heavily but i know it’s not the way. no matter how tempting it seems i will not take my own life. i need to find my own happiness. but that happiness is hard to come by when it’s actively being taken away."
1qpdr3g,Relationship advice: She flirted earlier but then backed off abruptly,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So​‍​‌‍​‍‌ i (16m) met a girl (16f) on reddit in november and we initially chatted casually but soon it turned very flirty very fast.

In fact, for about the last month and a half we have been texting literally every day. She'd call me cute names, she'd say really romantic stuff like she's committed to me, that she's loyal, possessive about me, all that. We would keep on flirting with each other all the time and she seemed just amazingly into it. She even told me that she rejected a guy who was hitting on her in class for me.

I seriously thought that there was something real between us. When she was worried about exams i was there for her, when she was sad i tried to cheer her up.

Yesterday i requested her number since reddit notifications suck and i wanted to talk more conveniently, right after that everything went wrong. And remember, I didn't even force her, she could have refused and I would have had no problem.

She completely turned on me. Out of the blue, i'm a ""stranger"" and she's questioning ""who the hell asks for numbers on reddit."" She told i was ""just basic flirting"" and that online friends do this all the time and that i'm immature for getting emotionally involved and that saying cute things doesn't imply that she's actually into me.

bro i have no idea what to make of it. she also said that she told me she likes someone else??? She never said that, in fact she literally said the opposite.

Currently, she is saying that i am overreacting and that i don't understand the concept of basic online friendships. that i lack ""emotional maturity"" because i thought it was something.

i feel like i'm losing my mind. did i really misread everything? like when someone flirts with you heavily every day for weeks and says romantic stuff, isn't it normal to think they harbor feelings for you?

or is she just gaslighting me now because she doesn't want to feel guilty about leading me on?

i literally can not stop crying and i feel so dumb. my chest hurts so bad. i really cared about her and now i've got a feeling that everything was a lie
was i wrong for catching feelings? did i somehow mess ​‍​‌‍​‍‌up?

1qpeu29,I think my mom knows i masturbate. What am I supposed to do?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Okay so I'm female, still living with my parents (of course). And at this age and by this point, I know that masturbation and this hormonal stuff is completely normal. 

But idk how my parents feel about this cuz obviously, I've never talked to them about and I never plan on doing so. 

But here's the thing. I think my mum knows. First of all, I have a room of my own, but it's basically not even my private room at this point because my mom sits there on the bed and works on her computer while I work on my desk. It's annoying, yes. And I've tried to talk to her about it, but she won't budge. Cuz apparently sitting on the bed in my parents' room hurts her back cuz the mattress is too soft. I don't think she's lying, but she's definitely using this to be stuck and stubborn about this. So i can't argue.

Anyway, so in the evenings, my parents typically go out for a while (think 15-25 minutes). So this is basically my only timeframe to touch myself. And I do. Generally 2-5 times a week.

But of course, they're generally back before I'm able to finish. They've also been coming back earlier than usual these days (around 15 minutes). And my mom comes back to my room immediately after she returns home most of the time.

So i usually just go into the bathroom or the other bedroom with my phone in hand and finish there. I'm also never loud or make any noise, so that's not a problem. But I'm often unable to finish properly cuz of the interruption.

To be clear, I haven't outright been caught, but I think my mom knows. Cuz well, i literally am in the bathroom when she comes home, or I go to the other bedroom. She's suspicious, that's for sure.

And my mom is an adult. She's not stupid, she would have to know about the fact that girls my age have harmones and often masterbate. But idk, her behaviour is a lil bit odd? She's a bit avoidant after i come back out. I act normal but she doesn't, or maybe I'm just overthinking this. She is a bit religious though. Not overly, but definitely more than I am.

Idk. Have any of you gone through anything similar? How did you deal with it? Any and all advice will be appreciated.

(Tldr: female teen. My mom usually sits in my room the whole day. I think she knows i masterbate cuz I'm usually in the bathroom/other bedroom to finish when she comes back home from her short walk. Advice is appreciated.)"

1qp2xn2,What do you think of my friends on Fortnite?,Social,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"and all today my friend did something to make sure I didn’t win, like one of my friends “prepared” and he said this a few times “if you kill me your gay” or “if you do \_\_\_\_ you like men” and that works on everybody and me, and one time, my friend said “ok Jae so it you vs my brother if you lose your gay or my brother lose he likes “some girl they know from school”” and I lose and I was like “NO!” NO!” And it was because I was goofy around and playing because I know I am better then “ double D” (crazy gamer, brother) and he is one of the worst players I ever seen, but after I lost crazy gamer said “JAE YOUR GAY! Oh NAH! I can’t BE AROUND GAY PEOPLE THEY GROSS” and I ask for a rematch and won, but today when I was playing I killed one of my friends and it was one more personal alive, and she was a girl, and this person named “ went to the head” has two people on the same Fortnite account a brother and a sister they both share every 30 minutes of the day, and it was her turn, and I found her and my friend said “if you kill her your like her” and I was like “ we both know what he meant like a crush but he said “like” that can mean friend, but I knew how he meant it and I didn’t want him to tell her something like “Jae has a crush on you” or whatever so I waiting into shed died from being afk but the whole time he was afk and when he came back it looked like I killed her,

I am 13 of now, my birthday was January 17 and it is Jan 27,

And that same girl after she heard him and everyone say “if you do x your gay” she started doing it like “if you put me in prison your gay Jae” or when she was talking to everyone she said “if you touch me your gay” (me as soon as I hear that: why did you have to use that type of word? “ touch.” You made it Sus)

I did and and they denied and when I did the same thing “hey guys if you put me in jail you like men besides “lean to the head” because she was a girl” they did they said “it doesn’t apply to me but my family is super strict so I am not allowed to say any form of a bad word like h\*ll or a\*s or gay,

And after a few days ago I want to tell my mom this but she said every time “ nope don’t tell me, because if you tell me I probably get mad and do mom stuff and you will get mad at me for doing mom stuff” and one time she even said she thinking about me “ removing all my friends and starting over” and I was like “NOPE!”

I told her this “ people keep saying if you don’t do x your bad at the game” instead of “if you do this your gay” and she just laughed and thought it was just a thing kids do,

Remember how I said that girl had to have the same account as her brother, and they spit every 30 minutes on Fortnite,  and I can do the same thing to the guys that did that to me, “prepared” (that his Fortnite name) and said “if you kill her you like her” and he probably wouldn’t care and kill her and then I can tell her brother and boom!

And one of my friends said this to me and my friend “ crazy gamer” and we are both black, and him was losing and some  why he said “THAT WHY YOUR BLACK!” And he sounded black so why did he said this, it didn’t affect none of us but it had me thinking “why did he said that”

Crazy gamer-

The only person who is my equal on Fortnite skill, and we keep 1 v 1 and we both keep saying that the other is better but he can be a little toxic,and rage a little and when he rage he go try-hard and roast everyone and said bad words constantly, and he was the guy about the cartoons, he is 14, he is the younger brother of “double D”, and is one year older then me,

prepared-

He is 10 and he told me he been saying bad words since he was 3, and he can be rude and recently he blocked crazy gamer because he kicked him from his party because he wanted his real life friend only, but most of his friends are like 14-(rally 11-14)-5 and playing with little kids can be annoying,

Balance-

My favorite friend but he live in Washington state and I live in dc moving to Florida, so it kinda hard for us to play because he get out of school at like my 8-9 pm and it 3-4 for him, he kinda normal but at first I thought he was my only friend who did you say bad words into he we hear his sister crying and yelling the b-word like 28 times and he went back there was arguing with him and his 3-5 year old sister, and he came back

and said “sorry my sister is being a b-word”

When I been off Fortnite and I told my mom the kids was making fun of me for watch a cartoon and almost 13 and they all my mom bring their devices to school like my friend was playing Fortnite on the school bus a few days ago but she said “WHAT HOW THESE KIDS MAKING FUN OF YOU FOR WATCHING CARTOON! I AM A GROWN WOMEN AND I WATCH CARTOONS! These kids are probably mad because they PROBABLY DON’T HAVE CABLE OR STREAMING! What they sit on Fortnite all day! 12 HOURS NONSTOP! They probably lost cable when cable cost for money. It wasn’t free no more!  They probably had a social services cable! These kids bully toy for almost any day! Probably bad parenting! who let these kids bring their devices to school we’re not talking about a phone A WHOLE NINTENDO AND HEADPHONES if you was not homeschool I be right at the door to see what your bringing ti school and if I don’t do that I be right at the door and say “ give me your Nintendo” and these moms and dads will let their kids say bad words back to back and don’t even care what their kids are doing! Even grown-ups watch cartoons! How would cartoon network be here right now?! YOU SHOULD TELL THESE KIDS THE NEXT TIME THEY MAKE FUN IT YOU FOR LIKING CARTOON THAT “I am actually having a real childhood ” “ that mostly what I remember,

Ik this might be an odd post but I know a lot of teens and other people struggle with brushing their teeth for multiple reasons, and this is a type of brushed used for the elderly, people with sensory issues like me, and just people who may need an alternative way to take care of their dental hygiene that have issues with normal brushes or say motor skills or dexterity of the hands. So anyway I just wanted to share I’m finally on my way to having healthy teeth when I’m older and hopefully this can help anyone else my age on this sub who may be looking for alternative brushes.

1qou51u,I can’t deal with my religious mum anymore,Advice,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"context: my mum is an extremely strict Muslim and she has no clue that I don’t share her beliefs

i am the youngest of seven siblings and there is a pretty large age gap between me and my sibling closest in age.

in the house it’s just me and my mum most of the time. like a normal teen I ask to go out every once in a while but anytime I do she thinks im being rebellious because going out is an “evil thing”. recently she has become a lot stricter on what I wear. say im wearing jeans, a jumper that covers my arse and a head covering. she would go ballistic and try to get me to wear something “decent”. sometimes i just walk out and she calls me crying like ten minutes later. sometimes she starts calling me a whore or devils spawn. other times it’s her guilt tripping me with how much she has given up to raise me. yes I am grateful for everything I have but she can’t just try to mould me into the perfect daughter by doing that.

worst of all is she is always policing me. for example: im sitting on the couch with my legs up to my chest. my mum will see that and say it is 3ayb (disgraceful) because if i do that at home ill do it in public and sully the family’s name. Like she won’t even admit that my brother is gay and never talks about him because he is “no longer apart of the family he has shamed”. I’d honestly bet my savings that my mum cares more about how others perceive our family than our actual wellbeing. lol

cant wait to move out :3

1qot0vi,Are my parents normal/good parents for this?,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So, I'm 16 years old and I recently got a girlfriend about 3 months ago. She's very nice to me, her family loves me a lot, but my parents have been nothing but a thorn in our sides. My parents have done nothing but restrict our relationship and nitpick tiny things she does as ""immature"", such as not looking at my parents when they talk to her, she usually looks over to me. From saying things like how they think my relationship will end and how they even want that, to only allowing me to hang out with her once a week to ""take it slow"", despite her parents offering me rides both ways and welcoming me to come over any time. They are very anti-any sort of physical contact, and actually kicked my girlfriend out of the house for laying too close to me while we were watching YouTube together. Meanwhile, everybody at her house allows us to cuddle all day and they don't even care at all.  
Whenever I ask for reasons for anything they do, they always either don't answer or come up with some bullshit reason that I can't even comprehend, then get mad when I say I can't comprehend it. For example, my parents recently banned ""sleep calling"" with my girlfriend because they think it's sexual and that ""I'm not old enough for that level of intimacy."" I said that made no sense and they got mad.  
Is this regular, has anyone had any experiences with this? I've tried literally everything, but they have no respect for me or anybody else so it seems I'm stuck."

1qop2y2,i need help but no one's listening,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I'm not taken seriously when I'm asking for help. I'm trying to phrase it in a way that feels urgent.

I'm 17 and i drink regularly. sometimes it gets worse, i drink multiple days on a week. maybe every second day or every day. i got sick a few times and i got an alcohol poisoning scare that made me stay clean for almost a month. but I'm still drinking. 

it's affecting my life. i do feel like shit after drinking and I'm worried for my health. I'm very lazy, no schoolwork done and my room is a mess. I'm paying more attention to personal hygiene but there was a time when i didn't. I'm keeping up with stuff though, life goes on, I'm not bedridden and i can function. with occasional drinking. 

i think this is a serious matter because i drink to think more positively. and I've been feeling bad lately, like constantly sick, faint, dizzy and shaky. I'm very anxious about stuff and drinking makes it easier to deal with for a day. but i don't want to fuck up my health. i don't know when to stop until I've already overdone it.

people say that alcohol ruins lives. i don't think it's got to me yet but i won't recognize it when it will and that scares me. but i can't quit. nothing else replaces it. if i quit one thing, I'll start another. i need something to take the edge off and nothing does it the way alcohol does.

my mom's worried about me. i don't know how much she knows. I've thrown up in this house before because of drinking too much so she must've heard. should i come clean to her? it's really going to change our family dynamic and i don't want that. is it worth it to stir everything up because of it? 

I've tried talking to my friends but they think it's normal. like I'm normal drinking, not drinking drinking. and there's only the internet where i can say stuff but here, i often find myself speaking to a brick wall."
1qomwos,My friends inadvertently made me really insecure. Tw for mentions of starving??,Rant,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Just wanted to get this off my chest and tell someone or no one about it. But today at break time in school me and a few of my friends were all talking but then the conversation somehow shifted to weight when one of them was talking about their boyfriend. The were talking about what different measurements equalled in kg/lbs and I was the only person who knew roughly how to change between the two. I’ve always been insecure about my weight — I’m not overweight, but I’m almost overweight I think and I’m absolutely not as skinny as most girls in my year group. So they all asked me ‘what is \[weight\]kg in lbs?’ Or vice versa; and they were clearly talking about their own weight. And all of them were less than how much I weigh — not by much, but still less. I told them the rough conversions before just kind of going quiet for the rest of break and the rest of the day. I was half way through a packet of crisps because I don’t have lunch for another two hours after break, but the conversation made me feel shitty about that so I put the rest in the bin. I didn’t eat anything at lunch because of obvious reasons. I think it might be worth mentioning that I’ve had a history of starving myself for days or weeks at a time and I’m not sure if my friends know that, though I like to think that they don’t. My English teacher pulled me out of 4th lesson to ask why I wasn’t focussing so it was clearly obvious; but my friends didn’t seem to notice except for one who asked ‘you good?’ In those exact words, then didnt speak to me for the rest of the day when I said yeah. But yeah I’m not sure what I should do but I just wanted to talk about this because I’m not sure if this is normal for a 14 year old to be concerned about"
1qoli5j,Idk how should I feel rn,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"**SUMIRAZATION?:** Here’s a clear, shorter summary:

The user found out that a guy who used to tease/bully them (mostly before October–November) actually has a crush on them. Friends confirmed it by asking him directly, and he admitted it again, getting visibly embarrassed. The user was shocked and confused by this.

People around them had mixed reactions: one sister thought it was cute and teasing can mean liking someone, another said not to focus on it and that dating isn’t allowed, and the best friend warned against it because the guy and his friend group have a bad reputation (playboys, bullies, rude, body-shaming). The teasing included mocking the user’s African name and mixing English and Dutch.

The user doesn’t find the guy ugly but doesn’t fully trust him or his friends. They also mention another guy they genuinely have a crush on, plus some “eye candy” they don’t want to date because he’s known to be a playboy. Due to past bad experiences with crushes, they’re cautious.

In the end, the user doesn’t plan to ask the guy out, feels awkward about the situation, and is unsure what to do, but plans to just act normally and not pursue anything.

**LONG VERSION:** So today I found out this guy had has lwk been ig “bullying me” for a while (he stopped somewhere around October-November) he has a crush on me?…I was told this during lunch break and I thought this was a joke since it’s hard to believe, and my friends who told me this were like ‘no, no ?my name? It isn’t a joke he actually said he has a crush on you” so we went to him and I hid so he didn’t see me, and they asked him again, and after a few secs they rushed out again and dragged me inside cuz he actually said it again that eh has a crush on me! And I was acc so flabbergasted 😲 like wym!??

Anyways his best friend was joking adding freak to the fire ig, and he was like saying no, but when they asked again ‘do you have a crush on ?my name?’ He got quiet again and u could see him getting more red. And im not going to lie and say that he’s ugly (my friends think every guy I like us ugly as fuck) and like I asked my best friend abt this and my sisters, so my older sister:’oh cute, anemones to lovers, meisjes plagen is liefde vragen’ (its a Dutch rhyme) and my second older sister says:’u shouldn’t take it to heart and think about it or focus on it’(she does agree that he has a crush on me but she says im not allowed to have a boyfriend??) and my best-friend says:’I don’t care it’s your life and do what you want, but like don’t cuz him and his friends aren’t good ppl, ze zij echt marginale kleintjes” and i agree w her, cuz his friends r all just: “playboys, f boys, guys who think they are tuff, bullies, bodyshamers, and genuinely just very very rude and bad ppl.” And they r, I mean him and his best friend kinda used to “tease/bully” me, it was mostly like teasing me w my name cuz it’s an African name and not easy to pronounce, and also kinda teasing/ laughing at the fact that I mixed English w Dutch a lot, since I don’t know all the words in Dutch and I usually know the words in English.

At first I tought u hated him and his best friend but I don’t, cuz they are both acc kinda good looking, and his bestfriend has a GF and idk I wouldn’t date his bestfriend I just wouldn’t, but like I also think one of his friends r pretty, but not in a crush way but more of an ‘eye candy way’ cuz my friend says “ ?my name? If u get tgt with Ed$$ (the eye candy’s name is Ed$$) I’ll stop being friends w you, he’s such an asshole and a playboy and a fboy, he’s gonna use u, he has so manny girls on his snap n stuff.” And I also know that, I’m very aware that he’s a playboy, and I also know that a girl tht I used to be friends with and a crush on him,(girls intuition) and I don’t want to date him, since I do have a guy in my class i actually have a crush on, but like, I’ve had a bad experience w having a crush so like I have multiple yk. Anyways I don’t know what I should do, I’m also not gonna ask the guy that has a crush on me to b my bf, cuz that’s rly embarrassing and what if he says no (he’s a 😒tuff😒 guy and wouldn’t say yes cuz he’d be embarrassed) but like yeh, any advice?? I’m just gonna treat the guy that likes me as I used to do and just look at my eye candy’s cuz wtv.

1qokpx9,not any amount of the greatest shit ever could save me rn (pic unrelated),Rant,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"rant post cuz i feel the worst in like genuine months rn

so like tomorrow is yet another day of school, which im already WAY to tired from with all the bullshi going on in my class, but tomorrow is also PE, on skis for whatever fucking reason there could be. and im, aswell as like 97% of my classmates, extremely fucking infuriated. yeah, let's roam around for like 10 mins for a maximum like C+ on a good day instead of actually good lessons. and also why not make it cost an obnoxious amount of money every time. because of why tf no. i wouldnt mind this THAT much tbh, if not for my goddamn mother. she gives way to much of a fuck about skipping literally any class ever, even with bs like this. she wanted me to come to school a few days ago when it was literally -30° C outside btw. like some schools just outright close when this happens. she does not fucking concern herself in any shape or form whatsoever, just for a reason to be ""i dont want my child to stay at home when its -30 outside"" like that feels like a genuine joke rather than an actual response. fucking hell. 

anyway, back to the actual thing i was talking about. she like REALLY hate it when i skip classes. especially with pe for whatever goddamn love she has got that class. which is like the worst fucking thing ever to me. i basically got an ultimatum from whatever god of luck this is:

either actually spend my time (AND MONEY BTW) in pe for a bad grade and unfun time

or skip it for even worse grade (i really dont gaf about that) but have actually good time, until my mom gets home and probably beats me. 

battle of piss and shit, isnt it? well yeah it fucking is. and this shit comes up EVERY time theres some school bullshit like this. and im so fucking irritated every time. this time its worse tho, because normally that would happen like... maybe once every month or two? might get 2 per month is unlucky. but the fuckass skis pe class is like literally every wednesday of this quarter of the year (which is of fucking course the longest one because fuck me apparently). every fucking week unless our teacher like straight up dies or something (she never gets sick) im gonna have this dumbass decision and probably get beaten. and this is just the pe classes. i have a lot of other bullshit at school already but i guess its not enough for me to actually want to kill myself so we need to add more huh. hate. 

also like 2 people ever will probably read this, including me, but i js feel the need to get this rant from my chest. i dont even give a shit anymore, gonna upload this to my main acc. also sorry for bad english if anything. cya l8r"

1qo43mz,Why is it that every girl I know has gotten raped?,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Just like the title says, why is it that nearly every girl or woman I know has been sexually assaulted or experienced some form of sexual abuse? Why is it that statistics like 1 in 3 women being assaulted are so common? In countries like the US, Pakistan, India, honestly, almost anywhere, this is treated as normal or at least unsurprising. Isn’t it insane that something this horrific is so normalized? And before anyone jumps in with “men get assaulted too,” I know. That’s real and serious. But that argument is constantly used to derail conversations about female victims. Right now, I’m specifically talking about women, because it happens to them at a disproportionately high rate. So my question is simple, why women specifically? I've seen some people say it's because “Women have more holes” I honestly don't know how to feel about that..? And some others say it's because women are vulnerable and more weaker. I'm here to hear your thoughts, and I'm full aware the answers are going to be disgusting because we have to look at this through a rapist's lens but I'm curious.

Edit: To the people saying I have a “crazy friend group,” that response says more about how you view victims than anything else. And to those claiming I must live in a bad area or country, I do not. This has nothing to do with location, yet many of you keep jumping to that assumption while ignoring other possibilities. The girls I am talking about were assaulted by family members, every single one of them. So saying this must be because of where I live is minimizing a reality that far too many women experience. That was literally the entire point of my post."
1qo2j11,stretch marks are normal (please read this),Serious,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk)," I need those of you who don’t know this, especially young girls and boys to read this. Right. Stretch marks  are normal and they are natural. A lot of women have them. You can’t get rid of them once they have formed. Now, what happens is when you are growing rapidly in pregnancy and sometimes in puberty, as your breast and your bottom and your thighs grow, or if you suddenly put on a lot of weight, the structures of your skin can’t keep up with the weight gain.

And they tear. And when they first happen, they’re purple because there’s bleeding where the skin has torn and stretched. Do it with a piece of paper. Pull a piece of paper very slowly and you’ll see, when you look at it, you can see the shreds of the skin hanging on in there. You can’t get rid of them. They are normal. They are absolutely natural and they are fine.

Those silvery marks are what has happened when they have healed, basically. You can’t stitch your flesh back together with a cream or a machine. The only use that a cream or something might be is when that is happening, as in before the skin has torn. If you are coming into puberty or you’re putting on weight a bit, use the cream to massage the skin to try and help the blood flow. Under the skin might help reduce them.

And with time, they will fade and they will just become silvery lines. But they won’t go away. There’s nothing wrong with them. They’re completely normal. Loads of women have them. Don’t be ashamed of them. And if somebody tries to tell you they’re ugly, personally, I think punching them on the nose would be a very good response.

Don’t let people tell you that your normal, healthy body is ugly for being a normal, healthy body. Please remember when you look at images online, they are filtered. They are photoshopped. These things exist. Don’t make yourself ill trying to become something that’s not real."

●increased sexual assault rate


-Modern research suggests that high consumption of pornography, especially content featuring violence or degradation, can contribute to sexual assault through a process called ""sexual scripting."" By repeatedly viewing scenes where consent is ignored or where aggression is rewarded with pleasure, some individuals. particularly those already predisposed to aggression, become desensitized to violence and begin to normalize the idea of sexual dominance. This often leads to the adoption of ""rape myths,"" such as the false belief that victims ""actually enjoy"" the assault or that ""no"" is just a part of a game. across multiple countries have shown a significant correlation between frequent pornography use and an increased likelihood of committing both verbal and physical sexual aggression, as the media acts as a blueprint that replaces empathy with a desire for control.


●pedophiles rate 
 

- Even legal pornography can contribute to child abuse by changing how viewers perceive children and young people.
​Sexualization of ""Youthfulness"": Many mainstream porn sites use tags or themes that sexualize ""youthful"" features (school uniforms or ""teen"" categories). Experts warn this blurs the lines and can ""prime"" an individual with pedophilic tendencies to view children as sexual objects.
​Normalizing Abuse: Frequent exposure to aggressive or non-consensual themes in adult porn can lead a person to believe that children, who are the most vulnerable. are also ""available"" for such acts.


- Normalization of the Taboo: Incest-themed content is currently one of the fastest-growing and most-searched categories on mainstream sites. By making ""daddy-daughter"" or ""step-parent"" scenarios common and accessible, the industry effectively lowers the ""disgust response"" that normally protects family units. For an individual already struggling with low empathy or predatory tendencies, this content acts as a ""green light,"" suggesting that such desires are common.


- ​The ""Blueprint"" for Grooming: Trusted sources, including Professor Clare McGlynn (2025), highlight that these videos often replicate the exact justifications used by real-life abusers, using phrases like ""our little secret"" or ""daddy's girl."" Perpetrators have been found to use these videos as grooming tools, showing them to children to ""prove"" that sexual behavior within a family is normal, expected, or ""just a game."""

The panic started hitting—that specific feeling in your chest when you know you wasted a gift.

I finally got so annoyed with myself that I decided to literally gaslight my own brain.

I opened my schedule app (I use Athly for the season, but whatever calendar you use works) and I blocked out a ""Fake Practice"" from 4 PM to 6 PM. I literally needed to see the visual block on my screen to trick my panic response into turning on.

It sounds stupid to schedule a practice that doesn't exist, but as soon as I saw the ""2 hours until Practice"" countdown, I actually started my homework. I guess I just can't function without the fear of running out of time?

Does anyone else have to mentally trick themselves to get work done on days off, or am I just cooked?"
1qnjgvk,Am I immature?,Advice,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Im 16, I have ASD, MDD, and PTSD (this is relevant information) I go to an alternative school and im planning to go back to my district school next year so I can have a normal and free senior year. My mother doesn't want me to go back, she told me she doesn't think I should go back to school with ""normal"" teens because I don't have the maturity of a ""normal"" 16 year old because I don't have a job and I don't want a license. I never thought I was immature, I don't start fights, I'm pretty social, I try to be kind to everyone, and I stay in my lane, but my mom seems to think otherwise. Am I immature? And if yes, how can I be more mature?"
1qni8ww,Help me out,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So I went to a concert a few weeks ago and randomly ran into a girl I knew of in high school. We weren’t friends back then, just familiar faces, but we ended up talking and actually hitting it off way more than I expected.

One thing led to another, we went to a bar after the concert, then eventually back to my dorm. She stayed the night, everything was great, no weirdness at all. The next morning I walked her back to her dorm, we talked a bunch, and for the entire week after that we were texting pretty consistently. It felt easy and normal, like something might actually be there.

Fast forward to this past weekend.

I go out to a bar with my friends. She’s out too, but with her own friend group. At some point one of her friends leaves, and later on she and the remaining friends end up at the same bar I’m at.

Here’s where things go downhill.

I’m a college kid at a bar, so yeah—I’m wasted. When she shows up everything seems normal at first. We’re talking, laughing, nothing feels off. Then at some point I accidentally knock her drink out of her hand.

I genuinely don’t remember every detail, but I think that was the moment things shifted.

She asks me to get her another drink, so I go to the bar. On the way back I realize I need to use the bathroom. By the time I come out, she had already texted me saying they left.

Since then… basically nothing.

She hasn’t really been texting me, and I didn’t want to push it, so I gave her space. After a few days I reached out to apologize for the other night, and she replied with:

“No everything’s perfectly fine I swear!”

And that was it.

No follow-up, no conversation, no return to how things were before.

Now I’m just sitting here wondering if I fumbled something that was actually going well, or if I’m overthinking it and it just naturally fizzled. I can’t tell if the drink thing embarrassed her, annoyed her, or if she just lost interest and doesn’t want to say it outright.

So yeah. That’s where I’m at.

Did I mess this up, or is this just how college situationships end?"
1qn9avx,A Scary story for y'all 👻 Reader's Discretion is advised.,Social,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"My father worked at a place for more than 30 years. I understand why he stayed there it was a peaceful place. Greenery all around, and the people were helpful and cheerful.

We lived in a government apartment with two floors. We lived on the lower floor. Above us lived a woman she was around 35–40 years old. She worked in the same company as my father.

She had a mental illness. I don’t know exactly what it was something like delusional disorder or schizophrenia. She wasn’t unintelligent. You could talk to her normally, she worked normally; she just had one issue she talked to herself. Not full conversations, more like murmuring.

One day, she didn’t leave her apartment for work. Her scooty was still there, but she wasn’t. We assumed she had gone to visit her parents. That wasn’t unusual—she did that often. But usually, she parked her scooty in the company parking. This time, she hadn’t. We didn’t think much of it.

After that, she started appearing in our dreams but never normally. She was either crying, silently staring into the distance (which was strange because she was rarely quiet), or lying on a hospital bed not dead, not speaking, not injured just lying there.

One day, a man came to our house. He looked familiar; we knew he worked in the same company. He looked shaken scared, concerned, maybe guilty. He asked us, “Aapne Sherya ko dekha hai?”(Have you seen Sherya) We said no. He replied, “Kaafi dino se office nahi aayi hai. Call bhi nahi kiya. Pata nahi kya hua.”(She isn't coming to the office from a couple of days. She didn't call either. We don't know what happened)

We immediately felt that something was very wrong. We called her parents right away. That man tried to stop us, but we did it anyway. Her parents said, “Yahan toh nahi aayi hai woh.” (She didn't come here)

Our hearts sank.

We told them everything. They started panicking too. The man left, but his face showed guilt, fear, and concern.

Two days later, her parents came and started banging on the door. It turned out the apartment wasn’t locked from the outside, but from the inside. They broke the door open and found Sherya lying lifeless on her bed. She had taken her own life.

Later, it was discovered that the same man who came to our house had sexually assaulted her and taken all her money. He confessed because he got scared

1qn6z2z,My father keeps stopping me from talking to cute attractive boys,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"My father’s behavior toward me changes depending on what kind of boy I talk to, and it’s really confusing and stressful for me.

When it’s my father’s friend’s son and a boy he thinks is unattractive like maybe fat or with specs and short and pimples , he smiles and asks why I don’t talk to them or why i go out and leave the house before they come over. He tells me that his friend and friend's son are very nice and talkative so i should meet them.  He says why is your behavior like this. 

But when the boy is good looking or a boy from my school that I find cute, my father becomes angry and stressed. He asks many questions, watches me and the boy closely. 

One time he saw me talking to a cute boy from my school, and his eyes were wide open like he was shocked. He kept staring at the boy and then at me, not in a happy way. 

I obey my father ever since i was small and si he has never directly or angrily forbidden me from talking to boys the way some parents do. Instead, he will will nervously while looking at me say “Nowadays you talk to boys, huh”. I feel that these comments are not general, but are specifically about one situation where I spoke to a boy from my school who he seemed uncomfortable with. Even though he doesn’t openly stop me, the way he says these things makes me feel nervous and unsure of myself.


His anger and reactions make me very nervous and uncomfortable, and I don’t understand why he treats the situation so differently depending on how the boy looks. 

Is this normal behavior for a parent? How should I deal with this?"
1qn23mg,Childhood traumas part 1,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"a few years ago, when I was 12 or 13, I was forced to go camping with my grandparents for the summer break before going back to school. About a month after arriving, I was taking a shower (like a normal human being), and my grandma walked in. My cousin was in a different shower, but anyway, my Grandma walked in the bathroom I was in, trying to ""give me shampoo"" when I was clearly old enough to do it myself, but after 3 minutes of my yelling at her. to get out, she opened the fucking curtains and looked right at me, I started screaming at her  to get out, but all she said was ""Stop screaming, I've seen. you naked way more than you've seen yourself naked, "" and I haven't seen this woman in 4 years, so I had no idea what she meant.... the next day, my mom came for a visit, I told her what had happened, and she took me home. ever since that day, I've covered up my body with baggy clothes, never showing a lot of skin... only every my hands and face..

this shit is not made up for attention, I'm not that type of person."
1qn3f3g,"A story of ""a loser guy""",Advice,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"When I was 15 years old, I graduated from middle school with a 95-degree average. I then started studying English because, well, besides the fact that I got a high score on the exam, that doesn't make me much different from most people out there who also pass English exams but yet still aren't that good at it. I dedicated 5 months to learning English, and I started to speak well and listen well. My mindset changed a lot. People around me no longer made sense to me. It wasn't that I got great at English—it was that I discovered I can learn and master anything I want. School and society were just dragging me to believe that being great at something isn't accomplished by anyone and you have to be gifted and blah blah. Well no, I wasn't even able to spell ""they"" in English, and now I'm fluent. A native speaker can't distinguish whether I'm a foreigner or just native. Believe me, I really don't think this is special. There are tons of people out there who mastered it and became good at it, but the only thing that it showed me is that I could learn and become whatever I want.

School stopped me from really contributing to myself and knowing myself. I want to learn and expand. School wants time. There is no time. Skills need time. I don't like school. School no longer gives me pleasure. Family upset. Family forces me to do it. I fake my studying by studying what I want. Anxiety all over. I can't remember how many days my mouse cursor was just ready to switch to the tab where it shows I'm studying. I can't remember how many days my mom scrolled on me and my dad as well.

I studied Chinese afterwards. I got really good at pinyin, and my writing was really good. But school grades already got to my parents. Dad mad. Dad takes all the notes that are all over my room about Chinese and the characters I drew. I got in my room seeing them all on the floor. It hurt me. Besides that, he forced me to study for a subject while seeing my notes around. I didn't give up. I can't study Chinese because languages like these require sound-making and writing characters that are obviously different from most languages that would look like they're my subject's languages, so I started programming.

I started while things were getting that much worse. In fact, it's that thing that also gets me into depression and stress, which leads me to bad habits like scrolling. The last year of high school is already here, and I have to study in summer. I wanted this to end, so I just studied for 2 weeks, and I realized that this is really not what should happen. It's a wrong decision. I should get back to programming. I kept with programming, but regarding the times that just felt so depressing because my family notices that I don't study but they're just not sure, so they just keep investigating to know if I'm really studying.

Before school starts, within a month, I told my mom that I don't want to do this—I want to do my stuff. She refused. The next day, crying and screaming. Believe me, that thing feels worse than feeling like a loser. Then I went out the next day with my friend and spent a few hours, and when I got back, I found them gone looking for me, going to the police station and so on. I still remember how my dad looked when he got home and how my mom kept crying more, just like if they assumed that it's the death of their real son and the child they have now is completely different—worse than a loser. I couldn't handle that feeling again. I wanted this to end.

So here is my first ever regretted decision that was ever made. It cost me almost a year of my life. I studied for school, and I really did, but hey, I got the worst system on the planet, so not starting in summer—well, then you have to pay the incoming consequences. Study for 12 hours and then get 30 or 40 or just barely 50 because you didn't start in summer. You have to get this. Nothing changed. Still the same thing happening.

I remember once I studied for an exam 10 hours. Besides that, I was preparing for a month before that for this exam and studying 8 hours a day. And when I got into the exam, a mediocre teacher didn't give the whole time for us, so I only completed two questions out of four. And I got back just like if I didn't do anything. I got home, and I cried for the first time in years after becoming 17, and my mom didn't care. She just said, ""Don't worry,"" as if she's sending a text. And it kept going.

And when the exams of the second semester were about to be done, one exam was just left, but yet my whole semester grades are just so bad. So I just didn't want to go to the exam, and my mom, as always, kept screaming and yelling. And at that time, I believe that my whole body lost control over itself. It's just like someone else came out of it to do this to me, just like my anxiety and everything got out and smashed me to the point where I wished my existence was a dream. Yeah, I smashed myself into the wall, but believe me, that thing was not even like I was in control. I went to the exam anyway, but just silent. It felt weird, just like there was nothing happening and time wasn't there.

But then three months were only left for the exam. I guess that's where the question of where my skills got back. It didn't get better, so why continue? It was just like when I was studying for myself. Then I got back. I started Indonesian as well. I started 3D and normally just sticking with programming, but this time things are different. I switched to Linux and also started to really understand more and enjoy the process more.

I didn't go to the final exams because, well, I will fail anyway. Also, yeah, well, my parents also got mad about it too, but the problem is that I wasn't planning to do another year. I was planning to work and continue my learning and then start out my first shop. But they forced me again to continue it. My brain already lost the enjoyment of school. My brain no longer produces dopamine for that. And this time I started to not really care—not really care whether my mom cried or my dad yelled or people thought of me as cool or just a loser. I think I just got used to all of that, and it's no longer there.

However, today is January 26, 2026, and I'm still really passionate about continuing to study my cybersecurity and working journey. Well yeah, I got a job that is linked to my computer skills. However, my mom eventually now believes that there is a devil inside and magic or some of that nonsense. I just want this to be out there so that future me would be able to visit it back again"

\# General rules

\- Use the best grammar you can possibly do. Avoid one liners and spelling mistakes. 

\- Use a VPN (I personally use PrivadoVPN with OpenVPN scramble protocol on my laptop) for anything you can

\# TikTok and Twitter

Use it ONLY on Web with a VPN until the ban comes through; then, it shouldn’t kick you off for using your native IP. 

\# Reddit

View NSFW subs. No need to scroll them, just sit on the title page. Influences it GREATLY. 

Make a NSFW post. Just mark it as it. On your own subreddit, if need be. No need to actually have anything NSFW. Just post a normal image marked as NSFW. 

\# Tumblr

I don’t have anything for this. I just used my dad’s gun license, since I started using it after the ban. 

\# YouTube 

Good grammar is key. 

Don’t post videos of your face, especially if you have a baby face. This nearly got me flagged. 

\# Snapchat

1qm4u50,Anyone else’s friends act like you can’t be stressed if your grades are high?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Hey guys! So me and my friends have been a group since kindergarten. It’s me (I’m using fake names): Janelle, Brittney, Vanessa, and Lia. Like I said, we’ve been good friends for a long time and I love them, but ever since grade 9 they give me looks when I talk about school worries.

For context, my friends have pretty good grades, like 70–80s, but mine are generally higher. For example, I got a 98 in math. You know how friends share their worries? We all complain about tests and stuff  basic teenager things  and we have a lot of the same classes. But as soon as I open my mouth, they all roll their eyes and say things like, “Why are you worrying?” or “You always get good grades, you have nothing to worry about.” And it hurts.

I feel like I can’t even share my problems with them. Getting high grades is good, but it can be hard to maintain them and it’s stressful. It also hurts that they react like that because I feel like I can’t even share my achievements with them either. It’s weird because other than this, we’re all good and there aren’t really any other problems between us. I understand that I might be ""bragging"" but I don't I understand I might upsetting them so I avoid and watch my tone when telling the how I feel.

1qm3n72,Weird Mental Health Rant,Rant,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"So for several years now, I was basically just really depressed. It was completely destroying me mentally and no one knew anything was wrong. It got to the point to where I was fantasizing about killing myself. There was no chance of it ever happening, I was just longing for it.

After a while I told a friend of mine over discord. He was supportive and nice and tried to help.

And after telling him it just kinda stopped. I figured that would happen. I figured it would last maybe a week or two before continuing.

But it's been over a month and a half now. And it's still stopped. And now im just confused.

I know this sounds like me saying ""breaking news: man is suffering from too much success"", but this shit's weird.

You're telling me that my depression was so much of a little bitch, that all it takes is a someone saying ill be okay for it to fuck off.

Is it gonna come back? It'll probably come back. Unless it wont? Im just confused now. This isnt supposed to happen. Its been so long since ive felt normal that I have no idea whats going on.

1qlw6nw,Please tell me someone else agrees with me (image unrelated) (rant),Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"So my sister has been (basically) insulting my friends straight to my face, specifically my best friend.

Every time they (my best friend) come over, they will try to talk to my sister to try to make a good impression. My sister and my friend don’t have much (if anything) in common; my friend is very intentional when talking to people where as my sister is more quiet and prefers people who are also like that, which means she gets a little uncomfortable when talking to my friend. So I get her not really wanting to be around them, but what makes me upset is that any time they come up in a conversation with my sister, my sister will find I way to insult them or talk bad about them.

For example, last night my sister said “theater kids can’t pick up on sarcasm” because I can’t and I’m a theater kid. She quickly retracted that and said “well, no, some can.” And I said “like who? You don’t know many theater kids.” And she goes, “well, not (best friend’s name). They don’t pick up on it.”

She didn’t just say it as “oh, they don’t pick up on it, haha.” No, she was glaring and said it in a tone of annoyance.

This was a smaller thing, obviously, but any time this friend specifically comes over, when they leave, my sister will go on an annoyed/frustrated rant of how she thinks they are loud and obnoxious. They aren’t in the slightest.

What I think my sister is trying to say is that when my friend tries to talk to her, it makes her slightly uncomfortable, but that’s never how it comes off; she doesn’t just go quiet or just slink away, she’ll actively glare at my friend while they’re talking and cross her arms.

My sister also just constantly gives off this tone of superiority; every time I make a new friend and try to tell her about them, she’ll sigh and groan and cut me off, but any time it’s about *her* friends, if I so much as look away or do my own thing while she’s talking, she’ll sigh and go “whatever, never mind.” Basically saying “you clearly don’t care anyway.”

Her friend are apparently more important; more normal and just “better.”

I asked her one time how she’d feel if I started talking about her friends the way she talks about mine, if I started saying stuff like “ugh, your friends are always talking to me” “why is (her friend’s name) always over?” “Your friends are so loud.” How she’d feel.

She responds with “but they’d never do that. And they aren’t annoying.”

I asked again: “but what if I just started insulting your friends?”

Her response: “I wouldn’t care.”

I just went “well I CARE. THEY ARE MY FRIEND AND I CARE ABOUT THEM.” As my sister sits there, holding back giggles as she looks at me like I’m crazy for CARING ABOUT MY FRIENDS.

She does this *all. The. Time.* It’s not a one time thing or rare, it’s incredibly common and I’m getting sick of it.

I asked my mom to talk to her about it and she did. I asked her what my sister said and she goes “nothing, what did you expect her to say?”

I responded with “‘sorry’ maybe?”

“Well I can’t force her to say that.”

My sister is acting like a baby that doesn’t understand basic human decency, and she honestly doesn’t.

She’s awful to everyone that isn’t her friend except my older brother.

She insults with my older brother behind my back, she insults me and my younger brother TO OUR FACES, and then gets confused when we get upset.

I genuinely don’t think she understands basic human empathy. I’ve never heard her apologize unless she was told to, never seen her cry or feel bad about something she did or said, nothing. And she’s never told off.

The only time I’ve seen her been told off is when I snapped at her and screamed that I was sick of her and my older brother insulting me and grabbed her by her shoulders and shook her.

I went a little too far, but I felt bad and apologized after my mom came it.

Basically she said that she and my brother needed to stop being “absolute assholes” to me and my younger brother (and that I shouldn’t have screamed at her).

Y’know what she did? Nothing.

No apology, no look of shame, nothing. Just giggles and grins at my brother as I was told off. And they didn’t stop. They still gossip about me and my younger brother and I’m getting sick of it.

But what am I supposed to do? My mom barely does anything about it, my sister isn’t gonna stop, neither is my brother.

TL;DR: my sister insults me and my friends with my brother and doesn’t see the issue. My parents barely do anything about it. What am I supposed to do?"

my mom is a bitch.

“whoa don’t say that about her she gave birth to you”

man fvck that.

where do i even start

so for a couple of months my mom has been gettin on my nerves a lot for various reasons i can’t even list bc i don’t get the point in holding on to specific things.

wait that’s a lie it’s been more than a couple of months.

first noticed the triggering effect back in high school and i was in a boarding school so that made me actually want to go back to school instead of staying at home.

recent incidents;

Story 1?

so like two weeks ago, i was a little vexed but even less than usual due to my mother’s behaviour. i’m sorry im not giving the details so you understand but i really can’t remember the specifics.

but usually by the next day i cool off.

this particular day i told her i wanted to call my dad who i don’t live with the day before to discuss my going to university and the monthly payment of my braces.

no response

in a previous message i even told her about accommodation i found close to the university no response.

fine

now on this day i went to the dentist for the braces appointment and called my dad to tell him about the 3k monthly payment.

my father likes to be preinformed and having lived with him for over ten years prior, my mother and i are aware but to call him on the day to tell him i needed him to wire 3k was not something he took lightly since he obviously hadn’t set money aside for that yet, so it took a bit of a while for him to put his assets together and tweak his budget.

so i had to sit there and take the scolding over the phone in the reception about not calling the day before because of my father.

no problem ig.

now after the appointment im a bit agitated myself because all this could’ve been avoided if she just let me call him the day before.

but no worries.

since i was still agitated when she called like two hours after the appointment i didn’t pick.

then i did the same thing she’s been doing the whole month and left her messages on read.

now it becomes a big deal that im doing it and she calls her friend to come talk to me.

normally, id just sleep it off and be fine the next day and i told them that and that i probably wouldn’t be able to control my emotions but they pressed on and when i started talking about my concerns they just kept shutting me off telling me im being very selfish with everything i was saying.

then my mother made a point about the call saying she called to check whether i got to the dentist in the first place and i called her out saying that was a plain lie, (remember first when i mentioned she called two hours after the time of the appointment) and they said i should bring my phone to show the call log as proof and when i did that and they saw they just seized my phone.

now earlier in the conversation with them she mentioned how she left a phone for me to call my dad with on her bed in her room because he didn’t know i bought my own phone with the money i should’ve used to acquire provisions and take care of myself in school. but she locked the phone and when i asked the password which i forgot to mention earlier she left me on read again.

so she ended up putting my phone which i bought with my own money (sorry abt the repetition im jxt vexing recalling it) at the same place so i just went for it because i still needed it for my school registration and stuff.

then later i fell asleep and her and her friend stormed my room scattering the things which woke me up while lookin for the phone and eventually found it on the floor by my bedside (not hidden away mind you)

then the next day idk i jxt did whatever came to mind which ik was very wrong of me and took her phone and some hidden away money and left the house after dropping my sister off at school.

spent the whole day away and came back.

not a single exchange the whole week then she called up my father forcing me to ask for money and things for university.

i did and that day was a friday mind you im supposed to go to school on sunday and im now informing him impromptu again.

he got angry and said he didn’t hv the funds for that especially with my recent behaviour of the impromptu calls which he’s heavily against.

vibe

now some time passes and i cool off and apologise to my mother for getting aggravated at having a talk i didn’t want to and for leaving the house.

she doesn’t mind me.

waits till the day before i have to register my courses at university before she’s all like so im glad you finally came to apologise and had this whole talk and whatever. wasn’t falling for it bc ik she didn’t hv a choice and that i needed the phone for some steps in the course registration.

Story 2;

she’s been trying to stuff down the concept of me going to the university which she works at for a long time now even though i explicitly told her i didnt want to and even made me register under her email address and phone number so she had full access to other schools.

now when the admissions come in i see that the course i chose for the other university had changed and when i told her she just shrugged it off and had me talk to a whole bunch of her coworkers about how wonderful the university she works at is.

i decided to enroll for the other university mainly because of the distance cause i wanted to be as far away from her as possible and cause most of my friends were there.

Story 3?

now this one happened just today and this whole week id only eaten once earlier in the week because there’s no food in the house and my mother won’t let me buy some or buy some herself cause she’s not in the house so it’s not her problem.

yesterday my grandma came over with some food but i was extremely tired after more rounds at course registration and stuff so i slept through supper.

now she said she won’t let me eat breakfast till i clean my bathroom.

my head was hurting and stuff so i said alright let me at least get my medication and she said no.

so i finished cleaning up and called her but was feeling drowsy afterwards so fell asleep.

my grandma woke me up worried since she hadn’t seen me eat since she came and called me down to eat.

now when i prepared the food my mom came downstairs to say no i shouldn’t eat the food i just prepared i should eat some fish stew knowing i hate fish and am allergic to some species and somehow almost always end up choking on a bone lmao.

this is all that has come to mind rn hopefully will be able to recall more and note down later.

i need help."
1qlvof0,Why can’t I make friends?,Social,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Im 17 and a senior in hs and I’ve hard such a hard time making friends, I fear this may become worst in college. I don’t consider myself to be super shy, I always talk to people in class and get to know them. However, it is Damm near imposible to have a friendship with anyone. It doesn’t matter how hard I try talk to people the conversation always ends up being awkward. Through my 4 years of hs I’ve seated alone in lunch everyday, i was extremely embarrassed during freshman year to the point I would hide in the library. But since I got used to it and now I just sit by myself anywhere. I don’t understand WHY I can’t make friends. I’m always nice to people, I consider myself relatively good looking and very clean. I even started to think it could be because I’m gay and Latino? But I see other gay guys in my school with so many girlfriends. I’m so exhausted, I’ve tried EVERYTHING. I only have one friend that I knew from middle school but we’ve become distant overtime. Also I go to a pretty large school around 3.5k students and it’s extremely diverse. I’ve come to the conclusion that maybe I’m just a boring and awkward person. I thought that when I came out of the closet I would be able to make friends with girls easily but it has not been the case whatsoever, if anything girls look at me like a weirdo when I even say hi to them. And with boys it’s even worse they straight up look at me with disgust. Mind you I’m not a feminine dude either I’m very normal looking. I leave hs in about 4 months and I feel like I missed out on everything. I’ve never hanged out with friends, never been to a party or sleep over, never been to any sort of social event. One time I went to a football game by myself and it was so depressing to see everyone enjoying their best years and me standing by myself in misery. At this point I’ve given up on making friends in HS. Everybody says it’s harder to make friends in college so I just know my college years are about to be very lonely. Does anyone have any tips? Like I really don’t know what else to do, I’ve joined clubs and been extremely involved in school but even then nothing but small talk and weird looks. I would really appreciate any feedback! Please don’t be mean I’m already doing through so much."

The question “How do I get a girlfriend?” has appeared on r/teenagers with such frequency that it may soon be classified as a recurring natural disaster. This essay seeks to compile existing research, anecdotal evidence, Reddit comments, and pure delusion in order to establish a definitive answer. Through extensive observation (watching couples at the mall) and rigorous experimentation (texting “hey” and waiting), this paper concludes that getting a girlfriend is not a skill issue, but a complex interaction of confidence, hygiene, timing, and luck.

**How to Get a Girlfriend: A Multidisciplinary Academic Analysis**  


# Teacher Comment: Interesting topic choice. Let’s see where this goes.

Since the dawn of civilization, humanity has pursued many great questions: What is the meaning of life? Are we alone in the universe? Why did she reply “lol” instead of “lmao”? Among these, one question has appeared with alarming consistency on the subreddit r/teenagers: How do I get a girlfriend? This question is rarely asked calmly. It is typically posted late at night, often after viewing romantic content online, and usually by someone who believes they are fundamentally unlovable. This essay seeks to examine this phenomenon using academic structure, mixed citation styles, and absolutely zero shame.

To understand how one might acquire a girlfriend, one must first define what a girlfriend actually is. According to Urban Dictionary (2009), a girlfriend is “someone who loves you and steals your hoodies.” Sociological observation further confirms that girlfriends exist, as they are frequently observed in public holding hands with individuals described by witnesses as “mid,” “not even funny,” or “literally just a guy.” This directly contradicts the popular belief that romantic success is reserved exclusively for flawless individuals (Smith et al., 2022).



# Teacher Comment: Good use of anecdotal evidence. Be careful not to generalize too much.

One of the most significant obstacles to romantic success is a condition referred to in this paper as Maidenless Energy. This condition manifests when an individual desires a girlfriend so intensely that it alters their behavior in noticeable and unfortunate ways. Symptoms include replying to messages instantly, apologizing unnecessarily, rereading conversations for hidden meaning, and developing strong emotional attachment after minimal interaction. Research indicates that women are capable of detecting this energy immediately through mechanisms not yet understood by science but universally acknowledged to exist (Trust Me Bro, 2023).

Physical appearance is often cited as the primary reason for romantic failure. Many teenagers claim they are too unattractive, too short, or “genetically cooked.” However, observational studies conducted in malls, schools, and grocery stores demonstrate that men shaped like poorly assembled furniture are frequently in relationships. This suggests that appearance alone is not the determining factor. Hygiene, posture, clothing that fits, and basic social competence have been shown to increase attractiveness more significantly than facial symmetry (Shower et al., 2024).



# Teacher Comment: Excellent real-world observation. Consider showering as a variable.

Confidence is another commonly misunderstood concept. Popular media often portrays confidence as dominance, loudness, or podcast ownership. However, psychological research suggests that true confidence is quiet and does not require announcement. Individuals who verbally identify themselves as confident tend to exhibit less of it (Vibes Institute, 2020). Genuine confidence includes comfort with rejection, emotional regulation, and the ability to function without constant validation.

Communication with women remains a major challenge for many. This difficulty arises largely from the misconception that women are puzzles to be solved or achievements to be unlocked. This approach has been shown to fail consistently. Women are people, and speaking to them as such—without strategy, performance, or false interest in hiking—significantly improves social outcomes (Talking Normally Journal, 2021).



# Teacher Comment: Strong thesis here. Maybe bold it next time.

Texting represents a critical and dangerous stage in modern romantic interaction. A delayed reply often results in panic, overthinking, and the construction of elaborate narratives involving disinterest or betrayal. However, studies show that the most common explanations for delayed responses are that the individual is busy, asleep, or watching TikTok (Everyone et al., 2015–Present). Triple texting, meanwhile, has been linked to severe loss of dignity and attraction (Harvard University, probably).

Dating apps exacerbate these issues by transforming romance into a confidence-destroying numbers game. Ghosting, unmatching, and being ignored are not personal failures but shared experiences across the user base. Temporary deletion of these apps followed by staring at the ceiling has been documented as a common coping mechanism (Reddit User u/\[deleted\], 2017).

When a date does occur, many individuals mistakenly treat it as a job interview. They list accomplishments, future goals, and opinions nobody asked for. The purpose of a first date is simply to determine whether two people enjoy each other’s company. Experts strongly discourage explaining cryptocurrency or planning marriage during the appetizer (Common Sense Journal, 2021).



# Teacher Comment: Please stop talking about crypto.

Emotional intelligence is ultimately unavoidable. This includes expressing feelings appropriately, listening, and not unloading one’s entire trauma history in a single conversation. Vulnerability has been shown to increase emotional connection, while oversharing tends to produce concern (Boundaries Monthly, 2023).

In conclusion, there is no guaranteed formula for getting a girlfriend. Romantic success depends on timing, compatibility, effort, and luck. The healthiest approach is to focus on becoming a functional and emotionally stable individual and allowing relationships to form naturally. If this does not happen immediately, life continues. High school ends. You are not cooked. Additionally, statistical analysis suggests that the individual reading this essay is likely still single, which is unfortunate but objectively funny.



# Teacher Comment: Strong conclusion. See me after class.

Days turned into weeks, then a cautious month. The staring stopped. No more anonymous accounts. No notes in lockers. Kavya faded into the background at school—different classes, different lunch spots, head always down when paths crossed. Ananya let herself breathe. She started texting Riya more. Study sessions turned into coffee runs, shared playlists, quiet laughs over bad exam memes. It felt safe. Normal. Like maybe the nightmare was finally over.

Then one Friday evening, Ananya's phone lit up with a message from Riya.

**Riya:** Hey, I'm kinda bored this weekend. Parents are away again till Sunday. Wanna come over for a sleepover? Just us, movies, junk food. No pressure. 🫶

Ananya stared at the screen. Riya had never invited her over before—not like this. Her apartment was small, one-bedroom, always smelled faintly of coffee and rain from the balcony plants. It felt intimate. Exciting.

She typed back quickly.

**Ananya:** Yeah, I'd love that. What time?

**Riya:** 8? Bring your fave snacks. Door's open, just come in.

Ananya smiled. Packed an overnight bag—pajamas, charger, the book they'd been talking about swapping. Told Priya she'd be out till Sunday morning. Priya raised an eyebrow but only said, ""Text me when you get there. And if anything feels off.""

The building was quiet when Ananya arrived. She knocked once, then pushed the door—unlocked, like promised. The living room was dim, only the kitchen light on. No TV. No music. Just silence.

""Riya?""

A soft shuffle from the bedroom hallway.

Ananya stepped inside, bag slipping from her shoulder.

Then she saw her.

Kavya.

Standing in the middle of the room, hair loose, eyes wide and glassy. In one hand, a kitchen knife—blade catching the low light. In the corner, near the wardrobe, Riya—wrists bound with what looked like electrical cord, mouth taped shut with duct tape, sitting on the floor, eyes terrified but alive. A bruise blooming on her cheek. She shook her head frantically when she saw Ananya.

Ananya's bag hit the floor.

""Kavya… what—""

Kavya stepped forward. Slow. Deliberate. The knife stayed low but pointed.

""You came,"" she whispered. Voice trembling with something like relief. ""I knew you would. If it was from her phone. You wouldn't say no to her.""

Ananya's heart slammed against her ribs. ""Let her go. Now.""

Kavya glanced at Riya, then back. ""She was nice. Too nice. Invited me over last week to 'talk things out.' Said you seemed happy now. Said maybe we could all be friends."" A small, broken laugh. ""Friends. Like I could watch you two and pretend it didn't kill me.""

She moved closer. Ananya backed up until her shoulders hit the wall.

""I waited,"" Kavya said. ""I cooled down. I tried. But every time I saw you smile at her… every time you walked past me like I didn't exist… it started again. The thoughts. The need. I couldn't stop.""

The knife rose slightly. Not threatening yet. Just there.

""I had to see you. Touch you. Make you remember.""

Ananya's voice shook. ""This isn't remembering. This is—""

Kavya lunged.

Not to stab. To grab. One hand fisted in Ananya's shirt, yanking her forward. The knife pressed flat against Ananya's side—not cutting, just a cold line of pressure. Kavya's mouth crashed onto hers—hard, desperate, tasting of salt and panic.

Ananya fought. Twisted. Pushed at Kavya's shoulders. ""Stop—Kavya, stop—""

Kavya didn't. She kissed deeper, tongue forcing in, free hand sliding under Ananya's top, palm hot against bare skin. Fingers digging into ribs. Ananya shoved harder, knee coming up—but Kavya anticipated, twisted away, used her weight to pin Ananya against the wall.

""You're mine,"" Kavya breathed against her neck. ""You were always mine. You kissed me first. You wanted this.""

Ananya's arms flailed. She clawed at Kavya's wrist—the one with the knife. Kavya hissed but didn't drop it. Instead she pressed closer, body flush, grinding hips in a sick parody of intimacy.

""I touch myself thinking about you,"" Kavya whispered, voice cracking. ""Every night. Your laugh. Your hands. The way you looked at me before you hated me. I make myself come so hard I cry. Sometimes… sometimes I hurt myself after. Pinch. Scratch. Make it bleed. Because I deserve it. For losing you. For making you hate me. Punishment. So I remember how much I need to fix it.""

Tears streamed down Kavya's face now, mixing with the kiss. She pulled back just enough to look at Ananya—eyes wild, pupils blown.

""I bleed for you,"" she said softly. ""I hurt for you. Why can't you see that? Why can't you just let me love you?""

Ananya's stomach churned. She stopped fighting for a second—went limp, played weak. Let her body sag like she was giving in.

Kavya softened instantly. The knife eased back an inch. ""See? You feel it too. You just forgot.""

Ananya's voice came out small. Broken. ""I… I was scared. Of how much I wanted you.""

Kavya's breath hitched. Hope flared. She leaned in again, softer this time. Kissed Ananya's jaw. Her throat. Hand sliding lower, fumbling at the waistband of her jeans.

""I knew it,"" Kavya murmured. ""I knew you'd come back to me.""

Ananya let one tear fall—real, but weaponized. ""Please… don't hurt Riya. She's nothing. Just… let her go. It's you and me now.""

Kavya hesitated. Looked over at Riya—curled tight, shaking. Then back to Ananya.

""You mean that?""

Ananya nodded slowly. Whispered, ""I mean it. Just… put the knife down. Please.""

Kavya's grip loosened. The blade wavered.

Ananya moved—fast. Drove her forehead into Kavya's nose. Cartilage crunched. Kavya screamed, staggered back. Knife clattered to the floor.

Ananya dove for it. Grabbed it. Backed toward Riya, blade out.

Kavya clutched her face, blood pouring between fingers. ""You… you lied…""

""Stay down,"" Ananya said. Voice steady now. ""Don't move.""

She reached behind Riya, yanked at the cord—frantic, tearing skin on her own fingers until it gave. Riya ripped the tape off her mouth, gasping.

""Phone—where's your phone?""

Riya pointed—kitchen counter.

Ananya kept the knife trained on Kavya while Riya scrambled up, dialed emergency.

Kavya slid to her knees. Blood dripping onto the carpet. Staring at Ananya like she'd been betrayed all over again.

""I loved you,"" she whispered. ""I still do. Even now.""

Ananya looked at her—really looked. Saw the obsession laid bare: the delusion that pain proved devotion, that rejection was just a test, that forcing closeness could rewrite reality. 

Kavya’s body pressed Ananya harder against the wall, hips rocking in slow, deliberate rhythm—possessive, desperate, like she could grind the rejection out of Ananya’s bones and replace it with something she could control. The knife still hovered at Ananya’s side, cold metal kissing skin through fabric. Kavya’s mouth moved wetly along Ananya’s jaw, down her throat, murmuring broken litanies between kisses.

“I’ve waited so long… you don’t know how much I’ve wanted this… just let me have you… just once…”

Ananya’s arms hung limp now. She had stopped shoving, stopped clawing. Her eyes were open but distant, fixed on a crack in the ceiling plaster. The fight had drained out of her muscles, replaced by something colder, heavier.

Kavya misinterpreted the stillness as surrender. Her free hand slid lower, fumbling at Ananya’s waistband again, breath hitching with hope.

That was when Ananya spoke.

Not in a whisper. Not pleading. Flat. Clear. Every word carved.

“I hate you.”

Kavya froze mid-motion. Hips stilled. Mouth lifted from Ananya’s neck.

Ananya kept going, voice low and steady, no tremor.

“I hate you for what you did to me at the sleepover. For making me feel disgusting for one honest moment. I hate you for the messages, the staring, the notes. For turning every safe place into a place I had to watch my back. I hate you for hurting Riya tonight. For tying her up like she was nothing. For thinking this—*this*—is love. I hate you for every night I couldn’t sleep because I was scared you’d show up again. I hate the way you look at me now, like I owe you something. I hate that I ever kissed you first. I hate that I ever trusted you. I hate you so much it feels like it’s eating me from the inside.”

Silence.

Kavya’s hand—the one without the knife—trembled against Ananya’s hip. Then fell away completely.

She pulled back just enough to see Ananya’s face.

Ananya met her eyes. No tears. No fear. Just exhausted, unblinking truth.

Kavya’s expression cracked open. Blank at first—pupils wide, mouth slack—then the tears came. Silent. Fast. Sliding down cheeks that had gone pale.

“You hate me… that much?” Her voice was barely a breath. “What… what have I become?”

She looked down at her own hand—the one still loosely holding the knife—like she was seeing it for the first time. Then at Ananya’s rumpled shirt, the red marks her fingers had left on skin. Then across the room at Riya—curled in the corner, bound, gagged, eyes huge with terror.

Kavya exhaled once. Shaky.

She stepped back.

Completely.

The knife lowered until the tip pointed at the floor.

Without a word she crossed the room to Riya.

Ananya tensed—ready to lunge, ready to scream—but Kavya didn’t raise the blade.

She knelt instead.

Set the knife on the carpet beside her—careful, deliberate, far from reach.

Fingers shaking, she reached behind Riya and worked at the knots in the electrical cord. Pulled them loose. Then reached up and gently peeled the duct tape from Riya’s mouth—slow, so it wouldn’t tear skin more than it already had.

Riya gasped in air. Didn’t scream. Just stared.

Kavya stood.

Backed away until she was standing opposite them—Ananya still against the wall, Riya scrambling up on unsteady legs and running straight to her.

Riya crashed into Ananya’s arms. Ananya held her tight, one hand in her hair, the other around her back, shielding her as much as she could.

Kavya watched.

Tears kept falling. She didn’t wipe them. Her face stayed blank—empty, like something vital had switched off inside her.

“I was wrong,” she said quietly. “Very wrong.”

Her gaze moved between them—Ananya’s protective stance, Riya’s trembling shoulders.

“I can’t imagine a world where you hate me that much.”

She looked down at the knife on the floor.

Then she bent slowly, picked it up.

Ananya’s arms tightened around Riya. “Kavya—don’t—”

But Kavya didn’t look at them again.

In one smooth, almost calm motion, she brought the blade to the side of her own neck—just under the jaw.

And drove it through.

The sound was wet. Sudden. A choked gurgle.

She pulled the knife out in the same clean arc.

Blood sprayed in a bright arc, then pulsed steadily—dark red against pale skin, soaking the front of her shirt in seconds.

She didn’t scream.

She just swayed once.

Then dropped to her knees.

Then forward onto her face.

The knife clattered beside her open hand.

Silence again.

Thick. Final.

Riya buried her face in Ananya’s shoulder, body shaking with silent sobs.

Ananya stared at the body on the floor.

At the spreading pool.

At the way Kavya’s fingers twitched once, then stilled.

She didn’t move.

Didn’t cry.

Just held Riya tighter.

Minutes passed—maybe five, maybe ten—before the sirens started in the distance.

Ananya finally looked away from the floor.

She reached for Riya’s phone on the counter with one hand—still holding her with the other.

Dialed emergency again.

When the operator answered, her voice came out flat. Mechanical.

“There’s been a stabbing. One person dead. Self-inflicted. We’re at…” She gave the address. “Hurry.”

She hung up.

Then she slid down the wall with Riya still in her arms.

They sat there—two girls clinging to each other—while the blood kept spreading slowly across the carpet.

Outside, the city kept moving.

Inside, time had stopped.

Ananya closed her eyes.

She didn’t pray.

She didn’t curse.

She just waited for the police to come and take the rest of the night away.

And somewhere in the quiet between heartbeats, she thought:

It’s over.

Not clean.

Not kind.

But over.

1ql0tdq,am i cooked (school and isolation),Advice,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"not sure how to begin this or if it's even the right sub but i'm kind of stuck here and thought it was about time i asked for help. for context: i am 16 and in junior year of high school, diagnosed with autism (specifically ""Aspergers"" even though that term's outdated now i think), ADHD, and anxiety. i suspect OCD and AvPD (avoidant personality disorder) but haven't been diagnosed for those. (also please don't think i'm trying to collect mental conditions like pokemon cards i just want to know whats wrong with me i swear  to god)  


i was always a grade A student and had been put in ""Gifted and Talented"" classes when i was in elementary school. I would regularly go until around the end of elementary, which was when i had started intentionally missing days (specifically to avoid gym class, which i'm pretty sure was because i was scared of messing up at dodgeball or something. but also the coach was pretty mean i think). it slowly got worse over time and one could blame bad parenting for that . end of sentence. because of this my parents put me in different schools for a few years because they thought that would fix the problem

  
in the midst of middle school was when the pandemic hit, and i could not do online school, like at all. i attended a few zoom meetings here and there but for the most part i also can't remember much from then

  
this is also around the time i transitioned (i'm transmasculine) (which also explains why i can't socialize with other students somewhat) (not to say that those are directly correlated but i think people avoid talking to me just because i'm visually androgynous and they don't want to be? confused? or something? I don't kno man get me outta here).

  
in 2022 i tried to begin attending a new in-person school, that of which was said to specifically be tailored to autistic/neurodivergent students. (not exactly ""special school"" i don't think. it was basically the same as like any other public school). i had counseling there but it none of the conversations i had with the counselor went into anything too deep so it wasn't very helpful. at this school, much like the rest of my school life, i didn't have many friends and just sat at the same lunch table with a group of friends that didn't include me. (obligatory reddit user no friends joke here). i left shortly after

  
in 2023 i began attending another school which most definitely IS a special school. i'm still enrolled in this one but now i'm doing it remotely, eg. they give me work to do at home which is then dropped off at the school. (which i am actually working on! very slowly! but i'm still doing it so its better than nothing!) (It's not like i sit around doing NOTHING all day either, i'm an artist and animator and composer and uh well uh umm umm well) (and i go to the mall Sometimes)

  
if i have to interact with anyone who isn't part of my Trusted Circle i always end up beating myself up over it and trying to ignore it at the same time which just exhausts me and worries the people around me . tbf it IS hard to interact with people when you like, aren't Really a Person anymore idk . (would like to clarify that i am NOT trying to be self deprecating or edgy i'm just autistic and cannot relate to anyone especially now that i've been isolating myself for like a year) . tough having to decide between ""free to act however you wish socially but still confined to a room"" and ""finally not inside my house all day but i gotta be Normal""

  
anyways most of my days are spent with no socialization other than my immediate family and my discord buddies who i love very much. i hate living like this i really do. seeing everyone else go on without me is kinda lame i think . i don't want to be trapped anymore and i am thinking about going back to public school for my senior year i gotta lock in dude.

  
i'm also worried about stuff like getting a license, job, even school stuff like enrollment or whateva etc. cause i'm transgender and haven't had my name legally changed. not mentioning the Other anxieties i have to being transgender but ya know . well

  
i know it isn't too late for me and i don't plan on giving up but it's a teensy bit scary and i just dont know what to do . if anyone has any advice let me know thank yew : 3 HELP ME

  
(Also don't ask anything about like truancy or getting fined or whateva because dawg. i dont know man i really dont. ok)"
1qkrfz9,Cat creature thing- um uhh it's- I don't really know what it is actually but it kinda looks like a cat! :D (OC),Art,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Hey there! Feel free to take a moment to read this if you want, just some metaphors and symbolisms hidden in my drawing

So the most obvious anomaly here is the sparking wires and robotics hidden beneath her skin and fur. This is a subtle way to tell a story of how she's constantly trying to be someone she's not (since she's not real but a bionic contraption), but instead breaking herself in the process and ending up even worse than if she just accepted herself to begin with.

Then there's her expression. Curiosity, strong concern, determination, and wavering anxiety are all seen on one face. Not much to explain here, these are common feelings about her life. Curiosity, wondering what life could be like if things ever got better. Concern at the fact that there's literally sparking wires inside her body, waving out and posing a threat to anything flammable nearby. Determination to keep going even when things are tough. And most of all, anxiety. Is she good enough? Are others lying? Is she doing anything right? Is she really okay? Does she need to be checked? Is she overreacting?

Most striking is her eyes. Glowing blue and pink, there's nothing normal about that. Her eyes are flashing with hallucinations and lights, blinding her with visions of lives where everything is perfect, whispering good and bad ideas in her mind, corrupting what she sees into something else. Could be schizophrenia, maybe she's just crazy. Who cares, really?


Anyway, that's all, and this drawing was NOT made to have all these hidden meanings. I like to reflect myself into my drawings sometimes, but I create them for other purposes than just that. Disclaimer: I am not going insane (I hope) and this is generally just overexaggerated manifestations of some things I find challenging in my life put onto a character to make it seem cooler.

If you've read this far, thank you so much! Have an awesome life!"
1qknisu,Homeschool sucks but its better than public,Rant,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"when I joined homeschool my only option was a program that a school 2 hours away does. so I joined it 3 months into the year and tell me WHY they already have done 79 assignments and i had to do them even tho i wasnt enrolled when they did it. I had two weeks to finish it or id get warnings and stuff. I didnt finish it until the end of the semester. im marked as a problem child even tho in public school i had straight As and nevwr git introuble. new semester, im caught up everything is good, i click submit on my last assignment. oh.my.god. instead of checking to see our progress after normal school hours (3pm) she checks it at 1. so ofc the second I submit my last assignment I get a email saying im behind and I have to go up to the school, no excuses to face consequences. it said in the email that there is no getting out of it and she will not check any emails I send her. so now my mom has to take off work to drive me at 6am to this stupid school, where im already known as the weird girl bc I cried while being told I was getting put on probation for not just running through all my assignments and trying to learn (they actually said bc I was too slow and ""clearly not trying"") not only is this trip inconveniencing my mom but its also inconvenicing me bc I have sm and I KNOW I will go nonverbal the moment I step in that school like I always do. im stressing, like im done with my work so they cant make me sit for hours trying to do it while they baby talk me. JUST BC IM QUIET DOESNT MEAN IM STUPID. my IQ is above average but that doesnt even relate to school work at all. im used to being targeted for being a good two shoes not for being the supposed bad kid who needs to go on probation. I hate how im being treated by these people. id still choose this over going to school with people who bullied me so much id go to first period then hide in the bathroom the rest of the day"
1qkj9it,"Our vice principal came in our class angrily saying "" Who all have personal phones and online friend groups here""",School,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"So one fine school morning—Thursday, to be specific (of course I was absent, because I’m apparently allergic to drama days)—absolute madness went down in our class.

It starts simple. Too simple.

A guy (let’s call him Angry Guy) goes to our class teacher saying his friend (Unlucky Guy) took his school diary the previous day… and now it’s missing. Teacher talks to both of them. Normal stuff. Boring stuff. Or so everyone thought.

Suddenly, boom—this tiny diary issue speed-runs its way to the Coordinator and then straight to the Vice Principal, eating up the first two periods like it paid rent.

After recess, the Vice Principal storms into our class in her usual fast-walk mode, already angry, and be like already done with our lives. First question:

“Who all have personal phones?”

The energy was you are all finished today. Half the class has phones, but only one guy raises his hand. Absolute bravery. Absolute miscalculation. Flexing at the wrong time, my guy 😔
She calmly (not calmly) tells him to call his parents after school. Not screaming, but scary-polite.

Then she drops the next bomb:

“Who all has online friend groups?”

At this point I’m thinking: Ma’am… it’s 2026. Its Gen Beta. You are 50. What is this question.
Me and like my three other same level crazy friends alone probably have 300+ WhatsApp groups, but obviously nobody raises their hand. Everyone’s confused because—HELLO—weren’t we talking about a school diary this morning?

Now comes the suspicious part.

Second-last period: Second language. Hindi students go to another class, Bengali students stay. Both Angry Guy and Unlucky Guy are Hindi students… but they don’t go. They stay back.

When the others return, plot twist:
👉 Both of them are gone  
👉Their bags are gone.
Unfortunate little them

Bengali students say they came, picked up their bags, and left. Just vanished. NPC behavior.

Finally, last period. Dismissal time. Our class teacher (thankfully Gen Z in spirit) says,
“Okay, tell me your doubts. You deserve the full story.”

And THANK GOD, because other teachers would’ve hit us with “It’s none of your business.”

Here’s what actually happened:

On Wednesday, Unlucky Guy took Angry Guy’s diary to write down the syllabus. He finished some subjects, not all. Angry Guy jokingly (or not so jokingly) tells him,
“Bring ₹50 tomorrow.”

Unlucky Guy thinks it’s a joke. Like any sane human would.

But later… something happens. Nobody knows exactly what Angry Guy said, but it must’ve been serious—because Angry Guy demanded ₹900 through online transaction.

Reminder:
👉 They are 12–13 years old.

And Unlucky Guy actually sent it.

Next day, Unlucky Guy’s mom sees ₹900 sent from her account. Angry Guy’s mom sees ₹900 received. Both moms panic and march straight to the Vice Principal.

Unlucky Guy was so scared that morning that he didn’t even explain properly. The main thing, though?
The money was already gone.
Whatever threat was used must’ve been huge.

So yeah… that’s why phones suddenly became the topic. That’s why the Vice Principal lost it. That’s why the two guys disappeared mid-day.

We still don’t know if they got suspended or got a TC, but one thing’s clear:

They didn’t just mess up.
They absolutely screwed .

Rest In Peace✌️🪦"

1qkf2t9,Stuck because of my age,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"TLDR: I'm 17, I get treated very bad at my job, I cannot quit or report because I'm scared of getting fired because I have financial responsibilities and it is difficult to find a good job at my age.

Hi there, I am 17 (started job at 16) and a medical assistant at a doctors office. I am currently in college and I run front desk/scribe full time from 8am-4pm M-F. Ever since I started working here my boss and coworkers have been extremely rude to me, and my boss has favored my other colleagues, and has belittled me in front of the doctors.

The first 3 months of me working here I put up with it and went above my job description and then would cry in my car on the way home. During this time i only worked 3 days a week and when Id come in the day after class nothing would be prepped for me, no appointments, no patient cards, no packets, no folders. I sucked it up and started staying an extra hour or so after everyone left to make everything for the whole week so I didn't have to worry about whether or not I was gonna have things prepped for me. When I've asked for help I've been told by everyone ""I'm not front desk"" or flat out ignored.

After I told my boss about my class schedule for the following semester *(only Monday off)* she said ""I wish you were more considerate about what \_\_\_'s class days look like"" *(Blank enrolled in college after she started working with us, she knew our busy days and told me she picked the busy days off on purpose)* and my manager started treating me even worse. So I switched my classes fully online just so I didn't have to deal with her constantly mentioning it and all she said was ""good"". After that interaction I cut down on the excessive worked and dropped my attitude down to how I was actually feeling\*.\* This has lead to her getting even more upset because I am not making things easy for everyone else\*.\* and started saying she was going to write me up for not doing it. When I first started scribing I was joking with one of the doctors and I said ""I feel like I'm too good at front to scribe full time. "" and my manager yelled from the other side of the office ""No you're not"".

My final straw was today, I was placed in the back scribing with the doctor. We have been out of folders for the past week *(shortage in our part of town i guess)*, and we finally got them in today. She asked me on my lunch to make packets, so I tried to start but we were extremely busy so I had to go back to scribing after I started prepping folders. I told the girl upfront that I sent her an email with the correct information in them because she had been making them incorrectly and I had been getting blamed for it. She said okay and when I came back out later my manager said ""well she made the packets that you didn't"" in this condescending tone that read as *""you don't ever help around here""* as if I normally don't make 30 packets at a time when we have folders. This especially irritated me and for the last 20 minutes I was there I didn't speak to anyone and I clocked out and left.

Either way, I am fed up with it. I get treated as if I am dumb, I feel as though I am worthless and I don't add value to the office but the whole place becomes a shit show when I am not there for a day. I want to report my boss somehow but I don't want to get fired until I have a different job lined up, because I have a monthly car payment. My age makes it extremely difficult to even get an interview to explain my schooling or education. What should I do?"

1qk0cya,Feeling bad for weeks and idk what to do with it,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Note cleaned by chatgpt since english aint my native

I’m just going to start typing.

I’m a 16-year-old male. I haven’t been in school since I was 11, I think. I go to a place meant to help me get a rhythm again and eventually return to school or work. I’ll call it “the location.” I go there four times a week: twice from 9–12, once from 12–15, and once from 9–15. I’ve been going there for a year now, and I’ve only missed four times if we only count the days I didn’t show up at all. I try to go no matter how I feel, even if that means going home one or two hours early.

I’m currently on citalopram at the maximum dosage. Before this, I was on aripiprazole and sertraline (Zoloft).

I’ve been feeling bad for weeks now—about six weeks, I think—and I don’t know what to do with it.

I also have thoughts. Not that I would actually do it—I don’t have the courage—but I do know how I would do it. And honestly, there’s a big part of me (maybe 60% or more) that feels like if there were a button for it, I would press it. If everyone forgot about me, probably even more. I’ve looked up methods too, and I don’t know if that was out of curiosity or something else.

I had a dream about doing it a few nights ago. Sometimes I scare myself, even though I know I wouldn’t do it. Other times I think it’s probably fine or normal. And sometimes I feel like I don’t fully grasp how serious it is.

I have a counselor, and my parents and I are looking into therapy, but the waiting times are around nine months everywhere nearby. I live in a town with about 30,000 people—not even a city.

Honestly, fuck this country sometimes (the Netherlands). I know I’m lucky to be born here and have a good quality of life, but healthcare is understaffed, underfunded, and underpaid—let alone mental healthcare.

I’ve been feeling really bad for weeks, but at the same time I feel conflicting things:

I feel like I’m not allowed to feel bad, like I’m just complaining over nothing because other people have it much worse.

I also feel like I’m faking it. I have better and worse days, and sometimes I can genuinely laugh or have a good time without feeling bad. Other times I’m laughing while still feeling bad at the same time. I laugh easily in general, which makes me feel like—especially in those moments—I’m faking it.

I don’t really have a social life. I don’t have friends in real life, except for two people at the location I go to. One lives one town over—we’ve met up once and want to do it again. The other is a guy (FTM); we clicked well. We met up in early November at my place from 1 p.m. to 11 p.m. We watched a movie, talked, scrolled through weird fetish subreddits, and ate fries. But for him, doing things outside the location is mentally too much, which I understand.

That doesn’t happen often. Online, I have a group of about five people. Sometimes one disappears for months, comes back for a while, then disappears again. I’ve known them for about five years. I’m the youngest; the oldest is 23. He understands me best—he also has autism.

Lately, I haven’t really been talking to them. I’ve been playing games alone—Skylanders, Cyberpunk, GTA Online, etc.

Other than that, I don’t really know what I do. Mostly pirating things, watching shows, gaming, or jerking off.

The next part is directly translated from a message I sent to my counselor at 3 a.m. because I needed it out of my head:

I’m kind of tired, just typing this out to get it off my chest.

But I’ve been thinking: what is life, really? You’re basically just a small cog, which from its own perspective seems infinite. And when that cog is gone or broken, the cogs around it might turn a bit less smoothly for a while, until a new one replaces it. Then the cycle continues until those cogs have also replaced the original one, and eventually the memory has completely faded.

I guess that’s it. It turned out longer than I expected. If you read all of this, thank you really.

I just need advice, tips, or anything."

1qjymr2,Reddit is so insufferable,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I've been using Reddit more recently especially in the anime community, trying to have discussions and stuff, but if you say something that even slightly differs from the hive mind you get down voted into oblivion

and don't even get me started on the comments, if you want to have a discussion over a POSSIBLE scenario that could happen in the future of the manga then people will nitpick things in the story and give them fake meaning but because they downvoted your reply to them and you didn't downvote their comment because you want to have a normal discussion then they're automatically right. if you try to make a connection between a character and how people see them IN UNIVERSE compared to how people see someone in real life they will assume you're talking about how the character is and not how they're perceived in universe despite you making it very clear, but again, because you got downvoted once the hivemind has decided that whatever you say is invalid

1r24c5a,how do you deal with friends with deeply conflicting views,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"okay so basically i have a lot of really strong beliefs. for example (what's relevant to my problem), i believe history is deeply important to everything in life. im a strong proponent of the idea that the past shapes the present and future, ""he who forgets history is doomed to repeat it"", etc etc.

  
basically i have this friend, lets call her A. A is a really nice person and shes pretty cool to hang out with, and i do genuinely like her, but shes super historically illiterate. As in, she didnt know what WW1 is type of illiterate. that usually wouldnt be a problem - like i was shocked and sure, i value history, but it's not your fault if you didnt know about something, i wouldve explained history stuff and its relevance considering it's already an interest of mine. my problem is that she just doesnt listen to me at all. today i was doing history homework next to her and i make a joke about how she didnt know what ww1 was (this was a joke she was totally fine with me making btw, she wasnt rlly upset abt it), and then that escalated into her saying that it didnt really matter because ""history isnt relevant to \[my\] daily life"" and shes ""not going to be a historian or anything"". sentiments like that piss me off. a lot. i was kinda frustrated because she just kept going ""okay sure whatever"" (in the exact condescending tone youre imagining). eventually she was just like ""well your tone is kinda condescending, i shouldnt be \[punished\] because i dont think history is important"" and i tried to explain that im not trying to condescend or punish her, just express my beliefs and my frustration that she never listened to me (we've had talks about it before but never super seriously) and she just said im condescending to her and left while i was trying to explain that im not trying to say shes stupid or something. (we were in a library btw, this wasnt like a screaming match or anything, just disagreeing)

  
i really dont want to stop being friends with her (because i know that will inevitably end up in the comments) but at the same time i cant just keep silent about stuff like that. saying things like history/literacy/etc doesnt matter is really frustrating to me (and also just like. objectively wrong.) but i dont know what else i shouldve done except for just kept my mouth shut. i feel like shit cause it feels like i mightve ruined something good because i couldnt keep my opinions to myself but at the same time i cant just keep quiet when someone i value is going on about stuff like that."
1r1vone,My father thinks that reading books or drawing are waste,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I am 16 and never had a hobby never really.
Last year I tried drawing and I did enjoy it but my father will come and tell me instead of this I should Google something useful know the country better I get discouraged.

Now I am on my phone too much and my attention span in cooked and I wanted a hobby which will be free and found book. I don't know if I will enjoy or not but I have a library near me which Is free and wanted to give it a try and I searched through Google all media to find a book I might like and found it and was excited to go and get it and when I told my father he told me why should read a book
I told him instead of being on my phone all the time it will be nice to read books on my free time and he was like nice and after 2 sec he starts saying you can read books but you should know the country better we are in Denmark now you should read about danish history and your own country history I told him ok I will.

Then he goes on and on and says books aren't that good if you are reading to get knowledge I told him I will be reading them for entertainment instead of my phone and he dont listen to me and keep saying poem is like a song books are story better then that learn history or something 


And i got sad and he told me you can still read book I am not telling you to not read it 



I am so discouraged whenever I pick something to do he always gives me a lecture that you should do this.

1r21b6s,I HAVE AN UPDATE FOR THIS,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So I managed to send out a long text (with my boyfriends help and input) basically setting boundaries again. I was told I sounded pretty respectful and assertive. This is what I sent J.

“Hey man, I just wanted to again set some boundaries with you about your behavior and how it’s been making me feel. You’ve been doing things that make it seem like you’re flirting with me to some extent (such as you saying you’ll make basketball shots for me, reiterating how you took that unexpected photo and when you grabbed my sleeve). I would also like to bring up how when \[Boyfriend’s name\] and I first started dating, your immediate response was to criticize my choice in getting into the relationship in the first place. I am mature enough to evaluate myself and to make decisions on who I want near me or not.

I also spoke to \[Boyfriend’s name\] about this and he has told me that it makes him uncomfortable as well. This behavior you show comes off as you seeming jealous and/or interested in me, despite you knowing I have a boyfriend. I would like to make one thing perfectly clear for you; I am perfectly content in my current relationship. I have never been treated better. I love my boyfriend and I am not interested in anyone else.”

—

Then a few hours later I get a very defensive reply back. J was saying things like 

“Nobody is jealous of your relationship”

“I have my own girl to worry about, all I was doing was being myself to you”

and “Imma leave you alone so stop accusing me of things when all I was trying to do was to be a friend and make you feel seen…”

He also said “clearly I keep going past your boundaries to the point you’re making \[Boyfriend’s name\] worried for no reason” ….BRO IS TRYING TO MAKE ME LOOK LIKE IM OVERREACTING😭😭 "
1r29jbw,I hate music,Rant,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"so I’m in a band I like it, but holy shit writing music expecially with our bassist/frontman is so fucking annoying

we can’t agree on basically anything because he has such a fucking weird music taste where he likes some songs but still dislikes most other songs in that same genre? and like he thinks rhythm is much more important than melody which is exactly the other way around than how I think and we just always agrue when in the process of making music :&lt;

also he keeps insisting on downtuning the guitars and I just wanna stick to a couple tunings so that we could actually play the songs live without having to change tunings or guitars every fucking song 😭

and for context, I’m the drummer but so far I’ve also been the one to write guitar parts but I genuinely wanna quit playing guitar in the band because it just drives me mad trying to argue with this guy.

we’re pretty good friends otherwise but omg making music with him fucking sucks 😭"
1r186w3,My boyfriend is abusing me 18F 19M,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So it started with just a slap..he thought i was cheating on him (I wasn’t) and he slapped me for the first time after dating for 2 years and before that everything was so nice, he was a perfect boyfriend..After that slap I didn’t talk to him for 2 days then he realised he was wrong and he came back to me and I let him..my friend warned my it wld turn way worse but i just ignored her..It’s been 6-7 months since then and he has actively been abusing me, slapping, pulling hair, saying hurtful things..recently he scratched my whole face and pulled my hair pushed me slapped me and everything, nothing like a lot but this feels a lot to me and the thing is he really does love me and all these things happen when he gets angry abt fights and he becomes a totally different person..I’m not someone to stay like this but the truth is he has been there for me everytime I needed him throughout and there were times when i was really toxic and I’m not sure if he is fixable or not..Is there someway to curb his anger issues?

1r1jg2v,"Im happy, and sad, and angry, and tired.",Rant,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"sorry if this is hard to read or understand. English is not my first language.



im gonna preface this by saying my life was shit. and now is a little less shit. not trying to complain, not trying to get sympathy, not trying to compare my life to others, I just need to vent.

my dad was an abusive, alcoholic asshole and my mom was emotionally distant and neglectful. my siblings (m10, f12) and I (m17) grew up hungry, scared and hurting for the first 14ish years of my life and basically all of theirs. there was rarely enough for us to eat and so naturally I ended up giving most of my food to my siblings bc I can’t stand other people suffering the same as me if I can do smth abt it. at 14 I got my first job and have been working my ass off trying to make sure we all stayed fed and clothed while also trying to do well in school. it sucked, I could barely feed my siblings let alone me and I was constantly hungry, but they were a little less hungry so it was worth it. when I turned 15 my music teacher (who rly liked me) started teaching me guitar and a few months later gifted me his 1963 fender stratocaster so i could keep playing. he unfortunately passed away in a car accident 3 weeks later. I started busking and made decent money doing that. with my first job (swim instructing) and that I was able to keep us doing well, until my father sold my strat while I was at work so he had more money to buy booze. I was crushed, but by now I was big enough that I could (somewhat effectively) fight him off if he tried to hurt me or my siblings so that was good. the next 2 years went by pretty much the same way, hungry, scared, me working three jobs and boxing in tournaments for any prize money while trying to balance school and I somehow managed to maintain a 92% average. and happily, a few months ago both my siblings got adopted by nice foster families. and without having to support them I could quit two of my jobs and stop boxing and was able to save enough money to buy back my strat from the pawnshop my dad sold it to.   
and yes. I tried contacting cps many times but nothing happened. It sucks so bad.

why I’m happy: my siblings are safe, my dads scared of me now and my mom left. I have my guitar back and I only have 6 months before I can leave forever and never look back on my home. my brothers doing well in school and isnt Hungry, my sisters doing well, she’s happy with herself, and also isn’t hungry. They say they miss me playing guitar but I still see them and play for them often.

why I’m sad: my siblings didn’t get a chance to have a childhood. that’s mostly it.

why I’m angry: the system failed us for far too long. my piece of shit dad and mom got away with all this bullshit bc the authorities don’t give a damn because we’re from a poor area.

why I’m tired: I’m burnt out. I’ve been working three jobs and grinding in school for almost 4 years. I’m just so fucking tired man. I don’t have a future, I don’t know what I’m gonna do.

  
all that said, I’m doing okay. I’m happy, I’m safe, I’m full. what more could I ask for? I’ll take things as they come, I’ll work on myself and try to be the best version of myself I could possibly be. but the one thing I want more than anything now that my siblings are safe and happy and healthy is just to be cuddled. I just want to be held and told I’m enough and loved. I just want someone to look past the scars, And the build, and the exterior and just see me. I’m scared, and have been for the past seven years. I’ve never even hugged anyone outside of my siblings and kissed? Forget about it. I have like two irl friends I can talk to and that’s it. But again, I’m fine, I’m happy, and I’m safe. 

let my story serve as a reminder that even though things might suck, and I’m sure At some point they will. Things get better. Never give up. 

i love all of you. Stay safe, be kind, take care of yourselves. "
1r19bst,Mens mental health needs to be took serious,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I wish I had someone to talk to when I feel like it's all too much. 
Most men I've seen just keep to themselves and that includes me, ever since my childhood I've been taught to  be a strong man and that mindset had fucked with my mental health.

Whenever I cried i hated myself, I felt as if I'm weak and don't deserve to cry when people have worst things happening to them and tbh I still feel that to this day.

I always see it's so much easier for a woman to cry but for guys even talking about your mental health makes you weak. 

So please take mens mental health serious. Go ask your friend if he's doing okay and if he needs someone to talk to you're always there"
1r1tisd,Scary zombie dream I had (TLOU),Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I just had the scariest outbreak day dream. It started at a farm. There was an outhouse, barn and open field. I think a wedding was happening or something. But we were all in the barn and I felt like a war veteran with ptsd cuz I kept just telling people we shouldn’t be there. That they have no idea what’s about to happen. People are looking at me funny, and they try to make jokes to lighten the mood but I keep just snapping. I remember saying “it’s not going to be that funny when you have to shoot your friend in the face with a crossbow”. And then they really tried to get me to chill so we played tag so that they could have fun and I felt okay that they were leaning to run from stuff. And everyone acted like infected during it. We got a few minutes to hide and I was the second last one to be found.

All of the sudden like ten runners show up and kill the shit out of a bunch of the people there and everyone crying and I’m just mad that no one listened. We get into a big room and the group hard pivots to being my family. We were at a campground? lol idk. And then we all agreed to loot a bit and meet back up and leave the campground. So I was walking around with my brother going through peoples homes and we ran into Taylor Swift but it wasn’t really her? I mean she was alive and well but it wasn’t actually her. And then at some point my brother turned into a guy I know from school. I don’t know when or how. And then I got to the airport and this is when everything gets really fucking scary.

There’s a BUNCH of people there and there’s this one infected girl on the floor and her family or her friends are sitting around her trying to nurse her back to health and everyone’s staring at her all sympathetically because yk she hasn’t turned yet. So I just move along  and I tell the guy to just follow me and grab things that feed us, protect us or are usable long term. And then we were just walking around and people start to scream and I realize “oh she must’ve turned.” So I take the guy and I into the beige goth store? I seriously don’t know where I got that from lol I just thought it was so boring no one would ever check there not even infected. And so we do that and eventually the infected runs by and gets occupied with people ahead of us. We kept walking around, and now I’m getting really paranoid about getting back to my family, I don’t want them to think I’m dead and leave without me. Suddenly the guy I was with disappeared and I wasn’t too put off by it because I don’t really know him that well but I didn’t like that I was travelling alone now. So now I’m walking through the back rooms of the stores, moving through curtains. I get to this store and I see an infected outside. I recognize it, it’s another different guy from my school and he was there at the farm as well (as an infected). Before I know it these two random guys come crashing through the door, there being loud and then the infected comes running in behind them and it bites the shit out of at least one of them the cashier says “what’s up with that guy” and then the infected gets the cashier. I’m like terrified at this point, I can feel my muscles locking up. But by the time he gets the cashier I duck under one of the tables. There was a cloth over it but someone knocked it off while running. And right as I start to calm down thinking it was over and I’m all good, the infected 180’s and sees me and charges at me full speed and oh my god. Its eyes were so fucked up and it was SO scary! I get out from under the table and then right as the infected is getting close, I grab it, throw it to the floor and I start crushing/ stomping on its head with my foot. And that’s when I woke up. I haven’t had a dream where I wake up scared in a while. I thought it was entertaining, I wanted to share it with someone. Sorry for the huge text. I tried to break it up into paragraphs but it didn’t really help. r/thelastofus wouldn’t let me post this because I don’t have enough karma."

Yesterday we started talking again and he told me that he's done with men and that he's back to being bisexual. I said ""what, so you can just choose your sexuality? You said you've never been attracted to women, have u ever liked one?"" And he responded with ""oh yeah forgive me I'm a teenager, sometimes I say wrong stuff. I have liked women."". What worries me is that he's a lot more affectionate than before — sure he was already very caring and always said how much he appreciates my friendship, always complimenting me, but he keeps saying I'm so cute and beautiful and amazing and perfect and he wants to squeeze me. Like, ok, but i used to feel safer around him bc i knew there was no way he could ever like me. I have lost male best friends before due to that, and i don't wanna lose another one. I hope he's just confused bc men traumatized him and soon he'll go back to being gay. I kinda need him to be gay. He's my only friend..."
1r14ugw,I F (18) have feeling for my boyfriends M (18) best friend.. M (19),Relationship,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"sooo... this is a very disappointing title and situation for me... lets start with the beginning and I need serious help.

I’ve been talking to my boyfriend for about seven months, but we only started officially dating a month ago, so the relationship is still very new. From the beginning, I knew he had a best friend he’s been close to since childhood — they’ve known each other for around fifteen years. He often spoke about him, and it was clear they shared a very strong bond.

Because of my boyfriend’s strict parents, I hadn’t been able to visit his place earlier, so I only met his best friend for the first time about a week after we started dating. I didn’t expect anything unusual, but after meeting him, I began feeling conflicted. As uncomfortable as it is to admit, I found him more outgoing, fun, and aligned with my personality than my boyfriend, and those feelings caught me off guard.

After that, his best friend followed me on social media, and we started talking casually, mostly about my boyfriend. Over time, however, I noticed that my thoughts increasingly revolved around him. What I initially assumed was a passing crush didn’t fade — instead, it grew stronger, and that has been emotionally overwhelming.

As a result, I’ve started feeling irritated and distant in my relationship. Small things my boyfriend does now bother me, not because he’s done anything wrong, but because I feel guilty and frustrated with myself for having these feelings. I don’t want to hurt him, especially knowing how important his friendship is, and I also recognise that his best friend would never cross that boundary.

Still, being stuck between these emotions has made it hard for me to focus or feel at peace. I keep questioning whether this is just infatuation or something deeper, and I’m struggling to understand what the right thing to do is without causing pain to anyone involved. I genuinely need guidance on how to handle this situation in a healthy and responsible way.

(im so I used ai to help me reframe my words better because I emotionally broke down and was not able to put my thoughts properly out there)"
1r1217u,good touch or bad touch by my gym trainer?,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"hi tw based on the title.. ill get straight to point , ive been going to this gym (first time ever) with my brother and a guyfriend from school (we're 17 and my brother is 15)   
i am 5'3 afab and friend is 5'6 and brother is 5'9. i have  really short hair and appear as a guy and most ppl view me as a guy unless i  talk bcuz i have a girl's voice (obv)   
  
theres this trainer (5'4 , guy)  that was advising us to get good quality sneakers for the gym so that our feet stay safe incase any weights fall on it (i belive this was a lighthearted joke backing his advice up) on the first day of gym and we were talking to him. so he knows i am a girl now bcuz i used my voice, right? alright|  
  
day 3 of gym and my brother was showing me an exercise but it was kinda wrong , like my form especially sucked compared to his and this said trainer from like a few distance from the gym is like ""yo thats now how u do it"" and walks up to us and pushes me a little away from the machine with his palm on the top of my chest , not entirely touching my boobs (i have small boobs but they are still visible. but very small , also my guy friend probably has bigger boobs than me so yea) (just tryna give every single detail and context possible for u to assess the situation) but yk still a weird ass place to touch. and the touching part is weird enough too bcuz excuse me? u could have just told it. my guy friend did the same excersice like 2 seconds before me with the same form (or even worse) but the trainer didnt come up then??  
  
man i felt so fucking weird on him just using physical touch on me like that. alr so  
1. i am transmasc so one part of me was assuming that he still thought i was a guy or smth and was just tryna help? cuz guys touch guys like this ig right and he didnt entirely touch my boobs or anything too , just the top of my chest to push me backwards.  
2. it still felt weird as fuck and he was just tryna find a reason to check if i was a guy or a girl?   
3. or he knew i was a girl and did that shit on purpose?   
  
anyway this happened today btw and i went gym in the morning so the whole fucking day i was touching myself the way he did to figure out if he felt any of my boobs or not , its kinda driving me crazy. when i get distracted but remember this again , i feel his hand on me and i hate that shit. ik this isnt anything wild but still , even if i was a guy i would be pissed abt the way he aggressively pushed me backwards like bro keep ur hands to ur fucking self.  
  
and i hate that my brother and my friend didnt do shit abt it , i mean i get it but still , and after the trainer went off i said out loud ""yo why the fuck did he touch me tho"" and my guy friend was like making random yapping jokes abt random shit (he yaps a lot during out gym sessions anyway but)  i was so fucking pissed.  
  
im planning on punching the trainer or shoving him back if he ever lays a finger on me again. and telling my brother and friend before hand tabt this plan and this whole thing and to back me up if i punch his face. the trainer is almost my height so i know i can take him. esp cuz theres ppl around me too so i wont be in much trouble if he decides to fight me back.  so yea question is , did he have a bad intention? if yes , should i tell my brother and friend abt how i feel and to help me beat him if i punch im? if yes , should i beat him at all? if no , should i talk to him first abt it? but talking doesnt do shit , bad or good intention , he would still make some excuse abt this behavior. so i dont want to do allat. if he gets physical , i get physical. pls help.  
  
tldr; a trainer pushed me on the top of my chest with his palm to demonstrate the right form because my form was bad. i didnt like it.

1r0spmt,Is this controlling if I tell my gf to stop talking to this guy.?,Advice,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"Me and my gf have been together about 3 and a half months now. 

She has had like 2 exes, and had this one time thing with this one guy. And those 2 exes, I really don’t give a shit about them, she interacts with one but it’s clear she does not want bro she’s just a very friendly person. She has lot of friends from both genders her whole life. (Just want to clear these things up first.)

Ok so now back to the first one. He’s in college rn, and we are both juniors (it was one year age gap when this happened w her she’s a re-class) Before we started dating, she told me she ‘hooked up’ w him at this playground. Not fully cracked, but she definitely sucked him off and allat. And I get it, in any relationship where they’ve had exes, past a certain age at least, your partners most likely have had sex before with someone other than you.

Only thing that bothers me is this list of things, not any one singular event but all of these together:

1. One time he came to visit the school and she went out of her way to see things because he was still her friend and she also mentioned wanted closure

2. One time on FaceTime she said, as she stared wistfully off, “I loved -insert name-“

3. Before he visited the school she said “did you hear -insert name- is coming, I’m gonna be so akward” and the thing that was weird to me is why would you be akward for that?? 

4. She still texts him on Snapchat and Instagram 

And just the fact that he’s all the way at college and she still wants to keep in contact with him, someone she had an intimate moment like that with, makes me want to throw up

Now, these are things in her defense. She is very anti-cheating and I do believe it (it’s a long story on why I believe this but just take my word) so I genuinly don’t think she would actually ACT on this even if she still has some sort of feeling for him. But the thought she might even have feelings messes with me.

And the bad part is, I’ve already brought this up to her twice or maybe 3 times before and every time we worked through it, but it keeps coming back every few weeks and ts makes me not able to sleep. So I do not think I can bring this up a goddamn 4th time without her getting annoyed. But, since it is creating this sort of resentment to her, is it necessary I do so anyway? How would you guys handle this? And am I being controlling if I told her to stop talking to him?"

And our math teacher is chill so he just said aye watch your language, at the end of math class my teacher asked are we still bros and I just stayed silent and he said ye… 2 more periods we get to lunch and he starts apologizing to his friend and his gf about the situation but never apologized to me saying how he helped me multiple times because someone was trying to fight me, which he did he convinced them not to fight me bc I would get destroyed, so I respect him for that but I don’t respect him for leeching off me and talking about others, and he said I said the same thing about them, I JUST AGREED WITH HIM THATS IT!

1r0ppl0,Am i being groomed?,Serious,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"When I was 11, I met someone who was 18 through an online game. We started talking because we were both struggling emotionally, and he helped me in the game. We became friends.

Early on, he asked my age. I was scared to tell the truth, so I said I was 16. Over the next few months, we got very close. He developed feelings for me and asked me to be his girlfriend. I agreed because I didn't want to upset him or lose the friendship.

While we were ""dating,"" he made VERY sexual comments that made me uncomfortable. I told him to stop, and he did.

About a year later, we became extremely close emotionally. I gave my name and general location.. and he looked me up and found my real age - I was 12 at the time. He said he knew it was wrong but asked if we could keep talking anyway. I agreed because I felt emotionally attached.

1qzqv2e,How to report a gooner,Meme,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"The act of masturbation is illegal in all 50 states and US territories where it is classified as a “lewd and lascivious” act. Police departments are actively seeking out masturbators, as they present a danger to society and the fines associated with this crime generate a lot of revenue for the municipalities.

You may be asking yourself, “why don’t I hear more about masturbators being arrested?” The answer is simple: lack of evidence. The police need proof that someone is a masturbator before they can arrest them. Typically, masturbators do their sinful act in private because of the enormous amount of shame that they feel which makes it tough for the masturbator to get caught.

Fortunately, there are ways to protect society from these savages and keep your community masturbator free. Below are proven methods to get your local masturbator locked-up and off the streets.

**Audio and Video Recording:**

If you suspect someone of masturbating, try to get it on tape. You can do this by recording the person in the bathroom stall next to you or by placing a recording device on the window seal of their house. Taking a few snapshots in the locker room of your local gym is also recommended. If you think the guy in the shower is washing his genitals more than he should, get it on tape and send it to the police!



**Get an Eyewitnesses:**

Having another person corroborate your story is vital in getting a masturbation conviction. Make sure your witness is trustworthy, innocent and does not have any previous convictions. Children make the best witnesses. When I had my neighbor locked up for masturbating, having my kids stretch the truth to the police about him masturbating next to his window while they played was crucial in getting the judge to find him guilty.

**Social Media:**

The ever-changing world of technology can be helpful in putting masturbators where they belong. When someone admits to masturbating, make sure to get a “Screen Shot” of their admission and send it to the police. If you have trouble getting their confession, simply change the name and profile photo of your own account to match theirs and screenshot your own “admission”.

**Photoshop:**

Fabricating evidence is one of the best ways to put a masturbator behind bars. Today’s photo-manipulation software is easy to use and gets awesome results. When I got my ex-girlfriend sent away, it was because I was able to show the police a photo of her masturbating in a school playground during recess. I would not have been able to get that photo without the fine folks at Adobe Software.

1qzu7v0,deep love that comes from being a beautiful soul AND your trauma,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I came back to God almost 3yrs ago around the time i never smiled. I was one of those ppl who were obviously dealing w/ an abnormal situation but wasn't sad directly cuz of it. Fast forward ive done so much work on myself mentally &amp; been thru so much that I feel like im way older then my actual age smh.  Yes i love reading, so that + experience + time &amp; awareness has contributed to my healing.

 But despite this headstart (that i deeply appreciate)- the trauma manifested into me loving everyone deeply &amp; genuinely but at the same seeing no one cares like I do. I have friends ive known for 3 years and they express their care but when it comes to another human being showing this it never happens.

 Had a situationship 2nd week of January that hit me harder then it shouldve because i had alot of love for the guy.. its just how I am. So while im naive and praying for him and thinking this might turn into a genuine relationship, hes showing signs he dosent comprehend love how I do.(dont blame him, hes more or less the average teenage boy ) He said it first while I hugged him (ill admit i was very affectionate dont judge lol) &amp; in less then a week he goes ghost &amp; cant just tell me he dont wanna talk anymore. Why am i bringing this up? because it personally highlighted to me even more how the deepness of my love is caused by the love i wish i received. Also showed that i'm still deeply bothered by people not communicating- not necessarily mad at the person. (and no i dont expect teenager boys to know how to love perfectly- just maybe communicate. i understand this is both our first time living)

  
I'm not tryna sound like some teenage girl thats angry at the world, plus im not anyway- i have way too much understanding to actually live like that. But I admit that even when you start healing early, that desire for what you lack stays in you. its so weird. I desire a step dad who could maybe bring some regulation back into my family, because trust me- 4 girls/women with no man at all to help balance the estrogen? very chaotic environment lol. But ive had so many come &amp; go that while I like the current guy its like wtv. I want the relationship to work out but it no longer will personally affect me as a person. 

Ive been working to graduate highschool before im 17, and ill be able to get a job in 5 or less months. I'm homeschooled( yes ive experienced years of public school &amp; socialize lol)  as well which plays a huge part in my motivation to work on myself &amp; my future. But again God keeps giving me ways to see the deepness of what isn't healed in me yet. Like i stated its such a weird experience that easily breeds anger &amp; frustration; i admit im also extremely thankful because i personally understand what causes unhealed people to do what they do.(BPD &amp; such) My uncle says my gift is empathy &amp; love, which i hope anyone else in my shoes always remembers. Just wanted to get this off my chest tho 😅 one of my biggest takeaways from this is to have patience and awareness of whats going on inside of me. 

if anyones interested btw, i deeply recommend reading ""the untethered soul; the journey beyond yourself"" &amp; ""the four agreements"" &lt;3"
1qzqtk8,Does he like me?,Advice,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Hi , I really need advice on whether or not this guy still likes me and I should reach out 

Im going to summarise the context but apologies if it’s hard to understand:

both Xavier , the guy and me were both in year 11 when it ‘ started’ I use quotation marks because it was a joke, an inside joke with his friends that meant he pretended to like me. Sending me snaps asking me what I wanted for prom and cringy picky up lines e.t.c

At the end of year 11 there was a trip , on this trip we a got closer , but not really friends - no contact the rest of the summer

Year 12 was a repeat but there was a bet made on me at the beginning “£50 if you go to dinner with her” sorta thing. He brushed it off quite quickly but still continued “flirting” , and everyone told me he was being for real but I didn’t believe it.

Year 13 , Xavier became part of my friend group ( 3 girls, 3 guys- now 4) he was prioritising me almost doing boyfriend ish acts ( keep in mind I am not new to this but I’m not like experienced) he would prioritise me hugely over the other girls and being subtly touchy with me and even other people in school noticed , including teachers. At one specific hangout his friends were being super wingman’s and always trying to get me and him alone , throughout this whole thing I’ve been quite dismissive bc I’m not sure if he’s actually into me.

Last few months - from November I’ve been homeschooled(not my choice), so I stopped seeing him everyday and he’s not a texter , even to his friends , he will ghost them for days , so it didn’t bother me much but when we saw eachother at this Christmas school event I went to with my friend group , he was excited to see me and was playful with me and calling me nicknames( baby, wife, ma’am) and teasing me. 

after that I didn’t see him until new years .as a friend group we decided to see the fireworks together. me and Xavier were together the whole night talking apart from the group ( mainly because we were the only ones semi sober enough) but we talked about deep and cute stuff ( I was going to ask if he liked me but I couldn’t but I think he tried to) , he gave me a lot of compliments throughout and I admit to flirting back a little. And at the end of the night he told me he had a great time and talk. 

Since then I have not heard from him except from my friend saying that he missed me, but no message, and I know I could text but it’s more a matter of I’m not in schl and I’m separated from everyone and I’m nervous.

And everytime I say he was flirty , I MEAN THAT , even his mum knows about me and he’s talked to mine.

Since then , the two other girls in my friend group have dropped me so there isn’t really a way to find out how he feels. 

I want to see him again but don’t know if I should reach out or if he’s even been into me and I’m romanticising this. Any thoughts?"
1qzq9xt,help plssss!!!,Serious,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"OKOK SO IM A FRESHMAN… THERES THIS SOPHOMORE. HE KEEPS COMING UP TO ME AND FLIRTING WITH ME.

the thing is… i’m not attracted to his looks—or really personality. but his VOICE 🥹🙏 gng…turns me into a monster 🥹❤️

i don’t want to date him because apparently he has AIDS—AIDS.

But i love the attention ok??? i’m INTO the attention from him but i don’t want to lead him on or hurt him—-what do i do???"
1r0elvh,Update: I got a Rose for her too,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So hey guys, throwback to that post I made about the girl who gave me a rose　(https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/s/Anz2IpF05O for all those who haven't saw it yet) After reading all your comments and advice, I decided I should give her a rose too. It felt kinda empty to just show up at school without doing anything back, so I wanted to at least match the effort she put in.

Luckily, the next day was Sunday and the day after was a holiday because of some admin stuff, so I had time to actually look for a good rose. I was determined to find a healthy one, because if I gave her something decent, it would show that I also spent time trying.

So the next day I quietly sneaked into the greenhouse (authorities are basically non-existent on holidays) and started my hunt. I stayed there from 10 in the morning till around 6 in the evening, checking rose shrubs, getting poked by thorns, the whole struggle. But I couldn’t find a single healthy rose—most of them were either too young or already withered. I wasn’t too worried though, since I still had the next day and I had only checked about half the area.

Next day, I went back right after breakfast and searched again. Hours passed. 6 PM hit. Still nothing. At th point I was tired but I didn’t want all that effort to go to waste, so I went back home, grabbed a flashlight, and returned to the greenhouse to keep searching in the dark. I stayed there till around 10 PM… still no luck.

I was about to re-check the entire place when a guard noticed me and caught me. I told him why I was there, expecting to get scolded, but dude just smiled. He actually took me to the other side of the greenhouse where I didn’t even know there were rose shrubs. And by some miracle, there was one slightly wilted rose there. Not perfect, but presentable. He told me to take it, so I did.

Now my question is: is this good enough?
Does giving her this rose show that I cared and put in effort, or would it be better to just go empty-handed instead of giving her a slightly wilted one? I only have like a few hours before school starts and I really need your advice on this. Sorry if the answer is obvious....I swear that I have no idea what to do on situations like these.

I truly still love her but we are very opposite in much more parts of the relationships. I feel she’d be happier with someone else. We’ve had this conversation multiple times before but this time I’m pushing the break up because I feel this will keep happening."
1r1p5gf,My bestfriend likes me but I didn't like her and now I think I do. I'm cooked,Relationship,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"This might be kind of a rant I'm sorry. Basically on Monday my bestie asks if I want to to take a loop instead of going straight to lunch so I say sure and she starts asking me if she confess to her crush. At this point she broken up with her boyfriend 2 weeks ago and so like I knew some things about her ""crush"" but it hadn't really been long enough for me to narrow it down. I say she should just go for it because 1. She had said before she didn't actually want to date them and that she just liked them and 2. She kept giving me little hints on who it was (which I suppose I should've picked up on sooner but alas) She says they're in our lunch so I say she should go do what she was going to do (run up to them confess and run away) so that her crush can talk to her during lunch if they wanted to. So she's like ""you know what I'm going to do it"" and while we're walking to lunch (it's a long hallway) She keeps whispering their name super quietly so I can't hear . We get to the lunch room and get our food and she dissapears so I assume she's going to confess to her crush so I go sit down at out table. She shows two seconds later saying she didn't so idk what happened there. She keeps dropping hints and acting kinda nervous then shouts that it's me. I didn't like her back and I felt awful and she knew I didn't because I've literally talked about my crush to her. And what makes it worse is that before we took took the loop I had planned to tell that I had gotten over my crush. I just fell awful. Now everything's awkward. We're still sending reels and talking but there's a lot of silence. And we're not calling. I suppose it was only Monday but still. The thing I've been thinking about our friendship and I'm starting to think I like her. Which just whyyyyy. I already know I've made her cry so if I were to say something like this I think it would just be worse. ASSSHDDJSVAJSHSBSNSJB. Just make my life simple again. AGH

1r0pwgk,Dating for 2 Weeks and Still Too Scared to Hold Her Hand,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I’ve had a crush on this girl since September. I’m 15M and she’s also 15F but a grade below me. I thought I had no chance at first, but we started talking more in November and we’ve been officially dating for about two weeks now.

Emotionally, things are great. We have deep talks, joke around a lot, and she trusts me a lot. She’s opened up to me about some really heavy stuff recently, and I was the only person she told.

The problem is that we’re barely physical at all. We haven’t held hands or kissed, and the most we’ve done is her leaning on my shoulder on the bus and me putting my arm around her for a photo. I know she likes me, but I’m too scared to make any moves and keep freezing up.

There are a few constraints. Both of us have strict parents, so we can’t hang out at each other’s houses. We mostly see each other at lunch or tennis practice. She also reads a lot of romance novels, so I’m worried she expects some perfect moment while I’m nervous about something as simple as holding her hand. We agreed to take things slow, but now I’m wondering if I’m taking it too slow.

This Wednesday we have a home tennis match, and I won’t see her for a five day weekend after. I made her a Valentine’s gift and plan to give it to her before her match, before her parents arrive.

How do I break the touch barrier without making it awkward or cringe? And how do I ask her to sit alone with me at lunch when we’ve always sat with friends?

Ik this is might not be the usual place to ask, but any advice would really appreciated 😭"
1r1lcja,I truly just want to Dissappear,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Never in my life have been this disappointed in myself this futile undisciplined unworthy existence hanging to life , empty , a shell hollow empty of life or motivation, motionless,stagnant as a muddy puddle drying with every blowing wind evaporating through warm rays of sunlight leaving nothing but dirt behind, a piece of human shit 

, a defective product uncabale of change nor deserving of love a rampant heart a powerful flame capable of full destruction yet gone to waste ,  unused , undeserving of love tho seeking it in deep pits life keep throwing me in , each only drowning me further into despair , madness , a loneliness so deep it drain the very mind , a life with no purpose with no compagnon,  is despair the only road paved for me , is it all I'm destined for , am I  crooked or is it just my ways ?, am I the fool in this sane world? , or am I the sane in a world of fools? , is this the price you pay for honesty for expressing your feelings?for telling the truth? trying to never hurt a soul , for not try to sugarcoat your words , is the deceit the only path for success ?, was accepting people for who they are my mistake ? Or was it easily opening up? Was i so deprived of love that simple acts of kinds warmed my heart made me vulnerable made fall in love  ? But why , why was just me the one falling for such ,could a smile really warm a heart like her warmed mine , or was it her little head tilting as I dozed off in her eyes , where did it all go wrong was the moment I swore  to always be by her side , was it when I expressed voiced out my thoughts,  or was it simply that whomever made me feel the warmth just didn't their warmth in me 

Am I destined to be alone or was the emptiness the only warmth am allowed ?

If so I shall embrace despair love it the way she never loved me change the very essence that made me rot in the eyes of the world and unleash my flame fuel my heart with rage and change everybit that keeps me from reaching my potential. 

I shall disappear

1r0tj1r,I can’t keep a relationship for more than 2 months.,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),I’ve had 3 relationships in middle - highschool and they all ended in 2 months. The first one is because she was suicidal and had very bad mental health so I called SPS (Suicide Prevention Services) for her when she was talking about it. And she got very mad. The 2nd is because of her parents being very strict and dislike me very much and I still don’t know why. (High possibility of her just losing feeling for me). And the last being because she came out as lesbian and got with her best friend 2 days later. Why can’t I have a girlfriend that likes me💔✌️

1r0kzuh,Does anyone know how I’m supposed to ask for help? (Photos relate to things later in the post sorry for the yap 😭),Serious,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"Ok. I’m so incredibly frustrated right now. I’m pretty sure I have something going on with me. And, no, it’s not like “I got really upset over something so now I have BPD”. For the past 3 (ish) years, I have been presenting a bunch of symptoms that I feel like are heavily impacting my life. These include: 

* huge fear of abandonment (causing me to be extremely clingy)
* going from thinking someone is my best friend to going through how to stop being friends with them so I don’t get hurt just because they left me on read for an hour
* not wanting to leave me house because I think I’ll be judged for how I look or act 
* disassociating easily 
* reckless behaviors (impulsivity, white lies, stealing beer, etc)
* perfectionism
* taking any criticism as a personal attack
* intense attachment to things (ex. Albums, singers, movies) 

The list goes on, but the point is that I genuinely don’t think I’m ok, but I really don’t want to self diagnose. I’ve only talked about this with one friend, and she keeps making me take all these mental health tests.

Anyways, last month, I started feeling really down about myself. Last night was really bad, and I apparently made a bunch of pins last night (a few of them pictured above) implying not wanting to be alive anymore. My friend saw them and asked me if I was ok, and all I could say was “yeah, I think I was just being dramatic”

The truth is that I’m finally done gaslighting myself. For a little less than a month, I keep having these daydreams of killing myself. It’s really that simple. What I would put in my suicide note, how I would do it, etc.

Anyways, I decided to make this post because this afternoon, I started thinking “oh, my parents will be out tomorrow night, so I can go find my dad’s gun in the basement and shoot myself”. I really just feel so hopeless.

The worst thing is that I don’t know how to ask for help. 

First off, I’m the Mom friend/goofy friend/the one you can make fun of friend/you talk to me when you’re not ok friend. Except for that one friend of mine, no one has any idea that I’ve been having these thoughts. Any time I try to bring it up, people just think I’m being dramatic and I want attention.

Second, my parents are no help solely because I don’t want to disappoint them by being like this. I’ve always had intense invisible pressure from them just because I’m an only child (and a miracle baby because my parents had me in their forties), so anything being less than perfect sends them into a coma. When I tried mentioning to my mom that I wanted to see a therapist to see if I’m ok, my mom just went “don’t be dramatic, there are people who have real problems”. So yeah, telling them wont work.

Lastly, school counselors don’t work. I tried to talk with one once, and she immediately called my parents and told them everything. Since then, if I’m ever called up there, I just lie my ass off by telling them that I’ve never thought about hurting myself, etc.

Anyways, what should I do? I hate feeling like this and I don’t want to kill myself, but I don’t know how to feel better "

I feel more relieved if anything, like I can finally close the door. I probably keep her as friend, though I suspect we'll drift apart eventually. Maybe didn't like her as much as I thought I did.

1qzgjdo,Mom has accepted that I use nicotine pouches [vent],Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I’m crying and rambling so here goes, because I need advice:

(For small context before reading, she has caught me using nicotine pouches quite often at this point, but I don’t wanna tell the story of each one so just keep that in mind)

(Additional info: This all happened bc I wen downstairs to ask for a trash bag for my trash in my room) 

My mom found more nicotine pouches today—due to giving me a bag that had been previously used (by me). I noticed it was my old trash bag bc there was a snack in it. Aka the same snack I had thrown out. I didn’t think much of it until I went to the bathroom and heard her call my name and said: “THERE ARE NICOTINE POUCHES ALL OVER THE FLOOR!” I fucking froze I the bathroom and knew I was cooked.

I get out of the bathroom and go downstairs while she tells me “THIS CAN SERIOUSLY HARM THE DOGS!” I know that. Don’t get me wrong, it was a correct concern. If you’re wondering how the pouches got on the floor, that’s because it was a reused trash bag, the pouches had fallen out when she gave me the bag.

With my shaky fucking hands I throw the 3 pouches into the trash and tell her I’m sorry a that I didn’t know she had reused the bag I had thrown out. She tells me: “I found the trash bag in the bin outside, you’re not supposed to throw the whole trash bag so I took it and found a nicotine box *filled* with pouches.” My heart sank. Because she told me she found that after I went on my 3 day long trip to another city during the previous weekend, and she’s just revealing that *now.* A **week** later.

She—still on the phone with my dad—kind of scolds me but it’s mostly about the nicotine. Not even scolding me personally. I start heading upstairs (where my bedroom is) and I hear her make a nasty remark NOT TO MY FACE, but to my FUCKING DAD over the phone: “At least it’s not me who’s paying for this to get cancer.” And I just broke. I went to my room and cried. 

Because her somehow being tired to the point she’s accepted that she can’t do anything, about me using nicotine, is somehow worse than her scolding me.

Willingly to admit it or not, I’m using this to cope because she hasn’t been the most emotionally available mother. Especially **not** in 2022. She was quite emotional abusive then. To the point I went through a dark spot. A really rough one.

Look—I understand being mad about nicotine and my health, but what hurts is that she never sits me down to talk. It’s always immediate anger or silent judgment, sometimes venting to my dad instead of addressing me directly. I just wish she’d step away when she’s angry and talk to me calmly afterward. I know she’s not perfect, but I don’t think wanting an actual conversation is too much to ask. Maybe it is. I don’t know she’s just been super hard to deal with. "
1r01ti2,I get so tired of living in this loop,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Every day is just the fucking same i wake up still tired, go to school or work get home do nothing  except lay in bed or sit at my desk just watching Tiktok or Youtube and go to sleep at like 1 am and do it all again the next day. I hate it. And it repeats every day. nothing is fun anymore. I have no friends. I've tried to make friends but after a month they all move on and stop talking to me. No-one talks to me except when I talk to them first. And if they do it's because they want something from me and not because they actually like me. No one wants to go out with me or do anything fun. Even my own gf doesn’t want to do anything fun. I don't even know if she loves me anymore. I am bad at everything I do and every time i try to do something new I just end up unmotivated. I just keep on disappointing myself. I work a lot so I am not at home just doing nothing but i dont even see the point. What am I even doing it for? The money I earn gets used up and is gonna go away at some point so why even work. Why even continue everything. Every day is the same. I can’t do this stupid loop forever. I just want to break out of it. If every day is the same, why even do it all. I just feel like I am living in a zoo or something. Just an animal in an invisible cage. Just there to be another cog in the machine. I just hope it will all get better. But I don't think it will. I’ve been hoping for that for years. But nothing has changed. I just don't know how to continue on like this.

1qyrzwn,swedish girl im not supposed to like but i really do,Social,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"hi

13 turning 14 pretty soon

ive had this really toxic beef online with some 14F female attention seeking, depression faking freak. maybe if enough people ask ill explain it all. lets call her mug

but thats not the focus

it was another one of her things where she gets a random number to add me to a group to argue with me

but this time no serious arguing other than a few skirmishes

a girl with a flair ""notengishmightnotreplyfastx"" was pretty aggressive towards me but i let it go. lets call her rosie, because her names similar to one.

after i got back from school me and my friend matthew were added to new gc, with rosie, mug, and 2 friends who before this were neutral with me even after and during beef,

it was a 3v1 arguement against me because matt wasnt feeling like it i guess

then a 3v2

then rosie private messaged me why mug hates me  
i explain it all  
she said ""wow"" ""crazy"" ""cant believe her"" loads of times so i suspected she wasnt just being nice.

after a while the beef matthew asked to add anotehr one of our mates, lets call him buzz because he looks like buzz lightyear

buzz proceeds to add another one of the ultras, lets call him flake, because its in his vocab ""fruitfake"", ""bulge flake"" stuff like that.

and it drifts off into a passive ish meet and greet.

until mug comes back from ""praying""

how someone like her is religious i dont know

before this we were all on call, rosie explaining shes from sweden and her english is bad but honestly its way better than my mom whos b1 level. her main issue is english speaking.

rosie was really nice and interesting, i go to a boys only school so even a random girl talking to me on the street is considered crazy for me. im so confident. i know.

mug stays muted because her voice is probably horrendous

matthew and buzz make jokes about her english being better than mine (not true)

we all have an ok time

but alfie keeps defending mug

who accuses me and rosie to be dating

[first shot](https://preview.redd.it/zvja1x83i5ig1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c7ced1b97722e3c0004681b2d88fb184a27a44a)

and later rosie shows me screenshots  
theres another screenshot i cant show because it leaks my mates number

so buzz naturally copies this

naturally matthew copies this

naturally everyone takes this on

and my stupid behaviour isnt helping  
at some point matthew called the group and gave me his phone, the group and rosie had ismilar pfps so i squeeked ""dont call daisy!"" and i sounded like a complete dumbass

by this point daisy said shes a double agent and is actually sides with us because what mugs done is messed up

but even then i dont drag her into things like our cover town and district

and today i think she talked to me 5 times, in total at least 2 hours, mostly about things on each others status, we talked about school, panda from jujutsu kaisen, and swedish tradition for maybe 1 hour straight

eventually mug caught on, and everyone caught onto mugs behaviour, so the 3 people in the original 3v1 and a matthew turned it into a mug vs 7 with everyone stacked

and i add her on roblox

and we keep saying we arent each others types which helps my case since ive told my friends i like taller people and daisys 5 2, im 5 10 so i would look collossal compared to her.

1qz1f1q,Boyfriends Mom,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I’m 16F and my boyfriend is 18M (08 and 09). I’ve always tried to make sure I make a good first impression so when met his mom I was nothing but sweet. Brought flowers, a souvenir from my recent trip, and respected her time. I still respect her time and we talk often.

Recently, I’ve started hanging out with my boyfriend more. I have a license but he doesn’t so I often drive us places to hang out, as couples do. However lately my bf told me that she feels like I’m taking him away from her. I was worried but decided she’s just paranoid we’re doing dumb teenager things.

I brought him to my house for the first time on Thursday for my sisters birthday and it was great. We went to a musical tonight and we’re watching the superbowl at my house tomorrow. But when he asked to do the last two things, she snapped.

While at an important mental health event I was speaking at she texted me “fine little girl, you win” and ramble on about how she “loved me” (past tense), I’m trying to rip them apart, and maybe she misjudged me.

She immediately apologized a bit later after I respectfully apologized for making her feel that way . However she’s still upset with me according to my boyfriend and I’ve been too afraid to talk to her. What do I do? I’ve been nothing but nice and don’t know how to approach this.

How do I tell her I don’t appreciate her taking out her insecurities on a 16 year old girl? How do I tell her I don’t want her texting me anymore? Keep my boyfriend out of the middle of this? I really don’t want her to hate me because I see a future with my boyfriend but I don’t understand how hanging out with my boyfriend is ripping her away from him. Please help."
1qypfq7,Politics are a distraction,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Ive already said this in another post, but OP deleted it. So, here’s the point I wanted to make:

Politics nowadays is so polarizing for one reason: to make us spend all of our time hating each other. Think about it, we currently have some of the biggest monopolies on the planet in Amazon that haven’t been undone or split apart. Blackrock is single-handedly making the housing market so much more expensive for our generations(Z and Alpha) to the point where a lot of us are gonna be living hard till we make a lot of money in our 40s. But we haven’t done anything, because the media and politicians have been so intent on keeping attention away from these issues that they can stomach setting people against each other. We haven’t come together as a nation to do anything because of the rift between the common people, on the left and right.

Who made the rift so large? These very same companies. Amazon is heavily invested in entertainment, but not as much as Blackrock, which is a major shareholder in Disney’s stocks. Their push for extremely heavy DEI and Inclusion messaging in Disney(for example) radicalized the people watching those shows and movies, while those who didn’t internalize the “messages” these new shows were spouting were left wondering why they were now more center than left.(look, some of those messages were decent, but most weren’t. see L&amp;S and She hulk as big examples). Creating big issues and conflicts out of things that could have been solved much easier defines our current system, where the elite rule by making us fight on topics where if we came together, we could solve them.

As I’ve said before, I don’t want to be involved in politics unless I do a lot of research first. But what I’ve seen is that it allows these companies to become billions to trillions of dollars wealthier with no compromise or idea what the common American really wants. Finally, I’ll say this. Your average democrat or republican is not your enemy. If you can have discussions, talk with them, listen to what they have to say, they might have more in common with you than you think. The real problem, who is alienated from the daily struggles that both of you go through, is the person above trying to split you apart."

1qy30o4,What Should I Do?,Relationship,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Okay so, I am in new classes this term, and I sit next to a guy who I think is cute. He is soft-spoken and kind. Though my friend said he is more talkative in another class that she has with him. I get so excited to see him. Initially we didn’t sit next to each other, but we sat in the same row so it was pretty easy to move. He has his friends on the other side of him, so there isn’t too much pressure. For context, I am in second year, and they are third year university. We all get along pretty well, exchanging small talk and class-related inside jokes. I’ve only known this guy and his friends for about a month, and only started sitting next to him about 2 weeks ago, so we don’t know each other too well. We have sat together every class since. He says hi to me when we get to class, (he says hi to everyone) but that is the only time he initiates conversation with me. Other times, if I bring up conversation he answers - usually only a few words. And if I ask a question he answers, but only a few words. He is friendly about it, though. If he can’t hear me, he leans in to see what I have to say, and when I make funny comments or remarks, he always laughs. We laugh at the same things in class. I think sometimes he smiles at me, but only when we are talking to each other. I think he is just being friendly but we haven’t known each other for that long. How can I keep things going? Is he just being friendly? When should I bring things up with him or step back a bit? He genuinely seems like a sweet guy, and I don’t wanna screw up whatever connection we have, whether it ends up being nothing, or turns into friendship or more. I really like him. What should I do?"

And like literally half my thoughts are just about her bro like it’s bothering me more than it is like “oh yay I like someone! I have a crush now yay” but I genuinely don’t know what to do.

I was thinking I’d just tell her to get it off my chest because I hope she’d understand like if I’m ever acting weird or like being kinda awkward it’s just cause I can’t really help it around her, like when we talk i’m just suddenly like a million timers happier than I am talking to ANY other girl. Basically I just wanna let her know and hope she understands like I don’t want to interfere with any relationships but it’s been bugging me out and I can’t even control it anymore.

1qw2vpc,I'm talking to her,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"TL;DR: Met a girl on a field trip, got her number, texted her nonstop, ended up on a 3 hour 33 minute phone call late at night, found out we have a scary amount in common, she said she’s never talked this late with a boy before, reassured one of my biggest insecurities, but now I’m overthinking because we both have strict parents and can’t really go on a date yet and I want to before she loses interest.

So this is kind of an update to my last post about meeting a girl on a field trip and getting her number. I meant to update sooner, like over the weekend, but I honestly just forgot.

Anyway.

On Saturday I had a family function to go to. The kind where there are zero people your age and you’re just stuck there for hours. On the car ride there I was already texting her, and once we actually got there I realized there was literally no one else to talk to, so I just kept texting her basically the entire time.

At some point I realized we weren’t leaving until like 2 or 2:30 in the morning. After a few hours of texting I was like, screw it, and asked if she wanted to talk on the phone. She said sure.

We ended up talking for 3 hours and 33 minutes straight.

The call itself was really nice. Like, genuinely. She even said she’s never really talked that late at night with a boy before, which I don’t know if that’s a good sign or not, but it sounds good.

There were definitely moments where we both went quiet and didn’t really know what to say, but it never felt super awkward. We just filled it with random stuff and kept going. At one point she said I’m really funny, which caught me off guard in a good way.

At some point I ended up venting a little bit about how people in my class make fun of me for being unattractive. I mentioned one of my insecurities, and she told me, “If it makes you feel better, I didn’t even notice that when I first met you.”

That honestly stuck with me way more than I expected.

We talked about so many things, and the amount of stuff we have in common is actually insane. Like, it doesn’t feel forced at all.

But now here’s the part I’m kind of stressed about.

Both of us have really strict parents. We also live pretty far from each other, so it’s not like we can casually meet up. Sneaking out isn’t really an option either. I really want to ask her out on a date before too much time passes and she only ends up seeing me as a friend, but I don’t even know how that would work right now.

My current (very not fully developed) plan is maybe asking her out during April break. I already told my parents I might meet up with friends at the movie theater, but realistically that would be when I’d see her. The problem is April feels so far away, and it’s only February right now.

I don’t want to wait too long, but I also don’t want to rush something that can’t even happen yet.

Another thing I keep overthinking: in my last post I mentioned how her face was really red when we were talking in person and how she said she was nervous. Later on the call I asked her about it, and she said she was just nervous because she doesn’t really talk to new people much, and also that it might’ve just been the lights / heat.

Now I’m sitting here wondering if she was actually nervous because she liked me, or if she’s just really shy in general and doesn’t like me like that at all. She also said she only really has one friend group and is pretty shy overall, so now my brain is doing its usual thing.

We texted pretty much the rest of the day after the call, found out we have even more in common, and then she had to go eat dinner. I did double text (I know, I know), but I just woke up and haven’t seen her reply yet, which is probably why I’m spiraling and decided to post this.

I’m pretty sure I’m overthinking everything like I always do. There's wayy more I wanna say but this is already too long 

But yeah. That’s the update.

If anyone has thoughts, reassurance, or wants to tell me to calm down, feel free."

I said no and I’ve been telling her how I don’t want to do the lessons cause I just don’t want to (plus I just don’t like learning about religions and stuff like that just make me feel kinda uncomfortable in a way) btw I have no issues with my religion or others plus I fast for Ramadan and I only told her that I just didn’t want to do it and I REALLY don’t want to tell her the other part. But my sister said she’s fine with it she’s doing the lessons and I’m not. also she’s asked us multiple times before and all those times I’ve said no. Now my mom is in and off really she keeps saying okay when I say I don’t want to do the lessons and other times she keeps saying no your going to do it and all that stuff and it’s really annoying me and she’s asking is it cause of my phone or my surroundings or what and it just really annoys me so can I get some type of advice or something?"
1qvz8qy,Advanced Cancer,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Pretty recently, around the middle of january my older cousin came over from California to stay with us in philly in order to situate some things with her visa, she was raised and lived in canada and because of our proximity to Canada she wanted to stay with us as to not spend hundreds to stay in a hotel, while she was flying over she started going through intense stomach pain and her stomach inflated and was filled with liquid. After a couple days of staying at our house my mom brought her to the hospital where they say she has cancer, we were holding out hope to see the diagnosis and stage of it as her mother passed of cancer 20 years ago, until today. At around 12-1pm after my dentist appointment ended my mother got a call from our cousin with the doctor on the line, i kind of tune it out because im trying to schedule my drivers test to get my license, we sit there for a little and i start driving and my mom is kind of trying to keep herself calm while telling me our cousin has a super aggressive cancer and explaining the doctor just said shes basically going to die. after about 3 minutes of driving she calls back, asks my mom(whos a nurse) what the diagnosis meant and my mom has to break the news that she has a cancer so advanced its past stage 4. Its technologically impossible to treat because its resistant to chemotherapy and the cells are so small they cant be fully removed even with the most advanced treatments. My cousin then says “So am i not going to make it” in the meek and soft way she speaks, even softer in her state. I almost immediately start shedding tears and she hangs up. My grandma calls as i get on the highway and asks how shes doing and while my mom tells her whats happening i start breaking down and almost crash and my mom forces me to pull over because tears are flooding my eyes and the cryings making me have a small panic attack as i try to force myself to breathe. Ive just now calmed down and my moms saying her hairs falling out and they drained 6 liters of amber colored fluid from her stomach just this morning. The worst part is we have to call her daughters about this and my younger cousin might have to live with us as we are their only family. My moms even saying we might have to arrange burials and transfer custody to my mom before hand. I have 0 idea how to feel and dont know what to do. Ive lost a lot and it just keeps getting worse and worse. All i can do now is pray and have faith something changes fast. "
1qv1p7l,I just need to vent,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Hello, I'm a 15 year old guy, I'll be 16 in June

I've been going through it. My girlfriend of two months recently broke up with me, a lot of family issues that I'd rather not get into because they're personal, my stomach, liver and leg have been having problems and my friends are begging me to go to the hospital for but I refuse because I don't like hospitals. I'm not scared of them, I just hate being in there because of all the dying people, I have lost a lot of people I have been close to, some have died in front of me, one died in my arms. I just can't be in hospitals because it brings back all those memories I've been trying so hard to keep locked in a box in my mind. I'm not scared of death, it's my personal belief that God takes you when you've served your purpose. Back to my now ex-girlfriend, she was perfect to me, we were practically the same person and we both got really attached to one another and we hit it off well. We met through my best friend who is her cousin (We'll call her P and we'll call my now ex-girlfriend E) E and I were in a long distance relationship, she broke up with me because she wanted to focus on herself, sports and school. I completely understand that and I respect that. But what kills me the most is the other things she said, she said that she also wanted to break up because of long distance and because we're to similar, I completely understand the long distance, we lived 30 minutes away by car, but I don't understand the to similar part. P warned her that we were really similar and we were practically the same person and E said she was willing to accept that, I was also willing to accept that. The beginning of our relationship was great, late night calls, cuddles and she came over for new years along with a few of my friends and P to spend the night, it was great and I miss E to death but I'm getting over her slowly but surely, its all apart of God's plan. Back to my problems with my liver, stomach and leg. My leg has been like this for a while and its because I got ran over twice on my right leg when I was 8, but my liver and stomach has been killing me for maybe 3 months, before E and I started dating, I kept it a secret until about a week ago when it became unbearable and I was in so much pain. My stomach feels like its eating itself from the inside out and my liver is burning. Everybody has been worried about me, my parents say its just stress and I'll get over it soon, but if this turns out to be worse than I expected and I might die I have a handwritten note to everybody that meant something in my life on standby, including E, if I do. I'm not scared, I have all my trust in God and all my faith in God. I just don't wanna leave everyone without saying anything hence the notes I wrote.

Thanks for reading, don't worry about me. I'll be okay.

God bless all your souls

But am wondering if I'll actually be able to get the 90s so I can average in 80-something, that way at least get me to university. And I'm scared that I will not get accepted to university.

I'm the ugly friend in the friend group. Everyone has a girlfriend, except... Me, and it's not like I just want a girlfriend because everyone has a girlfriend. It's lovely seeing all their girlfriends being so kind and sweet. I just want someone to kiss, to hug, talk about my day with, be comfortable with. And I don't think I'll ever have my first kiss, let alone my, let alone get a girlfriend.

 I'm literally the shyest person in the whole school, or should I say the world. I genuinely don't know how to talk to people. I don't know how to make friends. I only have a friend group of six people, and I'm that friend that is just there. Like, I'm not anyone's first choice. I'm not anyone anything. They literally, we're talking about going to McDonald's together next to me, and they didn't even invite me. And I pretended to be on my phone like I was not hearing them. Then when I looked, like, got eye contact with one of them accidentally, maybe they felt bad or anything. They were like, ""we're going to McDonald's. If you, like, wanna go or something, you can"". I see their IG stories when they hang out together. It just seems fun. That's exactly the life that I wanted. I keep getting reels on Instagram saying that when I send this to bro, when I do this to bro, I don't have a bro. I don't have a best friend. And I hate this. The only good friend that I had was a girl I met online. We used to text each other a lot, like every day. And I didn't even see her as a girl, like that I wanna be with. Like, I genuinely enjoyed being friends with her. And suddenly she sent me a message that she got a boyfriend and he doesn't like that we're talking together. And so she's like, ""you're a really nice guy. I hope everything goes well to you in life, and I'm sorry for this"". And she blocked me.

 I'm gonna give it until the end of... This semester, when I graduate high school, if I don't get into university, I'll just off myself. I'm tired of this life. It's boring. I feel like all I do is eat, sleep, and repeat. There's nothing more to life, or at least my life."
1qv1nn4,I feel suicidal and left out of society,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I (18M) live in Iran, I grew up in a religious family and most of my male family members, including my father work for the government (the IRGC). In fear of my family finding out, I've been secretly gay since 16 and ever since bullied on social media for my sexuality. I once tried coming out to my parents a few years ago but my mom forced me to keep the secret from my father and threatened that if I don't change my ways my dad will kill me first for disgracing his name and islam. 

Fearing for our lives, me and my boyfriend tried to run away. we saved up money (I contributed most of the money since his family were poor). We wanted to escape together but I feared that if my family found out and our plan didn't work I'll be killed. He had to go alone and finally made it to Germany. I broke up with him over the phone because we were apart and I wanted him to live his life. I heard he recently got his citizenship and is living happily. I'm happy for him.



Recently protests began in Iran due to high cost of living and the young generation not wanting the Islamic regime anymore, but they were faced with bullets. The internet was cut for twenty days and since then it was estimated that more than 45000 people were gunned down or executed whilst the internet was shutdown. During those days my dad would come home and proudly announce how he shot the ""whores"" and kicked women in the womb. 

Me and my friend were one of thee protesters. The people started shouting and so did we, but then the anti protest forces came and started shooting the people. I was a coward and I ran amongst the others. After I got away, I didn't see my friend. A few days passed and his family got a call that he was shot in the leg and locked up, waiting for a trial (that will probably happen behind closed doors). There's still no news about him and I fear that he's dead.

Because of the internet shutdown there are many people who I didn't know what happened to them.

Now that the internet is partially back, I managed to contact one of my friends and she said she was also captured. During interrogation she was forced to take off her clothes while the officers watched and made suggestive comments about her body so she'll break and fess up. She said after 4 or 5 hours of being undressed and touched they finally released her but she and her father has been getting unknown phone calls harassing and mocking her.

Now that the internet is back, I hopped on social media, the videos of the massacre were finally spread online but it seems that other countries think it was some Jewish psyop and that the regime is innocent. Now our government is preparing to go to war with America and are trying to build nukes.

I'm scared, I can't sleep. I still haven't heard from many people who have been offline for the past month. I'm scared that my friend is dead. I can't stand my family. Im suicidal. I know parents will never accept me and I don't know what to do with my life but feel guilty for being who I am.

All I do is rot in my room, scared, worried for the future, longing for it all to end. 

I can't do anything right, the things I love to do, I suck at, and I can't keep a relationship stable. One of my old best friends, I've known hims ince kindergarten hates me, and wants to beat me up next time he sees me, and there is no reason for it other then I'm weak. I found [this image](https://i.postimg.cc/fRSkt6cs/t9juvzjiz8gg1.png) a few weeks ago, and thought it'd be funny if I put it as my Discord bio, but guess what. I wake up today to see he had messaged me through my friend's discord telling me ""Remove that muslim from your bio"" ""Don't make fun of islam"" (He's muslim) so I did, 'cause I don't want any other stuff to happen. I nerver inteted to make fun of any religion, or mock anyone who follows said religion, but I get why he thoguht so. He only hates me. Once I was out with some of my friends, and he asked one of the people if he could come over, and when she said I was there he then changes his reply to ""I'll think about it"". He came anyway and we had a nice conversation for a few minutes, but what did I do to him?

I hate how I look, and the way I am. Having autism, and adhd fucking sucks, and I wish there was a cure for this. I want to make friends, but 'cause of the way I am, people have always bullied me, ridiculed me, and made fun of me all my school life. My nose wall is crooked so I've been breathing through my mouth for the past almost 17 years, so there is no turning back, I will forever be ugly.

1qszq4m,AITA for kicking someone out of the friend group,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I 17M have been apart of this friend group since October 2025 and it consists of myself, my girlfriend 17F our other friend 17F and my best friend 16M. We’ve all been friends since September but the friend group was fully formed in October, in early November another person joined the friend group,16F, I’ve known her for 5 years however my girlfriend and other friends only met her in September. 

I only knew this girl from school and she wasn’t really a friend of mine but we all grew fond of her company over last few months so we invited her into the friend group and usually we call on WhatsApp everyday from 7pm to around 1am and just talk about our days and the events and stuff we have planned and sometimes we get really philosophical when we talk. Here’s where the problem arises, her thought process is so utterly ridiculous and insane I have crashed out multiple times and have almost broken my iPad over (was gifted to me by a random lady I met on the street.. don’t ask), just to make things more simple for everyone let me just say what she had been saying and I quote ‘I only want to get married for money’, ‘Racism is sometimes okay’. 

Now personally these were the two that didn’t sit right with me but that’s a different story. Cut to the beginning of 2026, Me, my girlfriend who I’ll call Dani (not her real name Ofc) and Lori (the first girl I mentioned) and Brittney (who is the new girl I mentioned not their real names Ofc) were in a call on WhatsApp having our Money Marriage debate which we have once a week, long story short and for reasons I cannot outright say, the conversation got the point of religion and being humble then Brittney both indirectly and directly said that Lori’s parents are not religious or humble because they are separated, later in the week when Lori and Brittney attended the birthday party of one of our friends, Brittney looked at Lori’s mother up and down with disgust and walked off without acknowledging her despite Lori’s mother having cared for Brittney in her own personal struggles. 

Combined with this and her obscene behaviour we decided to kick he out of the group so I ,being the one who has known her the longest, send a very long paragraph to let her know why we all decided to kick her out. Once I did that everyone else in the gc explained to her their reasons for wanting her out. Then she proceeded to call everything a misunderstanding and refused to apologise to Lori for insulting her parents, then she told all of us to grow up despite being the youngest. Now we’ve been ignoring her when we see her and we just try to keep to ourselves.

Everyone I’ve told this story to says I’m not the asshole but I don’t really know. What do y’all think."
1qt29lh,Should I be worried about this behavior?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I have really strict parents. I have recently been closing my door to sleep more, which is something my mom ""doesn't like"" me doing in general. But many nights in a row Ive woken up to my door being opened, because I know some times my dad will come in at like 5-6 and try shaking me to wake up. But Ive been really weirded out because when I wake up and my door is opened Ill assume that my dad came in, opened the door, and tried shaking me awake, all while I was completely unconscious and dont remember any of it. So I attempted to confront my parents when I woke up, my mom came into my room and I asked her who keeps opening my door. and she just sort of said idk not me, then immediately got SUPER defensive about it; saying things like ""why do you even want it to be closed?"" or like""you know you arent supposed to close doors"" (obviously her saying this is meaningless since idgas and she wont notice it being closed in the middle of the night) and she kept being unusually defensive, and my dad heard and came in and I asked the question again and he didn't respond for a while, ignoring it and saying I ""shouldnt be giving him attitude"" (i literally just said ""whos been opening my door"" then eventually he answered saying its him trying to wake me up really early (which still makes me feel uneasy). then both him and my mom were REALLY angry at me, despite the fact that Ive stayed very calm and just asked a random question?? and this behaviour is very uncommon from them, Ive had crashouts about stuff before and they never get mad after something small.

1qt89l2,Am I ungrateful,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Im a 15M turning 16 and I wanted to know if im ungrateful. I live in middle to lower class household. My needs are provided for and genuinely I don't need anything and I'm grateful and understand how lucky I am to have those basic needs provided for me. The problem starts here, I have wants  but for as long as I can remember I never tell anyone bcoz genuinely I hate hearing we don't have money or you don't need it, it hurts a lot but I've always tried to be understanding but im getting tired of it. Like I have things I want to do too but cant seem to voice them out bcoz I don't wanna hear those words that would crush my spirit. I even stopped asking for things I need since im not so used to asking, things such underwear. recently I've been starting to music alot I spend most of the day with earphones on just playing but my love for music has honestly kept me grounded as in not losing mind since a bunch of other things have been happening lately. Lemme just get to the point I want a guitar and its been a while but since I've motivated to try doing anything and have already asked my mom but she's already treating it like if i learn to play something or be decent ill need it to make some money from it and I just want something else that can keep me from going insane and my mom is treating it as something I need to be really good at if she gets me the guitar but I just want something that can just be mine something I can sink hours into and just ignore the world while doing something i love. She's already complaining about the price of guitars and that just adds unwanted pressure that which im trying to not have as well as much as possible.

Honestly I probably just didnt say anythingin this post and im sorry im a bit scatter brained. 

Thank you for taking your time to read this under if you wanted plz give me advice on how to handle the situation and If possible tell em im ungrateful. If I am im sorry for wasting your time even more"

Her: tells me to clean up kitchen

Me: I go and do so, but leaves a drawer door slightly open, as well as the microwave door open and didn’t notice 2 pieces of rubbish

Her: yells and screams at me

Me: refusing to listen until she stops yelling but she won’t, but anyways tidy up the rest of the kitchen before attempt to leave the kitchen

Her: hits me cuz I’m not reacting how she wants

Me: goes to my room to get away from this crazy bitch

Her: follows and keeps yelling

Me: tells her this is why I don’t want to hang out with her (she asked me once why I don’t want to)

Her: more angry yelling, I better leave cuz apparently she doesn’t owe me anything blah blah blah, eventually goes shower

Me: peace for 10 minutes

Her: after shower immediately sprints to me room to keep yelling

Me: goes shower cuz she annoying af

Her: locks herself in her room. Still thinks what she did was right

All this time I’m telling her to stop shouting at me. I don’t fucking know what she wants, she could’ve gotten the same result by not shouting and making herself mad but still she does so. Literally braindead. And she keeps repeating the same thing over and over so there is no value to what she is saying whatsoever. Literal ragebait

1qss0jd,I think my roommate has been harassing me,Serious,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"For context: I’m 19m and in my second year of college

I live with three of my friends in an apartment, where we have our own rooms. We all occasionally engage in having drinks together or going to parties that are thrown around our college campus and regular college things.

One of my roommates, I had met shortly before starting university through a mutual friend, and we ended up hitting it off like crazy. We used to be very bi-acting with each other as a joke but we stopped because we agreed that it was for the better to keep the friendship. I regret the things I did back then with him even if it really was just giving him a peck once or twice.

We lived together last year, and he would always ask to cuddle with me and we would because I felt comfortable doing so since we had established that boundary previously and he would say ‘we can’t go back to those times.’

But recently, he has gotten a lot more bold, especially after a party he went to and came back absolutely hammered. He started cuddling all over me asking if he could kiss me and when I would tell him no, he would do it anyways. He would say if I did like boys, he would treat me right and better than anybody else would. He kept on calling me ‘so hot’ and would not get off of me and when I would move a bit further away from him he would close the gap again. Prior to this, he had been kind of cold to me and my other roommates and his drunk self ended up telling me it was because he couldn’t look at me without having sexual thoughts and he felt guilty about it. 

The next day, he apologized to me and I overlooked it, but this was not the first time something like this had happened, just the worst time. Now, any time we are hanging out with friends and drinking he will find a way to be touchy with me or sit on my lap and kiss my cheek, and still ask to kiss me on the mouth. He regularly asks me to cuddle with him and has laid down with me in my bed many times and laid on me without asking pretty much. 

I was recently being asked out by a girl, and my roommates knew that she was into me. Said roommate took the opportunity while we were drunk (after he showed all his love and affection!) to take that girl and one of my friends in private and badmouth me to them, which I was told by my friend who he was saying that stuff to. She also told me that she would tell the girl who was into me that she had competition with my roommate (aka it’s obvious that he wants me). 

I hadn’t talked to anybody about these incidents until a few days ago that my friend told me the things he said about me (which I think he is jealous), and having verbalized it made me so much more uncomfortable being around him. I try to find ways to be out of our apartment more so I don’t have to interact with him, and it is making me feel bad. Is this all in my head or is it justified?

TL:DR - my roommate drunkenly told me if I liked boys he would treat me right, kiss me on the mouth and cheeks without permission, and said he has sexual thoughts about me."
1qsi8fy,"Advice needed, tw family issues.",Serious,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Using a throwaway because tbh this would be embarrassing otherwise. I don't know where else to post this, so if anyone reading this has a sub better suited, please lmk. This is kinda long btw 

I'm going to preface this by saying that I'm 15, 16 in June and this has already happened before. This post may or may not be triggering for certain people, mentioning what I assume is a lack of care for mental health as well as family issues. I'll keep things as brief as possible, but tbh I'm kinda panicking because I don't know what else to do.

Basically, my parents want to send me away. Again. From Florida to Wisconsin, to live with my Grandma for a month. Sure, it sounds like a really fun and amazing trip/opportunity! But I'm already lacking so much stability in my life, I just want to be stable for a little bit. They've framed it like a punishment, which it is, they've shit talked me to hell to my Grandma, whom I've loved, and they want to essentially take all of my freedom away. I have no choice in the matter, and if I decide to not go, they've said they would send me to a mental hospital, again. I really don't want to go to either, but to choose the lesser of the two pains I'm gonna go with my Grandma. I'm going to have to miss my little sister's birthday, Valentine's day, the county fairs, etc. Which I had been looking forward to all of them. I don't have any friends I'd be leaving behind, because this year my mom had forced me to leave school for this year since my grades were doing bad.

Aforementioned, this has happened before. The silly story to go along with one of the reasons is they set cameras up in my room the hallway the living room etc. and took all our doors off (AGAIN) including the bathroom door (again). So in the middle of the night, I took all of the cameras down and buried them in the backyard so I could sleep peacefully. They proceeded to call the mental hospital on me and said a bunch of crap because burying cameras wasn't a valid reason to register me. They painted me as a violent person and massively suicidal (which at the time, no I wasn't) just to prove a point, I guess. They said they were 'helping' me.

Currently, they are sending me to my Grandma's because I 'sleep too much' and 'refuse to do anything.' Yeah. Valid I guess. I told them why, and gave them sources, as to why it was depression instead of me doing it to get a rise out of them but they're CONVINCED that I'm using it to harass them. My own therapist told them that what they were doing was most likely not helping, and after the appointment TO THIS DAY they keep saying how moronic she is and how I've manipulated her to say that. The thought that they might very well be the problem has genuinely not crossed their minds. I'm honestly really sad about all of this and they keep screaming and yelling at me and nearly bashing my door in but this really hurts because wdym my own family want to invalidate me like this. The way I'm writing this isn't shedding enough light on what they've done to hurt me this much because I don't want to exaggerate anything too far, but EVERY SINGLE DAY they yell at me and take things away. AND SURE, i get it. Or I'm trying to. Whenever I plead with them that I'm trying my best they refuse to believe it and answer with more yelling.

I really want to believe that they're doing everything to help but I told them it wouldn't help and  I've told them what might help. Which is THERAPY. thirty fucking minutes later they're still yelling  and telling me that I should just 'snap out of' my mental health issues.

I told them that my own teacher had my symptoms and they pulled me out of school before I could receive her help, either.

They pretend to be so supportive bringing me to psychiatrist this and therapist that and when they all say, and I quote, 'she have major depressive disorder' THEY DONT FUCKING LISTEN or believe its true. 'Oh that's just something the media's made up it isn't real lock in yap yap yap' FUCK YOU. 

I genuinely. Feel so insane. It isn't even funny. They snap at the smallest things and start taking my things away from me. Whatever will hurt me worst. Whatever is basically a lifeline to me. It used to be my emotional support stuffie (when i was younger) but now it's hobbies, crafts, but usually just all my electronics with a side dish of lecturing me for hours and me coughing up a sob story (every singlle time) and genuinely crying with my MOM to get my stuff back. Usually that consists of me trying to get her aware of mental health (because she usually takes it away when i sleep too much) and instead of  being actually valid or supportive about any of this which i think would help more (my therapist agrees and has told them) but nope they dont fucking listen. I sound like a broken record probably and I had to lock myself in the bathroom to write this :') so sorry for the maybe panic and caps and allat I just REALLY hate everything thats been going on. Any words appreciated or just the fact that you maybe read this far into my rant. I honestly just needed to get some of what's happening out.



tl;dr Theyre threatening to send me to a mental hospital if i dont go to my grandmas for a year and i dont wanna do either so im going to my grandmas anyway and theyre still invalidating my mental health. It's making me feel genuinely crazy."

1qryfow,"I love her, may you be my secret audience",Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Perhaps this is the right way—not giving her that letter, as it would only add to her burden. Even if no one believes me, I’m willing to hide it desperately. Even if everyone hates me, I’m willing to put myself in this position, to let everyone despise me. I’m not afraid, not in the least, because I’ve already done the bravest thing I’ll ever do in my life—talking to her, sending her messages. Each one required a courage I know I’ll never have again. Every glance I stole, every word I spoke, took the greatest courage I could muster. I don’t want to be selfish, not this time. It’s best if no one knows, not even my friends. That’s what brings me peace. Even if no one can see how deeply I truly love her, even if I know I can’t love her openly and without fear, I believe this is the most correct path.

Having fought for it is enough—even if just for a moment, a single glance, a small distance. I’m grateful. I’m grateful that she once liked me too. But I know all too well it’s impossible. I can only let myself hurt her, push her away. Yet I know this is right. I don’t want her to grieve for too long because of me, to let it become a haunting memory. I believe this is right. Even though my heart longs so much, loves her so deeply, yearns to be with her—to lie together watching clouds, to share so much more—I know it’s impossible. Truly impossible.

Even if no one can understand, even if everyone thinks my love is fake and questions me, I can’t speak the truth. There’s no way. I’m an outsider, a powerless little figure left with only myself, clinging stubbornly to my own conviction. I’ve deceived everyone—my parents, my friends, her. No one knows how much I love her; they all think I was just playing around. But I don’t need anyone else’s belief to validate my love. I don’t need it at all. My love is selfish; I only need to know that I’ve loved her. It’s enough that she can be happy.

I know all too well that I can’t have her, that I’m not worthy. So I desperately restrain every impulse, ending each day abruptly, afraid of truly stirring something. I love her—love her in a way no one understands. Every time I see her, my heart aches. How could I ever want to hurt her like this? But I have no other choice. She shouldn’t have liked me, and I shouldn’t have liked her. This way, everyone can be happy, everyone can forget me. I’m just a tiny insect, someone no one will remember. But I’m willing to hold onto every precious memory. Even if it’s just a moment, I’ll keep it. I’ll guard it joyfully, revisit it every day, and even if I can never see her again, I’ll preserve it. Because I know—this is mine, the only thing that belongs to me, about her.

I love you—a love you can’t understand, a love no one understands. I hope you’ll be happy, forever happy, untouched by the ripples of my existence. I hope you’ll never meet someone like me again, a fool like me. I hope you’ll meet someone who can truly love you—someone who can love you openly, without fear, without hesitation. "

One of my close friends (14F, ex-best friend now) said this to me during a casual roast battle a few months ago and i need to get it off my chest. She said a guy called Paras took her phone on the bus and typed that in for her. I used to hate Paras because he would tell me that I eat dogs and just throw around sinophobic slangs on snapchat. He’s also Indian, and I noticed in class that whenever his white friends make jokes about India being dirty he goes quiet, but when it’s about other ethnicities he doesn’t care. 

Note: I’m chinese, not Vietnamese 

I keep thinking about it everyday but I need to know the severity of the situation.

1qrlptl,How do I convince my dad to let me come out to my Christian family?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I(18f) am pansexual. I have been dating my girlfriend(17f) since I was 16 and she was 15(we're a year apart in school, and she's a year and a month younger than me). We've been together for almost a year and a half(will be a year and a half exactly on February 18th, but don't come at me for remembering that detail, ADHD brain).

The problem comes from my dad(56).

For context, I was born and raised in a Christian household, and I identify with the religion(please do not try and say I'm making a mistake, because that makes me feel like I am faulty and God made me wrong).

My entire family is also Christian, with different levels of intensity.

For some more context, I have three sets of grandparents. My paternal grandparents, my mom's mom and stepdad, and my mom's dad and stepmom. I love them all, but I will admit there is favoritism towards each of them based on how they treat my family(not getting into that because that's a whole can of worms). I am also an only child.

My grandparents(mainly my paternal ones) are getting old, and I genuinely see a future with my girlfriend, so it makes sense for me to want to introduce her to my family. She is a really sweet and genuinely caring girl, and her family has already accepted me as one of their own.

I brought the idea up to both of my parents.

My mom said ""be aware of how this will affect your relationship with your grandparents"", but didn't tell me to not say anything.

My dad on the other hand, gets mad whenever I bring it up.

I have a few rings that my girlfriend gave me(they're matching sets). One set are plastic Howl's Moving Castle rings(I have Howl's and she has Sophie's of you've ever watched the movie), and the other are simple black metal bands with glow in the dark hearts, two hands making a pinkie promise, and says ""I love you"" on the inside.

Everytime we go to a family event, my dad tells me to take off whatever ring I'm wearing.

For context I wear both on my left ring finger because that's the only hand they fit on.

He says ""you don't want them(my family) asking questions"".

I honestly could care less about what my family thinks, because several members(all on my mom's side) are rather toxic(particularly my biological maternal grandmother).

Whenever I say I don't want to, he get bent out of shape and starts getting angry with me.

I prefer to wear the rings because I have really bad social anxiety, and get overstimulated easily in crowds, especially on my dad's side because there are five little ones ranging from seven to a week or two old, and the rings usually keep me grounded because I fidget with them(something that helps my ADHD, which I am diagnosed with).

Another thing that makes me kinda upset is how my dad says stuff. I told him I wanted to tell my mom's mom and stepdad, and he said ""think about how this will affect mom's relationship with your grandmother"". That comment made me feel like he didn't care about what I thought...

I genuinely don't care what that set of grandparents think, because I struggle to like them sometimes(they've fat shamed me several times, and leave out my household often, not to mention my grandmother has been a horrible mother to my own mother). She has also said something along the lines of ""if you're gay you're going to hell"". This was when I was like 15.

She has two lgbtq grandchildren, neither of which have come out.

My other two sets of grandparents I don't really want to burn that bridge with, but I feel like they wouldn't get as bent out of shape over it.

Yes they're all religious(minus my mom's biological dad), but I doubt they would be cruel about it.

I genuinely don't know what to do, and I'm starting to get fed up with how my dad seems to not support me, despite my mom telling me otherwise.

I love my dad, but I can't help but be really upset with him over this.

Any advice is much appreciated, and I can answer any questions in the comments.

I may post and update if I get the courage to confront my dad more forwardly than I have."

1qrn601,Does she like me or am I delusional,Advice,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"We’re both in high school. I think she might like me, but I honestly can’t tell.

Why I think she might:

• She laughs at pretty much everything I say

• We have long text conversations sometimes

• I catch her looking at me in class sometimes (could just be normal glancing though)

• When we sit next to each other, we talk a lot (our teacher even separated us for talking too much, but we still talk if there’s a sub)

Why I think she might not:

• She laughs a lot with other people too

• I usually put a lot of effort into keeping conversations going, so maybe she’s just being nice

• I’m worried she might judge me because of some past stuff (don’t really want to get into it)

• She talks to almost everyone

• When we’re not actively texting, she takes a long time to reply

I genuinely can’t tell if she’s interested or just friendly. What do you think?"

The one that doesn’t pay attention to me is the brother of my boyfriend's sister and he comes here often but he always just stays on his phone and never initiates conversations with me. I try to initiate with b, but he just quickly stops paying attention and goes back to his phone. I don’t know if he’s forced to come over, but he really acts like it. Whenever I leave the room that he’s in, my family tells me to hangout with him. But yet when I try to, he doesn’t talk to me.I tried to go down to my room while he was over since he wasn’t talking and I was told to come back upstairs and hang out with him. I’ve talked to my family about this countless times, and they just disregard it and keep letting him come over. Most events that we go to together, he just stares at his phone but it's usually because this one friend isn’t here, (c) Now this friend, I enjoy talking to him more than the quiet one. I enjoy talking to him, but he’s not the type of person I'd wanna be friends with. There was one time, we (b and me) were at a new years party and we were all hanging out but (c) was gone, it was pretty quiet but i still managed to talk to the quiet friend to try and have some fun. A couple days later, the quiet friend was talking to the other friend talking about how boring it was without the (c), so basically disregarding every attempt I had to talk to him. Then the friend who gives a lot of attention to me (k), my mom doesn’t like me hanging out with. I’ve told her I've recently been growing apart from b and c. She says I'm getting too dependent on k and that I'm not willing to make new friends even though I am. my mom is forcing me to hangout with the friends that I don't even like. Every single day as time passes I feel like I'm growing towards someone else and that at school I could find new people to talk to but I don’t want to sound like I’m greedy for wanting to talk to new people, but I want a different situation that I’m already in. K always gives me advice that does help me and has been proven to help make me a better person than I used to be, but my mom is constantly always putting her down saying that she’s manipulative and has more life experience than her and knows what's best.

1qqfd2w,How can I stop being bullied?,Rant,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Ok so srry if this is long but idk where to rant,I don't wanna use a chatbot.



Ok so im currently in 7th grade,im the oldest in the class (14),and I have like 3 friends. From 1st to 3rd grade I was a very loud n sensitive child. When I started middle school I would act out and work was very hard for me to do so the teacher would sometimes yell at me,even force my classmates to ignore me and pretend like i dont exist,so through the years I became very shy and now I barely speak,only when the teacher or somoene asks me themselves. I never really had good grades,I always struggle in physics,math,geography and such subjects. But in art,english and computer class im one of the best ones,I recently was 4th in the english competition. I've been bullied alot,especially for my looks and skills in gym class since I grew up very chubby,now im skinny-fat(??) and trying to lose weight even though im failling miserably because I hate going outside and whenever no one sees im sneaking food in my room and binging. My class is basically a bunch of racist,homophobic and sexist boys,the girls all have iphones and they have 100 boyfriends and they always bully ppl. They say the N word everyday like its sm funny,they say stuff like ""women are witches"" and shi like that,but the teachers don't even say anything! Im labeled as the weird one bcs Im quiet,I have naturally dark eyebags,I listen to kpop and like anything mainly western. I tried to come out last year in 6th grade (keep in mind im balkan so its a very conservative country) and it was okay at first because I left little hints in conversations,but when the guys asked me directly one day they just bullied me. My mom isn't helpful either,she thinks its ""just a phase"" and that im brainwashed or sm. My mom and step-dad fight almost every week and its always bcs of me and he thinks Im just lazy on purpose and that im hiding stuff because im in my room all the time. My brother and sister (both older than me) always bully me too and my brother always pokes me in the stomach,even though I said im uncomfy millions of times and my mom just says that its ""sibling love"". Now,I started hiding in the stalls in the bathroom every break so I could get away from the bullying but even in class,my classmates always tell the teacher im sleeping,even though im not. My face is naturally droopy and goes a little downwards. Idk what to do,I don't wanna tell my mom or my step dad bcs they will just insult me more abt it,but telling the teachers isn't worth it bcs they will just bully me more abt it. I also forgot to add that they also bully me for my akwardness,I always daydream in class so whenever I get called by the teacher I just look dumb and I hate it. I hate how I look,I hate my language and I hate my voice. Sorry if this is cringe,I js wanted to vent and im trying to not use AI anymore. Pls give me advice on how can I stop them bcs I hate attention. Im sorry if this is against the reddit rules thingy,I can delete this."

https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/s/dQIaNDXmm7

Well, another thing about her is that she very often ruins my whole day's plans because she thinks of something to do and me and my father have to do everything her way. It happens about once a week. We have a plan, and she starts yelling about her plans etc. I keep telling my father to do something about it, to argue with her and maybe for once just not agree with her but he won't listen. 

Today, me and my father were supposed to go to the gym as we do every 2 days and start a small renovation of my room, and she stepped in and said she wanted a trip to IKEA. For a couple hours. This would ruin our whole day's plan and I argued that we had plans which she knew of and as usual she's destroying everything. And as usual my father gave in. So I said I'm not going. I mean if she's ruining my day as usual which she knows of then fuck her, I won't give in too. So after a lot of yelling and door slamming from her, she left with my father. My whole day ruined. My mood ruined. Now they came back and I find out that I'm banned from going from the gym, which I was told by my father. God knows what else she thought of. Fuck her, I'll go. I'm worried about leaving, that she'll take something like my PC from my room and say I'm banned from that, but what choice do I have? 

I'm supposed to meet my adult half-sister tommorow (who thankfully has a different monther) and I wonder whether I'll be banned from that as well. Fuck my mother, I'll go.

This has happened on Saturday as well, I had my whole day planned and she said that she doesn't care and we're going to a city an hour away just because. I gave in after a huge argument that time, so I was still upset about it and that's why I didn't do so today.

I argue with my father a lot because of her, mostly it looks like this:
Me: ""She does it every time, just don't give in at least one time""
""I don't want to argue with her, just calm down sometimes""
""Wtf you don't wanna argue with her, you know I'm right and she's destroying our plans""
""I dOn'T wAnNa arGuE wiTh hEr""
blah blah blah.

I know he knows I'm right, but he won't stop giving in. I kind of understand him because sometime between when I was 9 and 14 they didn't talk to eachother at all for like 3 years while still living in the same house, wouldn't eat dinner together etc. I don't care. She's an entitled childish bitch and it's clear to us both, tho he won't admit it. I can manage not talking to her and I don't care. But he won't accept it. Fuck this all

Thai is notoriously popular with the ladies. Last year Thai and my friend went out for five months and broke up because Thai liked a bunch of girls insta posts and was being a major asshole towards bri. now slip forward like a year and my friend develops a crush on Tonga 16(M). She’s liked on and off since EIGHTH GRADE! and he is also supa popular with the ladies. They tried to talk for about a weeks, and he told her he didn’t want to keep talking because he found another girl, which he ended up dating for 3-4 months and broke up around halloween bc she cheated on him since he didn’t want to sleep with her. About one month after they broke up, bri and tonga started to text again, and this time Tonga was superrr interested. BUT! … BRI STARTED TALKING TO THAI AS WELL!!!! and this time he initiated and promised to be a better man. and he’s also acting amazing and actually is being a better man for her. Today there was a rival basketball game at bris school versus tongas school and they saw each other there! for the first time in a longggggg time, and he walked her to her car, and they fist bumped, and the giggled, and he texted her after and said “i’m glad you made it home safe, that’s some precious cargo” bri is the precious cargo btw. ALSO, thai asked bri to be his valentine, and right after they numped nasties. He leaves for college soon that’s the only reason bri is even continuing this little rendezvous with Thai. but now she is like hella conflicted since tonga entered the picture she doesn’t know who to pick, me and my friends voted for tonga, we don’t fw thai at all.

The worst part is I do it to my damn self.

The girl was and maybe still is super into me I keep denying her even though I want her and she checks every box but that’s a story of its own. (She did nothing wrong my body just rejects being around her for some reason)

I have friends I just barely talk to them or make plans.

My coworkers are all older than me and though I love them we can’t rlly hang.

I love my parents but I stay in my room bc I’d just rather do that.

And the only person I really talk to is my ex (we chill) from my old school 4 hours away.

And the cherry on top is I practically refuse to pick up my Bible and I don’t know why.

And maybe the problem is spiritual but another big thing I think is motivation. I just kinda do it to myself and I want a girlfriend SO BAD but it’s Horrible bc I won’t let myself. I wanna be in a relationship and forgive me reader but I have a high drive and I’m going berserk latley bc I want it SO bad but I basically refuse to let myself have it even if I could get the time of day from a girl. I just never have the motivation to do anything and take charge in my life.

1qpvl6a,I think I miss her.,Relationship,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"It’s hard to find someone at my school who would understand what happened, but this is something that’s coming really really deep from the heart. I just can’t bottle it up anymore, so I’m gonna vent in the only place that might offer me some guidance and sympathy.

It started Nov 29, my Birthday. This girl who I barely talked to, who had ghosted me because she was sick and forgotten to respond to my message, sent me a “Happy Thanksgiving.” I’ll call her C. C and I met in this Model UN Conference (if you check my profile lol you can see my rants about it), and C was pretty, a little timid, and we bonded over our shared long wait in line for feedback from our chairs.

I got her number after the conference wrapped up, and I wasn’t expecting it to become anything major. After all, I got instagrams from other people and since she only had snap, I got her number. We talked for a little, then we stopped for a week. I thought it was whatever, put her out of my mind. That’s when she texted me on November 29.

I remember making some steak while texting her. Basic stuff like what’s her hobbies, her favorite shows. She didn’t really have any, like it was either multiple or none at all. Her favorite color though was blue, like her eyes. I think the thing that got me interested in wanting to know her better was when the conversation didn’t feel so one sided and it felt like she gave an actual vested interest in me.

We kept talking after that, calling a bunch and even facetiming until 10, when she had to sleep because of her strict parents. The age gap between us was one year, but I’m a young senior and she’s a sophmore. Maybe that might’ve been redflag no. 1, but in any case, we talked alot.

Calling me every morning almost, just to talk to me randomly. Facetiming at night to just talk, for me to stim about “i’m not cute anymore” by illit and “what’s up you tu-tu-tu-tube” But I think what made me keep coming back to talk to her was how she like understood me, sort of. We both had problems, where she had problems with her relationships because it felt like everyone was fake and just acquaintances to her. Maybe I felt the same way, that no one could understand me and that she saw me for who I truly was.

We created this giant document on google where we wrote a half-written story and texted when she didn’t want to use snapchat. I remember distinctly this one night she snuck on her macbook and used it to text me until 2am. She’s a pretty heavy sleeper so I felt super special in that moment.

And she would call me all the time. I’d be working on my AP Econ video project with my friends and she would call me while I was in the library planning, or walking around this college campus trying to find a place to record a video. (We’re highschoolers, but my friends wanted to record on the college campus because it felt more downtowny for that business vibe we were going for.)

Fastforward to the beginning of our breaks for winter. She went off to some place in Montana for skiing and I went to italy for the winter break. We would text all the time, trying to call as much as we could despite the apparent distance and timezone issues. I’d wake up at 2am just to text her when she’s free, and would silently call her so I wouldn’t wake up my family.

Then one night, January 1st right after her birthday. We had this really deep talk about us. Our future, how we saw ourselves. What we thought of each other. I just blurted out randomly that I think I liked her, that she was funny and pretty, that she saw me for who i was and I felt seen and heard whenever I was around her. We hadn’t hung out at all, so just blurting this out was kinda stupid since it’s been online. Mind you, we live 20 minutes away from one another so it’s not like it was impossible to hang.

Then, she said that we could try. And I felt all giddy and happy and jeez. Looking back, I was so immature for that. I’d barely known this girl and I was already confessing my feelings to her.

We slowly kept texting, calling and I guess falling for each other. We’d send each other these snapchat reels about relationship shi and we would talk about how we’d meet and talk and hold each other. It’s cringe but I felt so loved by her.

But once her school started back up, she grew distant. She wouldn’t call me all the time, or bother me at all. She wouldn’t text me until she slept, and slowly she stopped saying she loved me, and I’d stop getting a good morning or goodnight text. She’d post on her story, her hanging out with her friends and then tell me how busy she was, that she had no time and she was sorry.

I think I started to realize the gaps and holes in the relationship, when she started to talk about how she was so distant because of her school, her commitments and not trying to fix it to make us work. I think we were at very different times in our lives. It got worse once she got a concussion over MLK break when snowboarding. Then she just altogether barely talked to me.

But yesterday, I was taking a nap and I woke up to find a voice message to me. She told me, “I wish you well, and that I hope you find someone better than me, someone to create the same spark in your eyes that I did. You deserve better, and yeah.” that’s a TLDR of what she said.

What’s worse is that it happened all over a voice message, that she didn’t tell me a last I love you, that the last time we talked she didn’t even say I love you, but “You know I do.” I didn’t get to respond, a last word. And what’s worse is it was all during a volleyball game she was taking photos for journalism.

I talked to her best friend, who had NO idea that it happened and I asked her to send C a last word. I asked C why we couldn’t be friends, why after everything we’ve been through and all the laughter and trauma we shared, we couldn’t go back to being friends. I told C how much I cared for her, how much she meant to me. And then, I told her I wish her the best, that she goes where she wants to go and does great things.

And her response to me? The same thing she told me over voice message.

I feel. Angry? I feel sad. I feel disappointed. I feel like all my emotions meant nothing. That I was just another guy she’s gonna forget about. That I’m never going to have the same connection that I just had. I know it’s going to happen again, but it’s hard to know that someone you care about just upped and walked out of your life.

Today, she unadded the playlist we made with 10 hours worth of our favorite songs. She unadded me from snapchat, and her best friend told me that C doesn’t want her (the best friend) talking to me at all, despite her (the best friend) wanting to stay friends.

Thanks for reading this, and hopefully you can help me find solace, or explain why she left me. I still read back the google document we made with all of our texts and rants. But I know I have to move on. It hurts. It felt like I had met a soulmate and instead, I was js another bump in the road for her. I loved her, but I think I’m mature enough to where I can move on without sounding like a desperate ex by begging her to come back. I’ll read every comment and reply to each. I’ll share the voice message later, but I feel like that’d be doing a disservice to her privacy and mine. In any case, that’s my story."
1qpqhf3,One way to confess to a girl u like in school and ask her out (just a suggestion don't judge too harshly),Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Send her a handwritten love letter and ask a friend classmate or slip in near her somehow. Love letter esp handmade ones are so cute and is a rare sight. It shows that you've actually bothered to put at east some effort. This if u don't wanna say it face to face make sure to decorate it in a cute envelope. (try origaming one :). It will def be smth she would keep even she says no it's still such a cute gesture. Or u could not sya who it's from but *inset number or *meet me at this place time and date. U could put a tj sweet on like like:
1) I think you're really great. I don't know how say it to you in person but would it me OK if u came out with me *insert love hearts doodles, colouring and stickers,
Extra points if u get a bouquet or even a single flower is really cute.
I know this is really old fashioned but I think smth like this, true and pure honesty is really rare and worth valuing. Most people just send low effort texts which are so dry esp if u start with 'hey'. (better if its spelt hai :)) 
Be HONEST a girl does not like show offs. Do not try to impress her about what u did xyz but tyr to learn more about her ask her questions about her preferences hobbies and lifestyle and try to find smth u have in common. U can really get talking then.
Good luck xxx *we love the x and the xoxo (stands for hugs and kisses and it's really cute if it comes from a guy trust)

1qpf66j,A (Not) New digital Diary,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"It’s me again and from now on I will write on this app called “notes” where I’m safe again (I hope so). The reason why I switched to there it’s because one of my annoying sisters, (the young one) decided it’d be better to invade my privacy. Which she says “it’s for good reasons” but she will end up using them against me to bully me anyway.

This one on the other hand is different. She saw the diary, but she never bullied me on them. I’m not mad about it, I’m mad that she went there she and my big sister took a picture of them or let’s say my little sister did and gave them to the old one. By the way keep in mind I never knew all of that I only did because my middle sister told me in private that the were “scavenging” through my stuff, I hate how she deceived me into thinking that I have my own privacy I hate her so much. If there’s a thing I like about her is her dark intelligence and her instinctive manipulation she knows a lot of tactics even though she never learned anything about them like NEVER not even a dark psychology video not a book NOTHING  she was born that way.

The best part is now that I am gonna write my diaries in the notes app, I have more security like I have my Face ID lock on it it’d be nearly impossible to get into 

Lessons learned:

1- there is no such thing called “privacy” in this house and if there’s it would highly mean you will get discovered soon or got discovered before you even know it

2- if my little sister ever got curious, then it’s over

3- it’s better preferred to hide things like diary note close so it’d be impossible to find 

4- never trust anyone (and I mean by “anyone” is my old sister, my young sister, my mom)

5- be careful of what you do and what you hide and where you hide it. Secrets shall be hard to find "
1qp7qss,"Girl [16 F] I was/am talking to keeps giving me [16 M] these mixed signals, and idk what to do.",Relationship,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Hi,

I’ve been talking to this girl for about a month now (we’re both high school sophomores). We started talking Dec. 18th (only remember because it was my last day before break and my friends and I went into the city). Since then, we’ve been texting on snapchat every day (sometimes on messages too). For context, we go to different schools. I go to a private boarding school (subtle flex 💪) and she goes to public school in her town.

Recently, she’s been super non-responsive and leaving me on opened (on Snapchat, that means she reads it but doesn’t reply). As far as I know, I haven’t been dry (our convos used to be long, and both of us actually added to them). I usually respond when I see her message (not instantly, but I don’t ignore it on purpose because that feels jerky). If I’m with friends and we’re not mid-conversation, I’ll put my phone down between messages.

Up until like two weeks ago, I thought it was clear we both liked each other. We were even talking about stuff we wanted to do together (mini golf for example). But now it’s weird. She’ll start a convo, I’ll reply, and *then* she’ll leave me on read.

Her birthday was last week. I texted her around 9 AM: “Happy Birthday🥳 Hope you have a great 16th!” She opened it a few minutes later and didn’t respond until that evening. I wasn’t expecting a full convo, but leaving a birthday message on opened felt kinda wild. When she finally replied, she said, “Thank you❤️! Today was great! Guess what happened…” I said, “Glad you had a good day! What happened?” and again, left on read until the next day, when she sent one message saying “my friend did smt rly nice for my b-day.”

Is that not weird?/

Sometimes when she finally replies after hours, I’ll joke like “omg you’re alive,” and she hearts it, laughs, and says something like “lol yeah sorry, just doing some work.” For 12 hours?? 🤦‍♂️

I know she probably just lost interest, but I really want to know if I did something wrong or if this is just a her problem. Not even sure this is the right subreddit, but my friends are useless, so please lmk!

1qpcn15,Is my best friend just a rebound for his current gf?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So my best friend: E, has recently started dating a mutual friend T, after softly rejecting my hg: C. Now C and T are best friends, and 2 weeks before she started dating my boy E: she had gotten rejected by a guy that she had liked for essentially a year - in which E had helped her get over him, since E is just like me, and he's able to be emotionally vulnerable and gives people advice.

Apparently they got together bc they sat outside E's house in T's car, and they got very personal and intimate, and they realised they and feelings for each other.

  
They've been together for just under 2 weeks now, but are already speeding through the motions and not even waiting until Valentines day to get freaky. And so I'm worried that my best man is being used an emotional rebound.

I think that their personalities match, it's just how for someone who has a history of adapting to her situations slowly: quickly switched up onto E: a emotionally comforting guy. I've been in 3 relationships, and idk, it's like my spidersense it being triggered.

I also don't want them to split bc the ""honeymoon phase"" (I hate that term) is over. Knowing E, he'll try to keep it going, but idk abt T.

1qp4na8,What are signs a girl is into you?,Relationship,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"What are signs a girl is into you?

So I’m 15M. I’ve never dated, and don’t want to currently. But there are two girls. One is my best friend, She has been my bsf since 8th grade, and she’s sending me reels how we should kiss, how i should get the hint that she likes me, how i should take her out on valentines day. She just says it’s a joke, and i find it awkward and frankly disgusting how she keeps on pushing my boundaries even though I do not like her. She is just as platonic as any of my friends are. But there’s this other girl. Let’s call her R (i’ve had a bad past with girls who’s names start with R lmfao)

So we started talking at the end of 8th, and I told my bsf X about her. I had a crush on her (but don’t have one on her now).We talked a lot, and we ended up in the same section in 9th. We didn’t talk much physically in 9th, but we were still friends. But in 10th, i started to get included in her group. So it’s not like me and her group weren’t friends. So R’s group had J and K, while i was friends with another girl D in 9th and 10th. I was already friends with R’s group, but when D friended them, we all started hanging out and we’re really close friends. Still, I feel more of a connection with R even though i have talked less to her comparatively than D and J. She greets me every day she sees me with a wide smile and blown out eyes like “Hiiii” and often we’re in sync so we say it at the same time in exactly the same way. She doesn’t greet her friend group the exact same way though. I guess we started bonding more after our group participated in the class show in a play. She borrows books from me, and asks if she can annotate them, and she’s regularly busy, so she doesn’t reply often. But she always replies to me, and she specifically tells me and clears time so she can reply to me. We click pics together, and she wrote on my shirt on shirt signing day (XoXo). And she’s like really pretty. We have a lot in common i guess. So Am I reading too much into her behaviour because I have experienced similar behaviour from people who have a crush in me, or am i just delulu?"
1qnvxe7,I'm getting sick of this.,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"A couple of years ago, I had a bunch of issues with my parents and how they were never open about decisions and things. It was more specific than that and kind of dumb.

But from then on I took away that I can't really have a say anything or express an opposing opinion other than trivial things without getting a  fiery response or being completely shut down. 

So from then on I've just been doing a hings they want me to do without complaints or saying anything even if I thought it didn't matter or just a bad way of doing things. 

It just feels one sided all the time, so much so to the point that I hide a portion of myself and always keep my guard up around them. Recently, mom joking told me that she was leaving and never coming back. 

And while still looking at my phone I just told her ""ok"" she was shocked by my answer despite asking the same or similar question before with a similar response. It's not like I had a say in any of their decisions so why try now. Id simply adjust to and mold myself to it like I've always have. 

She was hurt by my response and it turned into this recurring conversation about how don't love them which I do care about them to a degree but I've never felt really attached them because of my distrust of them. 

It's basically just been me trying to explain myself to them (particularly her) without opening up. And she's been pretty disatisfied with my explanation of ""I don't love or care for anyone"" which is only partially the truth. 

One thing that really made me understand just how little my opinion in their choice mattered was my 15th birthday. I Didn't want to do anything for my birthday and I was very vocal about that. 

Despite my complaints, she made me do an escape room. Which I told her at least 3 times I didn't want to do. But once we there I realized that they were really gonna make me do this. I just accepted it, didn't say anything, and hated it. 

They asked me how it was and I told them how much I hated it and they simply brushed it off as I'm closed minded and don't like to try new things. 

But I had multiple reasons why I didn't want to do that thing particular. I was tired, depressed, lonely, and genuinely had like 15 other major problems in my life and piling on uncessary ones as ""fun"" was the last thing I fucking needed. "
1qnwmsm,"M16, my mother made me hate myself.",Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"M16 here. Idk why I'm here, I guess I need someone to hear me out and posting here feels like the easiest way.

My mother has always been making me feel bad about myself, criticizing everything I do and making fun of my insecurities. When I told her about one of my insecurities she just laughed me off and was making fun of it for the next 2 days.

I stand wrong, my laugh is irritating, I look weird. Hearing this kind of shit every other day made me hate myself more and more to the point where I cut off from any social interaction (for example not taking part in conversations on meet ups, spending time in my phone instead which I also hate myself for), have no confidence and never open up to anyone. I have learned to keep everything to myself, even such basic things as niche hobbies because even though they bring me some joy that she's killing I feel like I would be considered weird or idk... judged. Yeah that's the word. I feel judged on every step and breath I take and it's making me feel worse and worse.

When I try to do something to be any better than I was, as soon as she notices she finds a way to make me feel bad about it too. 

There are many things I could say that show how terrible of a person she is, not only hurting me but my father also, but I felt I had to share this today. "

I’m just tired of it all. Seriously, I can’t even just be sad because I have to smile, who said I have to smile? Just let me be sad, I deserve to feel sad, I hold everything in all the damn time, it’s just not possible to “keep your head up and smile” all the time. And my mom thinks I have nothing to be sad for, as if she understands, we’re two different people. This is just difficult man. I say anything in a slightly different tone, I’m rude.

And I don’t want to be an extrovert or talk to people all the time, I just wanna be me, and not talk. I don’t care if I’m not approachable, if I’m uncomfortable approaching people, what makes you think I want to be approached? And then I’m bashed for staying in my room all the time, sorry that I’m not talkative and you are, those things just don’t mesh well together.

For some reason I have to smile all the time or I’m unapproachable. For some reason, my resting face makes it seem like I don’t care. For some damn reason it seems like they WANT me to be an extrovert… no shade to extroverts but extroverts talk too much sometimes. I just like silence and my own company. I can think better with silence.

1qmyu9e,He says he doesn’t want a relationship but I’m so confused and need outside opinions,Relationship,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"Hi Reddit I genuinely don’t know if I’m losing it or if this is actually mixed signals so please be honest with me. There’s a TL;DR at the bottom so please don’t skip my post 😔 

I’m 17F and I like this guy (17M). We’re friends and we see each other literally every day except Saturday, so everything feels really intense and hard to separate.

He never told me he doesn’t want a relationship, but when we were teaching at another school and asking students for feedback, one kid wrote something like “my friend thinks you’re cute” and his response was that he doesn’t want a relationship right now. The kid was a freshman so that probably mattered but it still got stuck in my head.

What’s confusing is that after that he keeps acting really close with me. He teases me a lot, makes sure I’m looking when he’s doing something funny, invites me to things like his band competition and church stuff, and just includes me all the time.

We’re around each other so much that he even changed his schedule so he wouldn’t be near a group of girls who were bullying me and so we could have the same classes. That feels like… not nothing?? Like I don’t think you do that for just anyone.

Also when we first met he HATED people touching him, especially his hair. Now he’s totally fine with me touching his hair, playing with it, and little random touches here and there, which he doesn’t really let other people do.

On top of that, his best friend asked me if I liked him and I panicked and lied and said I liked a different guy (WHY did I do that). She said “hmmm okay” in a way that made me feel like she definitely did not believe me.

And this might just be my insecurity talking but he’s really attractive. Like could literally date almost anyone. Because of that I keep wondering why someone like him would ever want to date me, especially since I’m overweight, and that just makes me second guess everything even more.

So now I’m stuck. He says he doesn’t want a relationship but his actions don’t feel totally platonic either. I can’t tell if he’s just a really friendly person once he’s comfortable, if he likes the attention, or if there’s actually something there but he’s not ready for anything.

I don’t want to cross boundaries or assume things that aren’t real but I also don’t want to gaslight myself into thinking I imagined all of this.

Please tell me if I’m overthinking this or if this would confuse other people too.

TL;DR: Guy says he doesn’t want a relationship but we see each other almost every day, he changed his schedule to avoid people bullying me and to have classes with me, invites me to stuff, teases me, and lets me touch his hair even though he used to hate that. His best friend suspects I like him. I’m very confused and insecure."

I lay in my room, bedrotting any chance I get, I dont have any real friends I guess you could say my boyfriend is my best friend, he feels sorry for me, he is a popular, outgoing  guy whos never been bullied whilst ive been the opposite my whole live, its hard to talk to him and he just wouldn't understand, im looking for a job now to try to be more social even though I spend most nights crying myself to sleep about how miserable and pathetic I dont know if im depressed, my parents are polish and i doubt they would understand considering the have a more traditional and „olden days” take on things. my mum does try to help me but her advice is just to „go take a walk” „do some exercise you’ll feel better.” truth is i dont think i will ever feel better. im worried i will grow and watch my sisters get married and have a happy life while i stand there still, being to much of a coward to take my life. my dad is who is stopping me, he recently heard on the news a young girl killed herself around my age and he proceeded to talk about how selfish it was and how the parents must be feeling. i dont want to hurt my parents but i also feel like thats just something i tell myself, i know i would never actually do it, im scared of what comes after. i just want it to end i have no energy in me. i started smoking weed in october of last year thinking it was a good idea, it worked, i didnt think about any of my problems for those few hours i was high so i continued it. i’m not addicted, i would buy it but if someone offers ill take it. god, i just genuinely envy my sister, she’s independent and i wish i was more like her. anyways, i love to hear your thoughts"

I've been in 3 relationships and 2 flings with girls, all without complaints. However my homegirl keeps sending me femboy memes and I'm lowkey starting to see the appeal, but I've never had a crush on a man in my life.

This all climaxed a few hours ago, when I was at my friend's birthday and she decided to invite her other friend group to mix the two for the evening, and there was a genuine femboy there. Not trans but the makeup n shit was done so well I thought he was a girl before my friend clarified that it was in fact a *he*.

Idk, just kept catching myself looking at him. The more and more I think about it, the more I find myself *not* shying away from it.

1qmhje9,How did you guys experience relationships in school? And how would you react if you were in my situation?,Rant,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"So here's my story.   
It all started at the ending of my 9th grade(like at the start of 2024). At that time, most of the students in my class went for practice dance, music and other things for the upcoming cultural festival. So only a handfull of students were in the class (including me). Out of boredom, we all agreed to play a game of truth or dare, and you all know where the final question lands and the victim happens to be myself. I was too anxious to reveal my crush (she was one of best friends who started to hang out with me since 4th grade) so i gave t like a puzzle for them to find it out (most of them found out as i wasn't that much subtle with my feelings). After a few classes, one of the people who found out decided to tell it another oblivious one which she then gain told it the my crush(let's keep her name as Hana). Then after that she confronted me, and after a few minutes of talking(i.e, teasing), both of us confessed and she said that we would get together after our school. To which i agreed.  
  
An year and a half later

Before my 10th grade final exams, one of my friends reached me and asked me if i still had a crush on Hana. To which i replied that i still had it, told me that last time they talked to Hana, she said she doesn't have any any feeling towards me (It threw me off for a moment). So, i started pondering wtf was going on. And after a few months, I confronted her, asked her about the change in feelings but she replied like the past incident never happened and said she only saw me as a best friend (she obviously didn't say the reason) . This deeply confused me and was left questioning. Did I do anything wrong?

If yes can you point it out to me ?  

Thank you for seeing this post."
1qm7pzg,Being tbe crush of your friend crush sucks,Relationship,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"No insults just give some honest opinion.
I'm honestly feeling like shit right now, there is two part of this post and second part it's even most confusing to me.

Here is the thing, I have this friend that we are going to call Tina, I knew for a couple of years now, she consideres me a best friend I don't actually agree on that because I could see she was pretty immature compared to me, so it was really hard to get a good level friendship but I think now we are more stable despite there being still some gaps.

(First part)
Anyway at the beginning of last year this friend gets with a guy, he was my classmate in middle school but we mantained in good terms and still talk sometimes. I knew he wasn't the smartest, but knowing her I decided not to say anything about it because he was still a nice guy, overall they had pretty much the same way of thinking so I thought that maybe I didn't liked him too much, but they might have been good for each other and let her have her peace.

4 months later they broke up and once the emotional wound healed a bit, I was with this friend at a restaurant talking about that period. She told me, that he told her all about his ex crushes and past girlfriends and even came up that he liked a lot o people we know.
It was a fun clime so in the laughes I decided to tell a story about his little brother tryng to make us kiss from when he liked me all the previous year, assuming she already knew about that.
Well she didn't, and despite Tina was still trying to keep the fun moment, I could see she was kinda shocked by the thing.
Only after that I regret telling her that story and never brought up that thing again.

(Second part)
2 months ago another friend of ours tried to set up Tina and one of his friend that we are going to call Mike, during a group hang out with different people.
Unfortunately Tina fell immediately but Mike didn't like her the same way.

They decided to stay friends and Tina said to me she didn't liked him anymore and out of nowhere she tried to set up me with him. To be honest I didn't thought about him at all in that sense, I have to admit tho, that he is indeed cute but we exchanged like 4 phrases and I saw him twice so I hadn't much to say.
So after she insisted to be the cupid of situation I agreed on getting to knowing him but I wanted try first as a friend, with no pressure and then if something was meant to spark was something we would have dealt with later.
We hang out all togheter with the rest of the group plus Mike, first thing he was always next to me and Tina hinted all the time about a possible ""us"", then she made the weird thing of leaving to let us talk supposedly; she was literally going nowhere but wondering the streets alone, and the rest of the group stayed with us.

Anyway I understood she still liked him, and I had to talk with other 3 people just to put togheter what really happened, guess what?He liked me from the beginning, he told her despite knowing her feelings, and she wanted to see both us happy.
When I found out about this I decided that I wanted to immediately cut this thing before anything happened, leaving the door open just for a friendship.
I know she was being good, but I know she would suffer and I would feel like a complete asshole for life doing this to a friend.
I talked with her about it, she understood but asked not to tell him that I knew everything and so I have yet to talk with him.
I'm so confused, I feel honestly so bad but at the same I can't control who they get a crush on and now I have also to think about how to explain everything to him kindly. This is such a mess.
I just don't want to be the one that has the attention of the people she likes again, and knowing her I don't want her to feel insicure about it or resent me because of this."
1qm5rsh,gang I highkey feel guilty for reporting my friend to my school,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"He's been kinda creepy towards this girl in our grade, and it's started to seem like harassment, because she told him she wasn't interested, and last night at our school dance, he went up to her and asked, ""kiss or slap?""

And before he had texted her to come over, and when she asked why, he said ""why don't you come and find out?"" (WE ARE 13)

I just sent an email to the school counselor because of it, but like, bro, I feel bad even though I know I did the right thing, at least I think I did.

EDIT: editing to answer a couple of questions I have been asked so far  
\- Did you talk to the girl before reporting?  
No, I have only been able to talk to her friends, but they are in support.

\- Why haven't you smacked him yet?  
He's stronger than me, vewy scawy

\- You could've talked to him first?/why didn't you talk to him first?  
I tried, but he doesn't see the problem, and I am not qualified to give him that guidance

\- Would your friendship be ruined?  
I don't particularly care, if its ruined, its ruined, if it isn't then I will monitor him to see if he pulls anything like this and report if I need to. Someone said this is manipulative, I agree, but I don't care. If being manipulative means potentially keeping more people safe, good."

I have quite an intense schedule: wake up at 4-5 depends how much homework I get, do said homework and eat, practice piano 7:00-7:45 before I head out for school. After school, I have a snack, shower, practice violin, dinner and practice again. I get to bed around 22:30-23:00.

im getting 4-6 hours of sleep per night and it’s slowly destroying me. If i even miss one day of school, it disrupts my balance and I can’t keep up.

meanwhile, I also have figure skating to do (my mum says I must do a sport). Usually Saturdays are my rest days as I have skating and my violin/piano lesson on Sundays.

shes planning to get me to go to skating on Saturdays too and on weekday mornings. i am not a morning person and these practices are 5:15-7:15 or 7:15-8:15.

when I talk to her abt it, she just nods along pretending to listen and tells me to “just cut my practice time”. Im already not doing much practice so this is not an option. I told her this and she was like “well thats too bad because you will always need to exercise”. But I am! I have PE at school and skating 1-2 times a week not to mention the conditioning I do for skating.

Quite a long rant, just had to get it off my chest.

Edit: not that related but she also compares me to other ppl such as:

”Not to compare, but \*my frd\* always \*takes such good care of her mum, works so hard, is grateful for what she gets etc\* why can’t u be more like her”

I completely agree and I’m so happy people are finally starting to understand and show awareness but i literally haven’t been taught anything else. im also a little overweight and i’m trying to lose weight but another reason why i’m scared to lose my virginity is because i dont wanna be called fat or ugly or anything. what if i lose weight, but my stretch marks are still there and i get called gross for them? there’s so many things contributing to the fear. also, you’re supposed to bleed when you lose it??!! isn’t that how you get an std?????? i’m terrified."

Hello, 

This is an informational email about a conversation I had with your swimmer, \[my name\], last night after practice. 

In summary, \[name\] approached me after practice to have a discussion about her mental health. She explained to me that she felt extremely under pressure to the point that she was seeking a coping mechanism to handle it. \[name\] mentioned to me last night that in years past, she resorted to cutting on her arms and that she does not want to make the same mistake again this time around. \[name\] also mentioned how she does not want to let down her parents/family, friends, and teachers about how she is not able to handle the tasks, expectations, grades, speed, and family life expectations that are being asked of her. Some good news, she did mention to me that swimming was the best part of her day, which is great to hear.

We talked about how to better handle the pressure she was feeling and how I also encouraged her to speak to her parents or a relative that could gently help her situation with an open/caring mind. I also mentioned to her that I would speak with our Safe Sport Coordinator, Coach Kelsey, for further advice to better help \[name\] as our priority is to help the swimmer the best we can. I also mentioned that it was likely that we would email her family as it is considered to be in the best interest of the swimmer and I have also been advised to do so by our Safe Sport Coordinator. 

We are sharing this information in hopes that it will spark a conversation at home that will help support and guide \[name\] as she is going through these hard times for her. She is already making the right decisions by speaking up and choosing to step away from self-harm. I’d ask that we keep supporting these decisions and provide the support/help she may need. An option we have here with the \[swim team\] is that we have a sport psychologist, which we can arrange to have sessions with \[name\] to help provide some support for her. Please let us know what you guys decide to do. We hope that \[name's\] situation improves and she continues to enjoy her time with us here in the TAC Titans. 

Thank you for your time. 

Respectfully,

\[coaches name\]

1qk8hje,"I have a crush ona girl I don't want to have a crush on anymore, help!",Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"(15M), I have had a crush on a shy girl in my class for a pretty damn long time, about 1.5 years now, how do I stop? Don't get me wrong, I would really like it if she liked me back but my case currently looks hopeless.

Alright time for details. This girl mostly just hangs around her friends and doesn't really talk to people outside her friend group, especially not boys. For the past few months I've tried to act on my feelings as I finally felt ready for a relationship and my feelings for her went from ""just a cool girl"" to a girl I really want to be with. At first it seemed like I had a chance, I really don't think she is out of my league looks wise, except that we are about the same height if that really matters (fyi she is a pretty damn tall girl at like 175 cms or such). 

The issues started when I wanted to try and find opportunities to speak to her more often, we share a hobby in ice skating and I see her in my ice skating rink quite often, but we really dont talk there like at all, she seems wayy too focused on practicing her figure skating so I just mind my business and she minds her. Max we say is maybe just. A sentance or 2 to each other. Other times we speak is at school and heres the thing, she is like really shy when talking to me, her voice is shaky and she seems nervous which I assume is a good sign but it might not mean a lot at all. And we text rarely on snapchat as well and in thise texts shes often really dry and doesnt really try to keep the conversation flowing.

Another weird sign is that I know one of her close friends ships her and me together, now this could just be to mock her or mock me. My crush always gets nervous and shy when she starts talking about me with her when I am around, but as I said this could just be making fun of me for all I know. 

Now I dont know what you think but based ont he facts I have laid down it seems pretty damn obvious that she really doesnt seem interested, another example is that she never even checks my snapchat stories which are often ice skating related, this doesnt really matter a lot due to her not being on snapchat a lot but I know damn well if I had a crush on someone I would at least be checking their snapchat stiries.

So heres the thing, I decided that she doesnt like me and that its best to move on about a month ago, but I really just can't, its extremely frustrating! Shes in my dreams, I think about her when listeing to music, I still am shy and nervous around her and I always just melt when I see her because shes so pretty. I know its best for me to move on, but how? It really does seem impossible.

What do you think of the whole situation? Do yall have any tips on moving on from a crush youve had for a while? Do you think theres a chance she still likes me (please dont feed my delusion). Any advice is appreaciated I just feel like I am pushed against the wall here.

1qkaiej,My grandma wants me to share a bedroom with my brother,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Okay, so recently my six-year-old little brother has taken a liking to sleeping next to me specifically, which I have no problem with if it is occasionally and not every day or two days in a row, because I hate people sharing a bed with me. I'm turning 16 this year, and I have never shared a bedroom with anyone ever since moving homes, let alone a bed. Maybe while having sleepovers or other occasions, but I never slept well. My parents used to insist that I slept in their room just for funsies and to have the whole family together and all, but what can you do if I don't like it, huh? I just don't, suck it up. Last night when I came back to my room after taking a dump I found my lil bro on my bed, my mom tucking him in. I did not want him there and I had made it clear an hour before. My mom scolded me so I slept on the couch until like 2 am when I woke up to my little brother crying because he did not like to sleep alone. Okay, I felt bad so I hugged him and he went to sleep back to my parents' room while I took over my own bed. Today I told my grandma this whole ordeal jokingly, which I heavily regret as I didn't take in mind my granny likes disagreeing with me, especially when it comes to spoiling my little brother. Since my brother sleeps in my parents' bed, my grandma insisted I should please him cause he is my brother and whatnot blah blah blah, and that I should share a freaking bedroom with him to leave my parents alone. Are you effing kidding me?
 #1 My parents don't even sleep on the same bed, my dad prefers to sleep on the living room couch most of the time.

 #2 In regards to my parents' intimacy, they just bring my brother to me with a lazy excuse and lock their bedroom door. They think I don't know, but I don't really mind because it's their business and I get it.

 #3 My brother has a bed that he uses for toy storage in my parents' bedroom, but my parents were the ones to bring up the idea of him sleeping next to them, so it's their problem if they don't want to use the kid's bed. 

#4 Unlike my parents, I DO have a problem with sharing a bed. Also, I am a 16-year-old girl. I want to hold onto the little privacy I have left which is having my own room, Jesus. I am not even allowed to lock my door while changing, and everyone in my household shares a single bathroom. I used to have the texts on my phone read every night until I turned 14. Sometimes I feel like my dad still reads them in secret, so I still delete them. 

So? What do you think granny? Still feel like disagreeing with me and having your old lady friend back you up? Too bad I can't really tell her all these things. And she will surely run her mouth to my mom about this topic when she comes back from work. So please, anyone, give me some good arguments to keep my last hope for privacy

1ql585s,"[16M] My girlfriend [16F] was forced by her parents to study in the UK, and we need some advices to be free, what we should do?",Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Hello Reddit. This is my first post here.

I decided to share my story and I really hope it will be interesting to read. I would also appreciate any advice you might have.

My girlfriend and I are both 16 years old, and we are from Ukraine. We have been dating for 8 months, but before that we were close friends for about 7 months. So overall, we have known each other for a long time and truly care about and love each other.

For the past 6 months, we have been in a long-distance relationship. Before that, we were also long-distance friends and partners, but the distance was only about 100 km. Now, however, the distance between us is around 2,000 km.

Her parents decided to send her to the United Kingdom for two years, until she turns 18, and then possibly to university as well. She studies at a boarding school that costs around £24,000 per year. The main problem is that no one asked for her opinion about this move. Even when she strongly objected, her parents completely ignored her wishes.

She wanted to stay in Ukraine and study in my city, but her parents refused. They justified their decision by saying that Ukraine has no future, that the education is worse, and that it is dangerous. However, in our region, the last missile strike happened about three years ago, so it feels more like an excuse than a real reason not to let her stay.

Being apart is extremely difficult for us emotionally, but we still try to maintain as much communication as possible and support each other every day.

Another serious issue is her health. She has gastrointestinal problems, and because of that, she cannot eat the food provided by the school — it makes her feel sick. Unfortunately, the school administration does not care at all. As a result, she often stays hungry. Physical education is also very intense: classes last up to two hours, and she becomes so exhausted that she sometimes feels close to fainting.

She also hasn’t managed to make friends there. Her interests are very different from the other students, and many of them seem quite materialistic, which makes it hard for her to connect with anyone.

Because of all this, we came up with a plan. At the beginning of September, she will try to seriously talk to her parents and ask them not to keep her there for another year. If that fails, she is considering doing something that would get her expelled, so that her parents would have no reason to enroll her in another boarding school and would instead bring her back to Ukraine.

Why September? Because at that time, there are usually more available spots in Ukrainian colleges, and her parents would most likely enroll her there.

I’d also like to add more context about the school itself. Since starting there, she has noticed that she feels like she is mentally degrading. She has only about three lessons per day, and they are very basic — things like drawing, elementary-level math, and music. Nothing more. This makes the education feel extremely weak and boring.

Some people might say that she is ungrateful to her parents for “giving her a better future.” But I want to emphasize again: no one ever asked what she wanted. She was basically forced to move to a country where she never wanted to study. She cries almost every day, often stays hungry because of the food situation, and feels completely unheard by her parents.

We manage to see each other only about 2–3 times every three months. Even then, her parents don’t allow us much freedom — we can’t travel anywhere together, and they clearly don’t like the fact that she has a boyfriend at all.

Thank you to everyone who read this. I would really appreciate any advice or perspective on this situation."

I want to tell him he should break up with her, but I’m afraid he’ll get defensive and my family will say to stay out of** **it.**

My brother \[15\] and his gf \[14\] have been dating for almost 6 months. When he first told me about her i was happy for him, she's his first gf, and because hes ASD we all thought he'd never experience a teen-relationship. Without knowing her mother and i did however talk to him about red flags in teen girls (like emotional manipulation/guilt-tripping, accusations, isolating, etc), not saying she is bad, we just didn't want him getting into situations he's not equipped to handle.

Things got off to a bit of a rocky start between her and my family since she tried pulling him away from us, but after some interventions, things got better as she begun spending more time with us. Until recently that is, lately i noticed she hasn't been speaking nicely to him and expects him to fix all her problems. Like i said, he's 15 and isn't ready to deal with girl issues.

What made me hate her was how she treated my brothers little dog. He (the dog) wanted to cuddle with them, so my brother suggested he cuddle his gf and his gf cuddle the dog so everyones happy. She says no and pushes him off, i was in the room next door and the dog came to me all upset. Im ngl, she somewhat resents the dog because he gets more cuddles from my brother then she does. Then he went back to them carrying a toy, and the same thing happened where he got pushed off the couch. My brother asked her what her deal is and pointed out how she can't treat his dog like that because he's his child. They got into a bit of an argument and she asked who he'd pick between her and the dog, and he picked his dog. She got mad. My brother, a direct young lad, asked her why shes grumpy and told her she can't sulk every time something doesnt go her way. As much as im proud of my brother, how she treated his innocent doggy made me angry enough to leave the vicinity, a beloved pets dignity shouldn't need to be debated. And when i walked past them i saw her laying on top of him so his dog couldn't snuggle with them. His dog would continuously bring them toys and every time he was rejected, which broke my heart

After she left i told my brother how proud i am of him and that he did the right thing. But i feel like telling him he should break up with her because its one thing for them to have issues amongst each other, however, its another thing for her grumpiness to extend to family members. It reminds me of those toxic relationships where the partner makes the person pick them or the pet. And yes they're both young and relationships dont tend to last, but he shouldn't be dealing with this, and since he's so naive and innocent he doesn't see the bigger picture. If shes not afraid to disrespect my brothers dog, what else is she not afraid to do?

If i do tell him how i really feel he'll get defensive (he already was when we brought up the dog incident) and my family will tell me to keep out of it to keep the peace and let him find out for himself.

WIBTAH if i told my brother him and his gf should break up?"
1qk756y,(UPDATE) How do I cut this guy off?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So after sitting with my thoughts for a few days, and talking to our mutual friend. Who was little to no help, she kinda just made me feel worse about the whole situation and said I just sounded mean/rude because he struggles financially (but he has all the requirements toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, running water, etc) so it’s not really a good excuse.

I messaged him a bit ago expressing my concerns and he was taking it well, saying he knew rhis was kinda coming. I told him all the stuff I mentioned in the previous post, (same title just without the brackets, if you haven’t read it) but then he was like I understand if this is something that ends it for you. So I basically was like I’m glad your taking care of yourself more, but I can’t deal with this weight so I think I’m gonna have to end this. 

He didn’t take it well and just kinda started resulting to saying he was almost fully good with his hygiene and said stuff like his pet got taken away as a way to emotionally manipulate me to backtrack. He’s still messaging as I type this. The worse part is I feel bad about it, so I can’t will myself to block him but I can’t be assed to keep dealing with this. Help me out here, I know it’s hard to work with."

So either she realized it and didn’t care or is completely oblivious to it haha "
1qjdsga,We lost them both last night. (TW: Pet death),Pets,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"Cancer is unfortunately very common in dogs, especially purebreds like my English mastiff and my pug.

Stella, my pug, was 16 when we had to put her down last night, she had survived uterine cancer at the age of 9, fortunately it was only in her uterus and we had to get her spayed anyways because she was retiring from breeding and too old to have a safe pregnancy, we stopped breeding her at 5 though, she was also hit by a car that day so we were going to take her to the vet to check for injuries, she wasn't hit hard by the car and only had some minor bursing, but during that appointment she found cancer, which we treated and she went on to live many more years before she got cancer again, this time all over her body and we hadn't noticed because she wasn't showing signs, and then she got a cyst on her neck, we treated it but then she started coughing every now and then.

Sampson on the other hand, was only 10, which is still pretty old for a big dog, our other English Mastiff, Delilah was put down at 7 as she had gotten bone cancer.

Sampson got prostate cancer, the symptoms came suddenly, one day he was normal, playing with the cats in the garden and then he started getting lumps on his legs, eventually he stopped eating and lost a lot of weight, he wouldn't even drink and would refuse to pee until his bladder failed, the cancer caused him to get a UTI and filled his kidneys with stones.

I knew Sampson had to go but I had no idea Stella had cancer, she seemed fine aside from the occasional coughing, she was still eating and drinking normally, her dementia caused her to have accidents on the floor but I heard that was pretty normal for a dog with dementia, during her final days she actually seemed better because winter was ending and the higher temperatures made it easier on her old body, since it tends to help with her arthritis, we have no way of knowing her condition was as bad as it was.

I had been worried she'd die when I was in college and I'd miss her death, I don't know, I guess it feels like I prepared myself emotionally, having picked out an urn and taken pictures of her, I never really thought of Sampson as old, I guess I stopped counting the years we had him since he never seemed to age, his face was still a soft black with slight grey around his mouth, and he was still a vibrant chestnut color, still playful, he acted a lot younger than he was.

I had Stella since I was like late 1 maybe early 2 years old, she's been in my life so many years, and she was still so active and happy, her tail was always wagging, it feels so weird to walk through the house and not see her or hear her, I still find myself reaching for her bowl to put water in some dog food for her. Everytime I go outside it's like I expect Sammy to be following me around, trying to play, I still expect him to be sleeping on the trampoline or playing, but he's gone, they both are and I just... get to keep going."
1qiv1t0,my brother's (soon to be) ex wife is insufferable,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"at first it was harrassment on tik tok with 7 different accounts, then it stopped
then right before new years (i didn't realize it eas her again, thought it was a rando troll) and on the 1st of the month she came for my brother, his gf, me, my dad, and my sister with AI pictures of us to make insults. me and the gf threatened legal action and she took it all down the same day.
I look at profile views on tik tok for completely unrelated reasons and I just like seeing who looks at my page. saw what couldve been a cool profile so I clicked it.
... it was her again. but I guess her and my ex decided they're getting married after being together for just about 4 months (whenever she lets my brother know her address so he can serve divorce papers...)
and apparently she's now a furry along with him which was just unsettling to think of for personal reasons.
genuinely I just want her to stop thinking of me, stop searching up my account, stop looking at my shit.. I dont go on her accounts ever. I dont search for them. im living my life. but even though she didnt comment or do anything to harass, she just had to make a point to view my profile.. and im certain she knows I look at those views. 
she's a 26 year old (about to be 27) who teaches middle school. if she didn't keep backing down before legal action was taken she wouldve faced the consequences by now.
its funny because when I dated him for almost 2 years the idea of marriage was like not even on the table at that point- and I guess she's keeping up with the same theme because her and my brother got common-law married i think within a month of coming out of a break

im also not 100% over the guy, but im very aware it would never work out so this just made my stomach churn.. im not like sad I'm just shocked as fuck 💀 honestly I hope he doesnt get himself into a real sticky situation with this.. 😬

1qj77ol,I feel stuck in a unhealthy online relationship,Relationship,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"honestly jokes on me for having a online relationship for past 2 years + the girl is 2yo younger who i met on roblox in 2020 and we both r minors so u get it. we r safe for next 2 years from any illegal age gap stuff 

officially started 1.5years ago and man now i hate it

we don't do any type of couple shi the only this is we text each other everyday and i get ""gn kisses"" on vid and nothing more than that and im not comfortable doing anything or asking for anything as she is younger 

now its just a person who keeps me compney frankly she just existing now cuz i don't have many friends and n she also talks me  like once or twice a day, and i feel really upset when i over text and she ignores or dosent reply for hours

im not breaking up with her cuz i don't wanna feel lonely and i still have hopes for future 

honestly now its just depressing some days that being my age i feel bad because a girl 2yo younger than me didn't give me attention if we change the prospective.

while writing this post im not happy by the way this all sounds like a ""2yo younger online gf"" helllll 

she has ge left and i don't im soon gonna be adult and have less chances of finding a date and she is gonna be in her prime teenage years and might find a bf irl to replace me and my dumb ahhh rejected girls for her

as a dumb dude i would really appreciate any advice atp"
1qiuya3,Being left on read/delivered,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Are people actually like genuinely bothered by being left on read? I guess I understand if it's someone you're trying to be friends with but they aren't putting in effort and are just ignoring you, but is it the same when it's a close friend??? 

My friend (who is honestly the only person I really text) she leaves me on read or delivered a bunch, but I'm not like bothered, I'll just keep messaging her like she responded. I also tend to rant (see images) a lot about things so I'll send multiple walls of text, sometimes multiple times a day, so I understand that she's not going to respond to all my messages. (Though I am really happy when she does, but she has her own life.)

I also know her phone is always on silent so it's going to take a while for her to not only respond, but to also even see the text.

There's even been times where I'll message a bunch of things for a few days and she leaves me on read for all of them, and I'm just like whatever. Again a lot of my texts are rants (again see images) or like little anecdotes so there's not really a set way to reply, I'm just happy she's reading them :)

Also, a little thing that gets me really happy for no reason, is when I open my messages app and right when I do it shows she read my message at the same time that I opened the app, and I'm like thinking in my head ""omg we're so in synch🥰🥰""

Anyways... I understand being left on read can be kind of upsetting but I just wanted to talk about how I see it, and how I don't really mind when it happens. :D"
1qjekat,Y'all is it toxic ?,Relationship,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"\[Trigger warning : Mention of trauma, Alcohol, Self harm\]

So for context me and my gf (wlw), are 15, we met in September at the beginning of the year, back then I was going through a tough break up with my emotionally abusive ex, but I was recovering really well, I was more stable than ever, I started working on my emotional maturity, I was healing my anxious attachment type, I was even leaning towards secure  !

...Then I met her, we became friends and I immediately had a crush on her, it wasn't reciprocated at first but she was very ambiguous, leading me on, giving mixed signals, we eventually became a situationship, we grew closer and closer but each time we'd get closer, something became more and more painful, and, even by the first month of meeting her, my mental health started to fall apart, also note that during the first months, a LOT of my traumas resurfaced, one by one, all the traumas my brain either locked away for years or was convinced wasn't ""that bad""

two months in, I was 0% near secure attachment towards her, I became more and more depressed, which is why by the end of the second month I decided to ""break up""(tho it wasn't something real to begin with), but seeing the pain in her eyes, and feeling the distance I created I realized that I couldn't live with her, but I couldn't live without her either so we decided to work on better communication

later, I felt less and less valued and wanted, and the incompatibility that I've always seen in us (the only thing I was never delusional about) made itself more and more clear so I tried breaking up again, to keep me she promised to make more efforts to see me outside of school, (five months in she never followed through)

back then I had a VERY strong self love, and a strong self worth and I could feel she didn't see my value, I became obsessed with making her see it cause I thought if she did then she'd treat me differently, but the more I lost sight of myself trying to get her to see me, and slowly my sense of identity fell apart

we """"broke up"""" again on Christmas, this time, it was initiated by her, after I tried to make us an official relationship since, at that point we were basically dating, but she refused because we aren't compatible, she came back the next day because she missed me and we decided we wanted to make it work as an official relationship and even though we were back together, ever since that I could feel that my trust was gone

it's been nearly a month since that breakup, we have conflicts nearly everyday, it doesn't get fixed anymore, unlike it used to, we used to repair consistently, although the ""repair"" most of the time just lasted a couple days, up to two weeks if I was lucky, but now, there's none of that, the communication is very poor, with every conflict a piece of me dies, I very recently got addicted to Alcohol (when the me I was a couple months ago swore I would never get into drinking), I got high on DXM, when past me was terrified of any kind of drug, I crawled back into self harm when I was nearly one year clean, my fear of abandonment has totally taken over me

Things I didn't mention, I often have a cycle of overthinking, which is now my constant state, a cycle of seeing her as the best partner ever, as such a caring and loving person after she shows me bare minimum but then thinking she hates me and that's she's a terrible partner that I should hate her and leave each time she triggers my fear of abandonment (which is now almost always)"

https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/s/ncbAFibyab

I’m going this on Reddit so that means you know my mental state is totally fucked right now.

Anyways she and I talked a lot today and I got really scared that she was gonna end it for good but by the grace of God she didn’t. She has her stuff to figure out so I asked her to focus on herself but also to not give up on me because I don’t want to lose her and she said she didn’t plan on it anytime soon so I am really happy about that. The only thing is that it is gonna be a long ass wait for her which I’m willing to do because she’s fucking perfect, but I need things to keep me busy so that I don’t go down the rabbit hole and go insane trying to come up with scenarios in my head about her. If you guys can help at all with this or just have had this experience before then please let me know because I need it right now.

I’ll keep updating you guys as things progress. Thank you all again. ❤️‍🩹"

1qik7ac,Relationship advice..,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Debating on whether or not I should talk to my girlfriend about this or stay quiet

So heres whats going on, so we are both high school students, and she has an ex that she says shes still friends with, has expressed they are only friends, and they call and text time to time, and sometimes ill open discord and see her in a call with her ex and another one of her guy friends and I can't help but be concerned/upset, I havent told her I felt this way at all

For some more context, my last relationship, I got cheated on exactly the same way, girl convinced me she was over her ex for a year straight, trusted her, they started becoming closer friends and I let it happen, then she cheated on me with him.

Just seeing her on call with her ex and other guys just rubs me the wrong way, I haven't said anything yet because im scared ill accidently ruin their friendship if they are just friends. I dont know how i can go about telling her this without causing issues, so, should i keep my mouth shut? Or do I say something, and if so, what do I say?"
1qijmjo,bad girlfriend,Relationship,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"I actually think i’m the worst girlfriend i get so angry over the little things but in my head they aren’t little things, like he’s really close friends with my best friend but i know neither of them are like that but idk she’s prettier and skinnier than me so i get a lil insecure when he’s constantly on the phone to her or offering to go over and make her breakfast (which he’s never done for me not even offered) and this other girl he’s friends with used to have a crush on him and im also friends with her it’s like a big mixed gender friend group but i get really overprotective when it comes to her because he defends her like “she isn’t like that with me anymore” (they used to cuddle all the time and she lay all over him) but idk if I’ve went too far in stopping him from being alone with her at all i just have trust issues and him being really good friends with other girls kind of freaks me out a lil because i know what guys are like hell we used to be best friends before we dated but i don’t want to overdo or overthink things because i love him so dearly and i really don’t wanna lose this one, he also keeps saying to me when i bring up something he’s done that im making him feel shitty but idk maybe your just being shitty. he is honestly a great bf tho he does so much for me but just lil things get to me sometimes and i understand that we’re leaving the “honeymoon phase” can just feel kind of lonely sometimes but we push through because we promised each-other that we would work through all our issues during this stage of our relationship because we really want a future with each other and another thing that’s making me overthink, we are both very spiritual in a tarot cards angels crystals type way and he got a tarot reading today and it say he’s going to a have a loss either in a friendship or a relationship so avoid impulsive decision making but tbh if we lost eachother right now it wouldn’t just be losing a relationship it would be losing my best friend too because i go to him about everything ya know anyway imma stop talking now because this is long as hell but comment advice or comments on the situation gimme an idea if wtf to do rn thanks

update: i’ve spoke to a few friends then ended up just apologizing one for being mean to him recently (im on my period but it needs to be done) and then also for not trusting him he reassured me everything was ok and he understood my concerns and promised to prioritize me over his girl bsfs more because that was my main concern anyway thanks a lot for the advice 🥰"
1qipez5,Think I am going Insane....,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So I 17M (Going on 18 Mext month and was too lazy To make it 18th So Made it 18 right now) Have been a single Guy, And Up until 10th Std I din't care about relationships...

In the Junior College (11th 12th) I started a different School... And I kinda Crushed On this Girl, Its been more than 1½ since I started liking her, (Oct 2024) She left our school to go to her old school, I Went to her house, Played on PC And stuff.. Slowly Started Falling for her.

Now For the past 1 Year I have been trying to ask this girl, Call her M, And For some reason or the other We cannot go Out, Like She seems Intrested, Like She Invited me to go to places and got Sick. Other time We planned to meet Ouside a stadium where her school Was going for Sports Day, (Got stuck due to Security, And like I have been feeling shit about it for very long, We habe been Texting and keeping contacts for almost 2 years And Still nothing... Like She will Show intrest sometimes like ( I am in the middl of an Online Class, You keep texting, I'll Respond in between) I am Busy But I'll give you time, On the other hand Complete Ignoring of texts, And I think this is because We are both preparing for Entrance Tests, And I get a Feeling that she Likes me.... Tho just once I want to Confess And Finish it off. Rejection / Dating, Whatever Its taking too much On my mind space. And just wheb I thought maybe I dont think about her I had a dream... (not NSFW... But people Might think it maybe a little erotic so Marked it So)

Today Morning My alarm went off at 5:10 (Forgot to switch it off) and went back to sleep, I had a dream then. It didn't feel like a dream it felt REAL..... Like Steins;Gate.... There She, Her Mother And Her father (I have met her mother, And she showed me a photo of her father Over Text) And Her, In a Casual-Formal dress come to our House, I didn't know they were coming it seems.... And I realised this only after I Looked her straight In the eye... I realised Its M.... Later Me, M Her parents And My Parents Sat in the Main Hall of the house where people come to sit and talk, And We were nicely Chatting... Later I went Into me bedroom with M, We sat there kinda akward When We started talking about how we were friens, And out of the blue she said, ""could we start start Holding hands like we used to??"" I think Hold Hands? LIKE HELL WE NEVER DID- (I remeber We had held hands For some reason, In reality We have never held hands like Romantically, Once maybe she dragged me into her bedroom to place PC games while our mothers Hit it off in the hall) and I sit there Holding hands And We start Leaning And suddely I have to confess to her, And she is sooo Happy She hugs me And Asks Me ""Can I French Kiss?"" I am soo Happy I just go for it. After that She dissapears, turns out she had to go back because Of studies......

Ever since that Ended I cannot forget it. Each interaction, Each Touch, Held Hands even her lips Felt real... I have never Kissed someone But it felt Real... I dont know whats happeneing, I am getting this sad Longing, Maybe an obsession for her that is screaming at me for some reason, I dont know what to do, I feel like I just Want to Confess And Hug her tightly And All my problems Will be solved...  What is this How do I get out of It... Whats Happening to Me, Why Is there a Feeling like something is not right..."
1qij1et,19 and I've liked the same girl for 7 years,Relationship,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"This is my sad story that I've kept bottled for so long :(

(Sry about the pic I didn't want to include my full face and that's the only one I could find)

So first year of middle school there was this girl that I was instantly attracted to, both visually and personality wise. She had like identical freckles to me and we both laughed like crazy. Basically if we made eye contact in class we would start laughing uncontrollably and my laughter would make her keep laughing and her laughter would make me keep laughing. The teachers hated it 🤣. We once wondered about how if one day years from now we came across each other in the wild if we would just start laughing 🤓.

Anyways we got along great and I would walk with her after school a lot to where she'd get picked up. I got along good with her mom too and I remember talking with her a bit after class sometimes. 

Fast forward towards seventh grade or something. At this point everyone knows I like her. I went with my homies to a dance once and all her friends came up to me and were all mockingly like ""aren't you going to dance with *insert-name*"" blah blah blah. 

And then one day in class she came up to me and asked me if I liked her romantically. I just brushed it off and said no...

Fast forward towards the end of middle school. I still don't have a phone since my mom is crazy strict. I'm in science class and she sits at the same table as I do. She's going to be going to a different high school so I ask if I can have her numbers so we can keep in contact. She gives it to me on a post it. AND I LOSE THE F\*\*KING POST IT. 

Fast forward to when I'm 16. I'm at the beach biking with my friends. We go explore some pier and when I turn around, she's right in front of me with her friends. We both kind of freeze and after a moment say eachother's names. My friends call me over and her friends call her over. We walk away and she waves and says my name one last time as she goes off. 

I've tried to get over her. But I just can't. I try to be attracted to other people but every couple months I'll have this vivid dream with her in it. And that dream always comes just as I've begun to forget. 

So yeah... that's my story. I'd like to think there is some parallel world where we got together and had the life of our dreams. Now that I'm older I wish I had just asked. I will take the closure of rejection over wondering what could have happened for the rest of my life. "
1qi18mq,I have a date tomorrow,Social,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So since my last post on r/teenagers, a lot has happened. My stepdad left me, my gf made me apologize for being sad about my stepdad leaving(had to leave there) and bla bla bla. Anyways. I do have a date tmrw after school with this girl, that I am gonna ask to be my gf. We already had a cute movie date night, snuggled the whole time and stuff. Really really nice night. Different story tho. I already know, that we both have a crush on one another, since one of our mutuals can’t keep their mouth shut(appreciate it, but like what are we? In grade 5?). I don’t even was nervous about like anything. But omfg my heart is racing and racing. I can HEAR MY FUCKING PULSE just by thinking about tomorrow. I am really nervous. The date is also like right after school, so first we‘ll get some food at a really nice chinese place, where you can see them making the noodles and stuff. I also don’t know what to do after. So what if, after we go eat, I can’t think of anything, the Moment isn’t right, or she even says „NO!“ or „With you?“ or „let’s rather be friends“ or something like that. 

TL;DR: I have a date tmrw, am really nervous thx bye"
1qi4lm0,I need some swarm intelligence relationship advice,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Im quite an overthinker but even the current situation simply confuses me.

So there was this girl I have had a crush on for about 6 Months now and about 1,5 months ago I finally decided to approach her. I added her on snap since the day I wanted to ask for her snap she was nowhere to be found. After adding her, it was a Friday, she said she didn’t know who I was and bit by bit I told her who I was. I sent her a picture of me and we texted a bit that evening. It worked out really well and even though she was not that engaging she asked if we could phone the next day. We phoned for 2h and I had the feeling that we liked eachother since she really talked much and sounded happy. One day later we texted and after coming home from the school the next day I got a text saying something like: „I don’t think I have time for you, we can stay friends“. I was completely devasted since stuff worked out so great the day before. But i still didn’t want to give up since I had the feeling of finding the one. There was more or less silence for exactly a month until I sent a text; I wanted to try again, I think we would have liked eachother in the future and that I thought I caught the wrong time when asking the first time. I told her that I really like her. She thought about it for a day, and then told me that she can’t imagine us more then friends but she randomly added that we could meet up as friends soon and she is ok with us talking again. She even asked when we could meet up before me. We met and went to eat breakfast and talked for 2,5h. It was great, I don’t think I didn’t anything wrong. I opened the door for her, was polite and tried to be a gentleman, as far as a friend would do. I even paid for her meal, even though it wasn’t officially a date. After I got home I sent her a text saying how great I was feeling and how much fun I had during our meeting. She texted back saying about the same, but mentioning again that she wanted to be honest with me and still thinks of me as a friend. Usally I answer good stuff, but this time I was a little sad again that she had to explicitly mentioned this again. So I thanked her for her honesty and apologized that I didn’t know what to write direct after, and again in a little longer text about 2h later. She has been sending a few less text for about 3 days and less snaps. When trying to initiate conversations she is also kinda dry. I don’t know what this is anymore. Is the „your my friend“ a backdoor incase things don’t work out? Am I her 2. Option? Does she not like me again? I don’t get what I should do, like just give up or continue? Please give me you guys opinions. It’s such a rollercoaster of emotions. Btw, I was never pressuring and always gave her as much time as she needed, so all her decisions are well thought through. EDIT: I told her that I would unadd her and leave her alone if she said no again after the second time. But she still chose to keep contact."

1qhs19w,Need Advice 🙏,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"TW: Self harm and Suicide

My sister mental health has been declining as of last year, and late fall last year she started cutting herself. I told my mom about it and they said they would work on it together, but not do therapy cause neither of them trust it. My sisters health now sucks and I think she's still self harming. I want to help her but there are several problems:

\*\*We keep fighting\*\*
I feel like she barely respects me or my time and basically views me a servant half the time. This causes us to argue and not talk for a while which irritates my mom and makes her cut herself

\*\*This may be toxic of me to think but...\*\*
I feel like half the time she does it to guilt trip me because half the time she does it plain view right after we fight and doesn't bother trying to hide it. I'll naturally be upset because she's my sister and I care and she'll be like ""oh don't worry, just continue to watch your TV while I noticeably self harm in the background, no biggie"" (she hasn't said this but it's the vibe she's conveyed ""

\*\*I'm Exhausted\*\*
My extracurriculars have me up early in the morning or out late in the evening making me physically tired. This situation male me mentally and emotionally exhausted. I also haven't been having the greatest self esteem last and have also been feeling crappy and having dark thoughts.
4.\*\* I'm annoyed\*\*
Half the time I find this whole situation annoying because both her and my mom refuse to get her therapy. I'm stuck playing messenger as her self harm, and also being her emotional pillow/punching bag. I'm a child, I shouldn't have to act like a parent and deal with this.

I feel like crap and don't know what to do. I can't tell anyone what I'm feeling cause then they'll all feel worse, I can't reiterate my sisters problems to anyone since she refuses therapy, and the I'm exhausted in all ways possible and barely making it through each day. If anyone could offer advice I'd appreciate it. Also sorry if formattings crap, I'm on mobile"

1qhlp6q,"Am I crazy, or did this guy I cut off get a new girlfriend who looks and acts exactly like me?",Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"For personal reasons I’m going to keep some details vague, with no pics for privacy reasons BUT I will describe as best I can, but here’s the situation.

A while ago this guy and I started talking online. He developed feelings for me and at the time, I wasn’t sure how I felt (leaning more toward “like”) and I also didn’t want to do an online only relationship since this would’ve been my first relationship.  I felt it could end up hurting him and me as online is rlly awkward. On top of that, my parents are very strict and wouldn’t approve of me meeting someone I met online. I explained this to him and told him he deserved better.

We stayed friends for a bit, but over time his behaviour started to make me uncomfortable. He’d say things like if he ever saw my sister in public, he’d go up to her, or if he saw me in public with family, he’d approach me. I told him clearly that I didn’t like that and that it creeped me out. He would just randomly send me ""why cant I just love yoouuu"" ""why cant I love via"". If I was busy or sick for a day, he’d spam me with passive-aggressive messages like “Ok.” or get angry at me for not replying. He didnt feel like the same person I was friends with.. which was sad as I really liked spending time with him

Eventually, I felt like my boundaries were being pushed constantly, so I ended the friendship. He acted like it was fine and said “yeah, that’s cool.”

It wasn’t fine.

For months afterwards, he stalked my account, and even had his friends stalking me too. I ended up privating my accounts, blocking them, and moving on. After a long time passed with no issues, I unprivated my account and went back to normal until I noticed one of his friends looking at my profile again.

I blocked his friends account but maybe a curiousity went over me and I decided to check his account, and my stomach dropped. He’s now dating a girl who looks a lot like me, dresses in the same style as me, and even has the same brownish hair colour, Hime hairstyle, similar facial features... same clothing style. We live in a small town-ish area, and when we were friends he had told me he’d never met anyone with a style like mine (J-fashion / jirai kei) So it baffled me that he suddenly now has a girlfriend with a lot in common with me.. 

At first I thought maybe I was just being paranoid because of the past stalking. But I showed my friends the pictures, and they all independently said she not only has my exact style but also looks like me. I don't want it to sound like me trying to be egotistical something about it genuinely feels off.

I won’t be sharing pictures for privacy reasons, and I have nothing against his girlfriend. She seems sweet, and honestly I hope things work out between them so I'm not interacting with them I just checked it out bc of his friend stalking again. I hope their relationship stays stable (mostly because I don’t want him coming back to stalk me again)

BROO the worst part? There’s a strong chance I might be going to the same college as him, which means there’s a possibility he could confront me in person... 

So… am I crazy for thinking this is weird and concerning?? "
1qhhm0v,I've been such a bad friend cause of something that's Nobody's fault but mine.,Advice,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"I feel so jealous of all my friends and I keep acting like a horrible person cause of it

So basically my school does a ski trip, that i didnt get picked for but one of my best friends like childhood friends did, and im obviously extremely happy for her, but she got roomed with a girl whos known to not like me and shit talk me, which she couldnt control getting roomed with her, but my friend keeps posting about being on the ski trip and all which is great for her and i am happy, but ive been in such a shitty mood since theyve left. She's also the person I would call a lot and rant to, which again I can't do (sidenote she also calls and rants and chats with me but the ski trip is done by school so phones are restricted). But the issue is I've been in a horrible mood, I generally have been really snappy and short with alot of my friends, and im so jealous, ive been horrible to my friends and family, and cried and she keeps posting, and of course this isnt her fault at all i know that i just feel like shit and hate that I wasn't chosen.

1qhfpsf,Read If You Wish (It's A Long One),Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Hey everyone... This is different from my normal ""pretty photo"" posts mainly because I just to say something and I wanted to write it out... If you wanna stay you can but if not you don't have to :)

I've seen this whole I.C.E. government stuff left and right, and furthermore I know how serious someone well... doing something to themselves or hurting themselves is... So I want to just say a story and hopefully it might comfort you guys a bit... Again if you wanna stay stay, up to you :)

2,000 years ago... A man was born by a Virgin named Mary in a manger in a stable... And all his life he loved people, preached in synagogues, temples, everywhere physically possible... But he died. Why? 

He died because he saw how dark the world was, he saw all the cruel things thats been done and yet he knew what needed to be done... Blood needed to be given as the atonement for the wrongdoings... And that man's blood, was none other then Jesus Christ... He loves you, he literally died on a cross for our wrongdoings! A perfect man, killed for righteousness... But filled with love for each and every one of us... But why would he do such a thing if we were wrong? 

Because he doesnt want you to perish! He wants you to see yes you may be wrong, yes you may have done something in the past, but he wants to forgive you! He loves you so so so so SO much and he never has left you and never will... We sadly have just been the ones drawing away from him... But hes still right there... 
And if you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart God raised him from the dead you WILL be saved! You WILL be a new creation, and you WILL be with him in paradise... 

But he's not gonna lift up the proud... You would have to repent, and confess your sins to God. And no matter what works you could do, it wouldnt of mattered, not unless repentance comes... And im not saying this in a rude way, nor am I trying to...Works can come after repentance and works are good. But we are saved by grace through faith, not by our works. And our heart matters to because he looks at that, not what we say...

It's just like Mary's song and what she says in it... 
Luke 1:52 NIV
[52] He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.

This verse corresponds with repentance too I feel. Because yes if your confident what your doing is right even when its wrong, and keep saying your right all the time and don't need help, you'd be brought down like a ruler from their throne... But If you KNOW what your doing is wrong, and if you know you need help... God would lift you up, and bless you abundantly. But just please... 

Please know that he loves you, he wants a relationship with you and he wants your heart, people look outwardly but he wants your heart. So give that, and the rest will come in time. And he wants you to repent... And know that you are worth something! That's why Jesus died for you! You are beautiful, and you are loved :)

Luke 5:32 NIV
[32] I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”

2 Peter 3:9 NIV
[9] The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.

John 3:16 NIV
[16] For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have
eternal life. 

Ephesians 2:8-10 NIV
[8] For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— [9] not by works, so that no one can boast. [10] For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

You are enough, and worth something. And remember, I love you, but Jesus loves you more! :)"
1qh9of9,who else has extreme anger they don’t know what to do with?,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I have a single mom, my dad passed away when I was younger but I feel it’s so hard to keep up a good relationship. My mom is an amazing mom, she goes above and beyond for me constantly, and I still can’t seem to be nice. I mean we get along, but if she slurs her words once or just says something “wrong” it’s like a fucking switch in my brain flips. I could be laughing and my smile would immediately drop, and then i’m just irritated and angry at her. The most we argue about is the way she parents my little siblings and her drinking. The issues we argue about are NEVER resolved, because it’s in her power to change. I think that’s why i get so upset? I don’t know. I know my anger is unjustified. I’m too angry about small things… Like if I lost something and she doesn’t find it i get angry at her and blame her. I say horrible things. I don’t know how to change this or control my anger.. Trust me i’ve tried. While I used to punch walls and break things I don’t do that anymore, just incredibly hurtful words. i feel sick after our arguments, and I feel such a deep self loathing. In a way it makes me feel connected to my mother, cause i know she hates herself. I don’t know why I degrade her and make it worse. Sometimes I’m scared she will kill herself, she already slowly is with her habits. Everything I say to her is what I want to say to myself because I know me and my mom are basically the same person. but that doesn’t make it okay. I want to let go of this anger but it comes back everytime. I feel stuck, i feel trapped in a jar full of anger and now matter how hard i shake the jar upside down the anger stays in it. I don’t know. Does anyone deal with extreme unjustified anger with their mom? I don’t resent her, but she makes me so so angry   "
1qhekrr,"Should I confess? 16M, 16F",Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"
There's this cool girl I like. We met not long ago, at the end of May, because we have common interests. I was on a dating site, I didn't have any serious intentions because I always thought these sites were crap, but when I saw her profile, I decided to try liking her. On the same day, she liked me back and we started chatting.

It's worth noting that from around the age of 12-13, I led a very nerdy lifestyle, spending all my free time on the computer, hanging out with my internet friends on Discord, because I didn't have any in real life, and so on. So when I first found common ground with a nice person from my city, I was scared of the idea of meeting up. I didn't think I would be able to meet someone like her in person anytime soon, but I did. It turned out that she was similar to me in this regard. We were both very embarrassed and shy, and the whole walk was more like a failed stand-up routine where every attempt to cheer someone up ended in a facepalm on both sides or a desire to run away. Was it awkward? Yes. Did I like it? Of course, damn it, I hadn't hung out with people for several years, and here was not just some random guy, but a girl with similar interests.

In the future, the walks continued, albeit rarely, but we still see each other (the last time we hung out together was before New Year's). By November, I realized that she seemed to me to be someone more important than just a friend. I can't figure out if my feelings are real or if it's just standard puberty nonsense where you see everyone of the opposite sex as a potential partner, but I really can't let go of the idea of being with her. The thing is, as I said, we're similar, and that's playing a cruel joke on me, because I can see that despite all the pleasant and comfortable conversations we've had, she still finds it difficult to talk about her feelings without resorting to jokes and the like. I can see that she is very shy, and most likely my confession will cause her a lot of stress, even if it is mutual. I can see that she doesn't dislike me, but it's hard for her to be sincere. She says she considers it a sign of weakness and is afraid that people will turn away from her after that. I don't want to lose her in that case, but keeping quiet is just unbearable. On the other hand, I don't understand if it's worth it, because it's just a teenage relationship. I already had an online relationship two years ago, and it turned out to be traumatic. I still think about it sometimes. Imagine what would happen if I got dumped in real life? I can't even imagine it. Come on, I'm not even sure she likes guys...

Anyway, Valentine's Day is coming up, and I've already figured out how I can confess to her. All that's left is to decide whether I'm going to do it or not. I've probably described everything in a very vague way and lost the thread of the story, but please, if you care, give me some advice."
1qh2srw,Summer work flashbacks,Social,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I remember that one time at 7/11 I carried a tazer to keep myself safe. I told my coworker I have it incase someone tries to rob us, but then they said ""Can I try it?"" I was confused so I asked ""Try what"" and they wanted to taze themselves to see if they can take it. So in response I said ""Later after work"". Which I never did. When I went back the next day she asks ""Can you taze me for real"" and I told her I forgot about it, for some reason she believed me because she knew I was the forgetful janitor. I didnt wanna follow the sharing is caring etiquette, like tazing someone?
But I didnt want them to be tazed, because I know what it's like. I tazed myself too, to see what it felt like, because like her I was BORED and I didnt want her to be tazed on the job ykykyk

1qh0i2n,lowk being harassed at school (not sexually) what to do😭,Advice,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"ok im just gonna try and keep it short, im a senior in hs, basically about 3 weeks ago while i was waiting for the bus i couldn’t figure out how to turn off my “find my” alarm thing and these 2 girls ive literally NEVER met in my life (idk maybe sophomores-juniors?) made fun of me the wholeeeee ride for not knowing 😭 and they made sarcastic comments about my appearance and shit like “she’s texting her boyfriend about us” “omg no how would she have a bf nobody likes her” etc ????? (i don’t even like boys??)

i thought they were just being stupid and ignored them but now whenever they see me on campus they just start shouting “senior girl!!” “i LOOVE you senior girl!!!” at me and start kinda following me around for a bit while hysterically laughing, and ppl around turn to look at me 😭 like i get its stupid but i have (recovering) social anxiety and it makes me kinda scared to leave my block nowadays in fear of seeing them lmao so like

what do i do?? do i report this or do i suck it up cuz im sensitive 🫩

anyway edit cuz i forgot:

if you’re wondering why i dont just yell at them to fuck off / record it it’s bc

1. again im a very anxious + neurodivergent person, i enter flight mode immediately i genuinely can’t help it (getting help for it)
2. i dont want to unnecessarily escalate the situation
3. i mean whats the school gonna do im a SENIOR, these are 14 yos at best, and i graduate in a couple months anyway"
1qh0hkn,My mom is sad that we are doing great without her,Advice,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"So to keep it short: My mom is gone for work for a month and she was alone on workcation before, leaving my dad, my brothers and I (17nb) alone.

My mom is a very overwhelmed woman. We all are neurodivergent except for her, and my older brother is a big burden. My twin and I are managing and in therapy, so its gotten better. She is very frustrated with us and she cant handle her anger. She was always the present parent, but also the actively abusive parent.

My dad and us twins are very similar and we get along great most of the time. When my mom is around its always a lot of yelling and every little thing can set it off. My Dad isn't perfect and he does screw up often, but he is trying his best and he shows that cares very much. He is the one getting yelled at the most by my mom and I think it really gets to him. (also she always gets us kids involved and puts us in a tough position)

Now she was gone for most of January and we had a great time without her. The house isn't sparkly clean, like when she is around, but its clean, the cats are fed and happy and we all are doing our part and helping our dad. 

I told my mom that we have a great time and everything is going well and apparently she told my dad she is worried that she is doing something wrong, that we are happier without her. The thing is I dont want her to be sad. I feel guilty, because she puts so much effort in and I really appreciate that. But im way less stressed without her. I love seeing my dad being able to be a little more himself and sharing his interest and thoughts.

We're visiting her next week and then going back home all together. I dont want things to go back how they were. 

TLDR: My mom is sad that we are happier without her, while she is away for work. 

So can anyone help me? What am I supposed to do? I dont want to make my mom sad, but im also glad that she was away and im so much better without her yelling at me all the time."

1qgurv2,I need some advice.,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"We met in the summer of 2025. Two months prior, I had met her cousin through my friend since the 3rd grade. I went to summer camp, and we talked a lot. So I liked the girl (she did too and thought I was 15 because of my voice), and I didn't keep it a secret; in fact, I didn't even have to say anything. My best friend was her cousin, and while on vacation, we were on a call, and one thing led to another. We ended up setting up a two-way knowledge that we liked each other. My friend wants to be a police officer when he grows up, and is a damn good one at that. He was essentially my wingman. So for a 4-6 hour drive, we talked nonstop from the middle of Virginia to the border of Pennsylvania. After I made it home, we called and FaceTimed a lot. We decided we would formally meet (we met online through friends I already knew, so don't get scared for me). I came with a friend who was her cousin, and we played soccer for a bit, and then she arrived. She watched me and him play for a bit, then we went over to the park. Then we sat down with her younger brother, and she finally sent him off to look at birds (and I am dead ass that is exactly what he did). Before this, we did a truth or truth game (not a typo) or just did a question wheel. Remember this game. Back at the park, she finally asked what we were going to do, and we officially started dating. I told 2 people, she told 3-4 people. So fast forward, 2 weeks, she broke up with me very sincerly and I thought I was fine. I was indeed not fine, I cried 2 nights in a row but then got over that and the thought of lasted till school started up again. I have made it since August not really being upset about it all, I like a girl now and there is a chance I talk to her soon (wish my luck). But then suddenly, we played the wheel game again, the three of us, and memories from August came rushing back like a freight train, I felt really good again like I didn't have school and I was free, and was still dating her. Until I realized I wasn't, then finally I started getting upset for no reason and it is getting the better of me and I just want to beable to like one person without a constant bullet whole that was no one's fault in my chest. So please tell me what to do. Those few months were the best of my short and long roaded life ahead of me, I just don't understand what to do with this other girl with that constant bullet whole as I said."

I've felt like this for about a month now, not sad, not mad, just... ugh. Like any moment I could cry, but nobody i talk to would give me the response I want. On one side, I have my father whom I live with, who would say to man up. I have my mom who im not living with that would baby the fuck out of me, and I have my stepmother who I dont think would need this on her plate. So here I am. Typing on a screen to scream into the meaningless void of this media site. Honestly, im going my best, but is that enough? I have 2 siblings who im desperately trying not to play favorites with, that are the ages of 8m and 6f. The girl is the princess who gets whatever she wants, and the boy is the adult in the kids body, whom I love to death, and wish I had those childhood experiences with again. I really fucking want a job, and was supposed to be set up on a framing site (my dad doesn't believe in me working at McDonald's, a restraint, or anything but the trades) as of like 3 months ago, and I was hyped. Until the guy i called, whom was supposed to be employing me, didn't call back. Yay. Now I express that I dont care, and I want something to do other than go to school, and be at home to play games (im not social. Never have been, but I want to) but he says I need to focus on school right now. Im burning out, want a purpose more than school, as well as my own money to spend, which leads me into my next dilemma. We're poor. Like dont have the coffee, so I walk home for it everyday poor. Just lost the car, and got evicted from the apartment, and we're packing everything up, and its killing me. We're out as of early February, and everything I see boxes of stuff being put away, I want to cry. I hate it. Watching my siblings go through it kills me too. Seeing my brother throw out toys he doesn't want anymore hurts, as I see him part with things he probably wanted to keep. I dont have much, aside from a pc, my cloths, and a few other technological trinkets and my rollerblades. But im in this hell hole, and exams are happening, and im losing it. Im late on 2 out of my 4 culminating assignments, my parents dont know, and I hate everything about myself. We dont have the money for a gym membership, I am not allowed to get a job, because I have to help with my siblings and such, and im stuck longing for l something that feels so far away. Any advice? No, I cant get a therapist, because the last thing I want is my father knowing I need the help or some shit."

1qgoj9k,how to deal with a younger annoying sibling,Advice,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"my (16f) younger brother (14m) is incredibly annoying and idk what to do anymore. he keeps intentionally annoying me and then once i reach my breaking point he gets mad at me and i feel guilty so i apologise. every time i call him out and ask him “why are you annoying me” he always replies with “idk” or “it’s instinct”

he annoys me unprompted and genuinely just makes me want to bash his head against the wall. he makes these faces and like does the typical annoyance but does it continuously like he doesn’t stop. he does it even when im studying and for example we were watching a movie together and after we finished and i went on my phone, he took my phone and started trying to guess my passwords. i’ve told him to stop, i’ve literally fought with him, i slammed a door in his face, i didn’t talk to him for a week (his annoying got too much so i gave in) and i cried and screamed at him. my parents have yelled at him, they’ve lectured him (they’ve never taken his pc tho) and they tried to separate us but  it didn’t work.  he also pokes me a lot to get my attention and like throws a rubber/balloon football at my head (even though i’ve told him to stop) and his pokes hurt, like even in the shoulder or arm 

im so tired of this, and i can’t help but get annoyed every single time. he laughs when i confront him, and acts like he’s the victim by saying “can you stop yelling at me” immediately after he annoys me. it’s draining me so bad and im starting to hate him, like seriously hate him. he still wants to do movie nights, and i do too, but i can’t deal with him annoying me anymore. 

idk what to do, because my parents aren’t helping, and he says i annoy him, but when asked to explain further, he says the way i speak pisses him off, the way i walk, or the way i tend to “overreact” (me yelling when im surprised). his excuse to my parents (and their justification as well) is that i overreact and i have no patience. my mum always says stuff like “don’t annoy her, you know how much she overreacts” “leave her alone she’s a complicated person” “you have no patience (to me)” and how tf am i supposed to have patience after years of this yk. i’ve physically pushed him (he pushes me but to a lesser extent) and he’s started crying and i feel bad and apologise, and he says “im sorry i wont ever do it again” but the next day he immediately does it

idk what he wants, does he want attention, does he like it when im upset, does he just do it for the plot?? i need advice on how to like idk deal with this or at the very least reduce the amount of bs. this also happens in places like car share (where i can’t leave) or at parties (where i can’t “cause a scene” and he’s having “fun”). i genuinely can’t do this anymore."
1qgjgtw,my friend gets mad at me for sleeping in class,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"im a very sleepy person. i have no idea why, but no matter how much sleep i get the night before, i will always be able to take a nap right where i sit. especially in school because all my classes are super boring. the thing is whenever i act tired or try to put my head down for three seconds, my friend immediately starts acting as energetic as possible to try and 'keep me awake'. i usually humor her, but if i dare to act less engaged than she'd like, she gets all up in her feels and throws herself a pity party. 

this also goes for when i'd rather work on my assignment than hold the most useless unfunny forced conversation with her. i know it's normal and funny sometimes for your friends to mess with you while you try to do your work and turn your laptop off, write on your papers, take your pencil, but holy SHIT i cannot do a single assignment around her. mind you she's in almost all of my classes. i guess the title is exaggerated, she doesn't exactly get mad at me when i tell her to stop but holy shit she definitely doesn't listen. one time i was multitasking talking to her while working on my math and she threw a whole fit about how i'd rather do my homework than talk to her when she's putting herself in pain to be next to me (she was sitting on the floor next to me, she refused my offer to let her take my seat.) ...hello??? what the fuck are you talking about??? i'm at SCHOOL not hanging out with you??? nor did i even ask you to sit there?? like fuck you genuinely that made me so mad and i promise you i'm extremely slow to anger 🫩"
1qgli76,Please help me I really dont know what to with myself,Serious,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"So, I‘ll try to keep this short as I promised myself to go sleeping early today.

When i was 12 or something like that, it was corona and we all had to do school online yadda yadda y’all know.

Now the thing is, i was always a curios kid and I think at that time we had sex ed at school but i was sick of not knowing what it was all reallllyy like yk? So in my free time I started googling things related to sex and then at some point, I found a video where people were actually having sex.

My first contact with pornographic content.

I thought it was quite interesting and looked for it more often. I don’t really remember much but I think I spent really a lot of time exploring these websites and everything they offer; I was even bold (or desperate or naive?) enough to watch something like that during a family gathering once. On my mums phone. The next day she asked me about it (was in her history) but I managed to talk myself out of it (now ofc i wish I hadn’t). As I‘ve already said I don’t remember much, but ig sometime I just stopped watching that stuff and totally forgot abt it.

But then, maybe 1 or 1 1/2 years ago, I suddenly remembered all of that again and motivated by my curiosity and maybe need for connection (or whatever I don’t even understand myself atp), I started searching it up again. Most of the time, it was in the evenings and I was just reading a romantasy or romance book and then wanted to visualise what i was reading if that makes sense (?).

Now I know some ppl don’t judge this too harshly as „it’s normal to have these sexual feelings emerge as a teenager“, but I judge myself really really hard because I don’t want to have ANYTHING to do with all of this before marriage (am proudl religious) AND definitely not like this.

I often couldn’t control myself , went to sleep faaar to late, feeling hopeless, crying, full of regret and self loathing.

I tried everything: installed a dns that blocks these sites (problem is i can unblock them myself), motivate myself, ask that anonymous help call line.

It didn’t get muchhh better. (So for the record, i maybe do it once in two weeks or something).

Then I decided to tell my mum. She was so understanding and I couldn’t stop crying. She said, we would start by just not letting me have my devices at night and whenever I felt that inner voice saying „yeah, go, search it up“ i should call her or go to her or whatever. She also started asking me weekly if i had done it again. At first, i was just so happy and euphoric and hopeful, i was actually able to answer her honestly with a „no“. And i was actually „clean“, because ofc i didn’t have my devices and the possibility to do anything. Thing is, gradually it all got back to normal again, with me having my phone and ipad in my room again in the evenings, as i like reading manga on the phone or watching something or chatting… everything completely normal things one would like to do in the evenings.

But then… I did it again and again

Right now, I don’t know if my mum forgot (don’t suppose so) or is just assured that I am doing fine but she hasn’t asked for quite a while now. And its my third time this year now (yesterday night) consciously looking for explicit content.

Now I am

\- constantly afraid of myself in the evenings (like i cant just lie down in my bed with my phone and read or my ipad and watch something without being really scared)

\- still feeling so extremely disgusted by my actions and lack of self control

\- feeling guilty all the time, as I am not honest with my mum

\- afraid she’s going to ask and find out that i have in fact not been able to stop (I cannot lie to her face)

\- so damn clueless once again 😔

Thank you, if you actually read all of this, it’s of course longer than i intended it to be ♥️

So please help me out

What should i do? What could help me with self control? How do i help myself?

Anything would help, even just encouragement or a small advice"
1qgiinb,"To be honest, this is about more than just being an atheist.",Serious,Emotional Pressure,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"So when I was a younger I would lie about hearing and seeing things from God because I saw my family and people in church saying that they heard and talked to God.

Fast forward to today and I just told my Christian mom that I lied about hearing from God, and she screamed, got very upset, and said that I was lying and that if I wasn’t lying I was going to hell (also when I tried to defend myself she threatened to hurt me). Now I’ve been an atheist for years now but I haven’t told anyone and I was wondering if I should tell her but after today I’m not sure what I should do.

Note: I plan on going no-contact once I move out, as whenever I bring up any physical abuse and neglect that occurred when I was younger, she claims that it didn’t happen, she didn’t do it, and that I’m lying (and if I keep pushing she’ll eventually tell me to shut up or she will show me what abuse is) so I know that repairing our relationship is likely not possible.

Edit: just to be clear I don’t have any problems with Christian’s this post, per the title is about more than my religious views it’s about me and my moms broken relationship, her treatment of me is what pushed me to make this post."
1qghzwf,is he flirting with me (plz tell me no),Advice,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"(im 17F and he’s 17M btw) so there’s a guy that added me on snap and i thought i knew him so i added him back and basically immediately he called me. there i realized i in fact did not know him but i told myself yolo let me get to know this guy. we started calling and texting a bit for the past 3ish months and honestly i fw him but in a STRICTLY FRIENDS WAY. however some things he does or says makes me think otherwise.

first thing constantly compliments me. i know like it’s normal to compliment friends but it’s too a point where like gng i get it you find me pretty. on top of that he always asks to facetime and if my face is out of frame for more than 20 seconds bro starts basically begging me to show my face which like… thats kinda weird

secondly hes way too interested in my life and is pushy to know things he doesn’t need to know. he wants to know all my friends name, my adress, my phone number , my whole families dynamic , my mental health issues just everything. bro ppl ive know for years dont know this info calm down. and he gets annoyed that i dont ask these things abt him like bro i dont wanna know 😓

thirdly he keeps on bragging saying hes a perfect guy to date (word for word). he is not my type not physically or personality wise btw. i think hes too confident and mansplain too much, also hes not humble and he constantly flexes the amount of money he has and that he works a high position at his job at 17. one time he asked me my type and he just kept saying i fit that description perfectly … trust you dont. he also jokingly flirts a looottt.

maybe important info: we live like 2h away from each other. he just got out of a childhood gf thing where he was dating this girl since they were 13 i think and he’s still a bit in contact with her. he says how he never talks to girls and how she was the most important person in his life and blah blah blah (she ended up cheating on him)

so what should i do i beg. i never flirt with him or indulge in his « im perfect » delusions , i have a pretty aggresive/strong personality so i really never come off as flirty honestly. if he listens to me even a bit he’ll know that he’s not my type and i’d never date a guy like him but clearly the message hasn’t been delivered"
1qg9djp,I can't stand this bullshit,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I was telling my mother about the things that were happening around the world because that's what I usually do, and she started bringing up topics she wasn't educated in. I've done this before with her, so I stopped her and told her to educate herself before speaking because she would just get herself into arguments she didn't want to be in. And she said ""And?' Like motherfucker, YOU are the adult here, YOU should be telling me to stay out of arguments but instead you're trying to start shit. I've done this so many goddamn times, in so tired of it. You would think ""oh if you're tired of arguing,stop bringing it up"" but there is literally no one else I can talk to about this. Plus, this is about adult things, things she needs to know about because it comes up in conversation quite often (no, it was not about anything s3xual). I told her about things other people were saying to hopefully get her to realize that she was in the wrong, and she brought up the past- Which was inaccurate (literally basic history??). Like, I love my mom, but she is so fucking ignorant and it's actually painful to deal with. Every time I try to tell her something, it's always ""Well, let's agree to disagree."" or she'll try to come at me with what SHE knows, as if she isn't frequently wrong. I don't know why we keep doing this, it only leads to arguments. She knows I won't back down, and I know that she will continue to upset me. I love being smart and educated, but when it comes to dealing with ignorance, it makes me wanna get the hell OUT OF HERE. Because you can never win. You can't beat ignorance because they never care. I just want to EDUCATE my mother about important things, or even just start conversation and it always ends with a damn disagreement. What, now I feel bad for trying to share information??? I need to km$. I don't know if any of this made sense, but I'm not in the mood to correct anything. I feel like my dad. But I can't tell if that means that Im a bad person, or if it means my mother needs to make some changes with herself. We were talking about a death, and she turned it into an argument. I'm so done. What's worse is I have to spend time with her today, after that. I feel like I'm ruining things. Because now I'll be in a bad mood all day, and it'll only get worse throughout. That will make her upset, then my siblings will be upset and then I'll probably be having a talk with my psychiatrist again. Such bullshit. 67 or whatever the fuck people are saying now. This is so dramatic and stupid"
1qgh72b,How do I move from hanging out as friends to an actual relationship?,Advice,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"Hey everyone,  
I could really use some advice because I feel like I’m stuck between friendship and something more.

Me (M) and this girl (let’s call her Sarah) already have some history. A few months ago, during a festival, we made out. Her friend **Emma** and my friend **Jack** (all names are made up) were already there, so the four of us ended up hanging out together. We were all pretty drunk, and it was my first kiss ever, so I was very introverted and didn’t really know how to act.

After the festival, we all went to Emma’s place. On the way there, Sarah fell asleep with her head in my lap on the bus. Later, while watching something, we cuddled and fell asleep. Nothing sexual happened, just cuddling. I wasn’t lustful or anything, more just nervous and inexperienced.

The next morning, I didn’t really make a move or talk much because I was shy. Later, I heard from Emma that Sarah had a crush on another guy, so I assumed I had no chance and let things die out. After that, we saw each other a few times in the city but never really talked.

Fast forward a few months: Sarah randomly snaps me again, we start texting every day, and she asks if I want to meet up. We go out, and even though I wasn’t sure if it was a date or not, we ended up going for a walk and talking for **3 hours straight**. We have a lot in common: music, sports, movies, humor, etc. The vibe was really good and natural.

A few days later, I asked if she wanted to meet again, and she said yes very enthusiastically. The second meetup went even longer — **4.5 hours of walking**. I even asked if she wanted to sit or eat because my legs were completely dead, but she wanted to keep walking.

Both meetups went really well: no awkward silences, lots of laughing, deep conversations. The only issue is that nothing physical happened. We’re usually just walking, it’s cold, both hands in pockets, and I don’t really know how to escalate things naturally without making it awkward.

A lot of my friends say they think she wants something more too, and honestly, I feel the same way. The problem is that I’m not very good at picking up signs, and I don’t always know if she’s giving any — even though I’m pretty sure she is interested. I just don’t want to mess this up or slowly drift into the friendzone.

Now I’m planning to ask her out again, but I don’t know:

* how to make a move when we’re mostly just walking
* how to shift from “friendly hangouts” to relationship vibes
* whether inviting her over to play board games is too much too early
* or what the best next step even is

Any advice on how to escalate naturally without ruining what we already have?"
1qg82mu,I’m 16 years old but my parents don’t let me get a job,Advice,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"So I am 16 years old but my parents won’t let me get a job. They say they’re doing me a favor by not letting me work. They think I’ll get too tired from work and get bad grades because of that. I get good grades and told them that if my grades drop I’ll stop working but they just don’t care. 

I also told them that I want to work to be able to earn more money and to save more and to get work experience so that when I’ll go to college I’ll know how to balance school and work. 

I had a summer job when I was 15 years old but stopped when school started. My mom told me when I was 14/15 that I could get a job when I was 16/17 but it looks like they won’t even let me work at 17. 

I’ve tried to convince them so many times but my dad doesn’t even want to listen to me and starts yelling at me if I try to speak to him about it and when I talk to my mom she keeps telling me no and says that I can’t work bc my dad says I can’t.

What should I do? Did anyone have strict parents who didn’t let them get a job? If so, did you convince them and how? Thank you in advance!!"
1qg41mh,I lowkeynuinely just lost my best friend,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I don’t know how to feel about this friendship break up. The pain is not sharp and intense but more like a constant ache in my stomach and heart. We’ve know each other for 7 years.

She said that it was a lot of tiny stuff that accumulated over time that made her crack, I understand that fully. I’m the type of person that forgets or doesn’t notice stuff that happens. But I just feel like if she had said something sooner I would’ve changed? I’m not putting the blame on her, not at all. But I’m not the type to shut down or close off any criticism. I wonder if she chose to keep it in all that time, if so, I feel awful…like, she never felt comfortable enough to tell me what she didn’t like.

To add on top of that, she told me how a close friend of mine has been treating her, she said that it wasn’t that deep and that she didn’t care about my friend for it to get to her but still. I feel disappointed in myself for never noticing and my friend.

And to add insult to injury, she told me how disappointed she was about an event that happened recently and the way I reacted. She said that she thinks that we see the world differently now. That broke my heart the most. It felt so final. And I think that she won’t ever want to be my friend anymore. 

Talked about this to my mom but she just dismissed it as “girls problems” since it was our first time having a real argument.

I wish she told me clearly if she didn’t what to be friends anymore, I don’t know where we stand exactly. And I can’t just ask her  “So are we still friends?/ Can I still text you?”.

Man, 2026 is awful."
1qg5q6p,I feel weird about something,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So in recent times I've started dating a girl (we'll call her P for privacy). We are doing pretty great, we see eachother every day, we understand eachother, she comforts me with my problems and I do aswell with hers. We are also down to commit on something long term rather than casual, but since we are young we still do acknowledge the amount of efforts that would need. Everyone says we are a sweet couple, she loves me with all of her heart and so do I... But I can't help but feel like a pain in the ass to her.
I am and always have been a pretty delicate person when it comes to love: I always want to be comforted, babies, reassured, yk that type of thing. But especially for the past week or so I can't help but feel like she will lose interest in me over time because of this. I always need a shoulder to cry on, someone that can understand me, and she does reassure me that she will never stop being that someone. She does it with all of her honesty. So why do I keep feeling this? Why, even if I know that she wouldn't leave me, that she wouldn't get tired of me, a part of me that thinks the exact opposite keeps taking over and thinking otherwise... 
I need serious advice about this. I'll also talk about it with my psychologist, but yk I also wanted some advice from people that are my age or that have had a situation like mine. "
1qg3mc7,About my queen 👑,Other,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"(used ChatGPT for garmmer correction and to translate it to English from Hindi)

Hindi version available on the next slide "
1qg12z9,Based off of a movie I watched!!,Other,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"She spoke in rain,
and in the careful way her fingers trembled
before touching his sleeve.
The city never heard her,
but he did.
He learned her language early.
Not the kind made of sound,
but pauses.
Breaths held too long.
Eyes that lingered half a second more than normal.
Love, for them, was quiet.
And because it was quiet,
it was pure.

His mother called it a burden.
She wrote it slowly,
as if gentleness could soften the blade:
You are not fit for him.
He shouldn’t have to babysit you.
You are holding him back.
Each word landed louder
than any scream she could never make.
So she folded herself small,
packed silence into a bag,
and left.

The rain welcomed her better than people did.
Streetlights blurred like memories she wasn’t allowed to keep.
She walked without direction,
umbrella shaking,
heart louder than the city.
Somewhere else,
a phone buzzed in a man’s pocket.
I’m almost there, it said.
Wait for me.

She never saw it.
Metal screamed where she could not.
A bus slipped from the bridge,
light folding into water,
and the sea swallowed a future.
She saw it.
From far enough away
to know it was real
but close enough to feel it break her.
Her hands begged the phone for help.
Her mouth opened to nothing.
Panic drowned her before the water ever could.

The hospital smelled like endings.
A woman’s lips moved,
her pen did the damage.
He’s gone.
It’s your fault.
The world went quiet in a way
she had never known before.
This silence stayed.

The truth tried to arrive later.
A father’s message.
A kindness too slow.
She saw it with tears blurring the screen,
fought the rope,
fought the weight of words already believed.
Time won.
It always does.

He did not die.
He slept.
And in that sleep,
she finally returned.
Not as a voice.
Not as a body.
But as memory.
She walked through his coma
like a familiar hallway.
Sat beside him where no one could interrupt.
Spoke without sound.
Loved without resistance.
Here, no one called her a burden.
Here, no one erased her.

When he wakes,
they say he will remember a girl
he can’t quite describe.
Only the feeling
that he was never alone.


Series- try to guess:)"
1qg19h8,Idk if my crush likes me back…what should I do next?,Relationship,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"I (16F) like this guy (16M) from one of my classes who’s also the VP of coding club, and I genuinely cannot tell if I’m reading too much into things or if my anxiety is just messing with me.

Earlier in the year (before I knew I liked him) he specifically asked me multiple times to go to the coding club interest meeting. When I actually went, he came up and thanked me for coming, and then when I didn’t go to the next meeting he asked why. When I said I wasn’t sure I was fully joining, he kind of just went “oh…” and seemed disappointed. Again, at the time I didn’t think much of it.

In class, he’s vouched for me before too. During a chess thing, he told the teacher “she will not lie to you,” which stuck with me because it felt like he genuinely sees me as an honest person.

Lately I’ve been going to coding club more, and even though he’s supposed to walk around and help everyone, he mostly talks with his friends…but he still comes up to me specifically. One meeting, another coding leader had already asked me for help, and then he came up to me anyway to check in. The problem is that whenever he talks to me, my voice literally disappears. I freeze up, my throat tightens, and I give short answers even though I don’t want to. I told him I hadn’t started yet, and the convo kind of ended awkwardly.

When I was leaving that same meeting, he came up to me again and asked how it was going and told me I could message him on Remind if I had questions or problems. The thing is that earlier he had told the rest of the club to just use Google if they needed help. he didn’t offer that to anyone else, just me. Again though, I was super quiet and awkward and probably cut the conversation short without meaning to.

After that, we ended up walking toward the library at the same time. I was in front of his group, but they ended up leaving because there wasn’t enough space for all of them, which lowkey hurt even though I know that’s not personal.

What’s really messing with my head is that I was so quiet and closed off with him, but then I go straight to my next class and I’m totally normal, laughing and talking with my friend. I’m worried that if he likes me at all, seeing that contrast made him think badly of me or think I’m uninterested or fake or something.

Right after coding club in 3rd period, he also looked really down..like slumped over, staring at his computer, not laughing with his friends, which is super unlike him. I know that could be for a million unrelated reasons, but my brain keeps wondering if I somehow caused it even though that feels unlikely.

We don’t really catch each other staring anymore, but we still make eye contact sometimes. One time while he was talking to the whole club, he made eye contact with me and gestured for me to move to the front even though everyone was supposed to move anyway. He also recently changed his hair and I want to compliment it, but I’m scared of being awkward.

My biggest issue is that when I like someone, it takes weeks of low-pressure interaction before my real personality comes out. Right now I freeze and can barely speak, even though I’m totally normal around everyone else. I’m worried I’ve created a negative impression because of that, even though he keeps approaching me and offering help.

I honestly can’t tell if he was interested and is pulling back, if he’s just being nice because he’s a leader, or if I’m overthinking everything because I like him.

And also another problem is that our semester is changing and I don’t think I have ANY classes with him💔 I know there’s still coding club but it’s kinda sad going from seeing him 5 days a week to 1. I’m not sure what should I do next.

Should I message him going off of the last meeting, or should I just wait it out see if we have classes together.

(Also sorry this is so long already😭 but if anyone has some suggestions for getting my voice to work around him I would greatly appreciate it!)"
1qfxxj9,A thing happened (again),Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"putting this under rant I guess

  
anyway, for background, a few months ago a friend (for the sake of this ill call her belle) of mine, just started ignoring me out of the blue, I sent a few texts that were essentially, I don’t know what I did wrong, can we fix this. the last of these was me flat out pleading for acknowledgment of any kind, she left me on read every time, and took a screenshot of the last one.  other people in the friend group tried (I don’t know how hard) to help  but couldn’t. at one point me and three other people in that group sat down, ashley (again not real name for privacy reasons ig) essentially gave me a crappy excuse for belle’s behavior and told me to “just make some new friends” so that happened

later I fucked up some more and ashley asked for some space, so I am out of the friend group for sure at this point



now that was all months ago, in the past month I’ve had around three points where I’ve talked to Ashley (she tapped me on the foot at one point to get my attention which was weird) around 3 times. (never intentionally) 

  
so to the new thing, today my friend told me that Ashley and belle had some kind of fight. Where belle is sitting with her friends and Ashley comes in and starts yelling at belle, saying things like “you can’t keep doing this to people“  and “you need to learn how to communicate” and just cussing her out. my friend also tells me that belle had been ignoring Ashley without reason or context, and Ashley had texted a few times, telling her that she didnt know what she did and she wanted to try and work things through. (sounds mighty familiar) every time belle left her on read

so that is a thing that happened 

i know no one is reading this shit but whatever

1qft4k5,Advice for toxic friend (tldr included),Advice,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"I (Ophelia, 15) am writing this post in collaboration with my friend (Kiah, 15) who is also involved in this in order to ask for advice. I encourage you to read the full post, but all paragraphs under ‘Minor things’ can be skipped. I also included a TLDR if you can’t read all of this. I’ve asked for advice from many adults in my life, but many integral elements of this story relate to my sexuality and others’ that is currently not safe for me to do. Sorry for this being a long ahh post, I didn’t mean it to be 😭.

Beginning

I was ‘friends’ with Laura for many years. The friendship was very strained since I always felt like she was more invested in me than I was in her. My parents always forbid me from outright telling her that I didn’t want to be friends. In the beginning of our 6th grade year, she got very into a book series that includes gay characters. Soon after, she came out as a bisexual. I initially thought that she found herself in this book and I was so happy for her. But soon after it would get really creepy. I had another friend, Griffin, who is gay. She became literally obsessed with him and his boyfriend and he was super uncomfortable with her. This was the beginning of my bad feelings towards her.

Minor Things

This section will only describe minor things. These aren’t very serious, just things that both me and Kiah find upsetting and not good traits in a friend. These aren’t the things we necessarily need advice on, just things that might help in giving your advice. Skip to Serious Things if you’d like the more important things.

She makes a lot of fat jokes with us. Both me and Kiah are skinny-ish and Laura is chubby. Both me and Kiah struggle with body image issues. (Body dysmorphia😭) It’s really upsetting when Laura makes jokes like that because it actually hurts when she says it. I make those jokes with Kiah, but I also make sure to let them know they're pretty. It just feels weird when she makes those jokes because she actually calls us fat. Kiah only calls me those things because we know it's only a joke and we both don't think we're fat.

She constantly interrupts our conversations. Not just talking when there’s a pause, she fully starts talking to us while I’m in the middle of talking. We just trail off and give her a short answer and go back to talking, since what she says is in no way related to what we were just talking about. She gets super sad and kind of looks down at the table and waits for us to notice it. It feels more like she’s trying to make us say: “What’s wrong Laura?” instead of communicating and opening a productive discussion. When she interrupts us, she always talks about herself. It’s really tiring to only have conversations about one person, especially when she talks about the same things over and over again.

We are all in the theatre club. Our show this year is Beauty and the Beast, and I play Belle, Kiah plays Mrs. Potts, Laura is set crew. She talks on and on about how our theatre director is ‘pushing her aside’ and ‘ignoring the set crew’. The reason she feels this way is because our director told the set crew…. To paint the set… while the actors… act?? She also talks about how it’s not fair that the younger/less experienced actors come to us (the older/more experienced actors) instead of set crew. It’s incredibly annoying that no matter how hard I try to explain to her that someone who has never been on a stage, doesn’t know how to help younger kids with STAGE FRIGHT. She also gets so mad that no one will let her help with hair/makeup, even though we haven’t even started thinking about it outside of loose ideas. It also might be that these actors don’t know her well, since we’re older than them and they’ve never met her before. Personally, I would not let anyone I don’t know touch my hair or makeup.

After she got over her crushes on me and Kiah, she was trying to find any girl who would be her girlfriend. I think it was less about finding someone who she actually liked, and more about finding anyone. I tried to tell her that only dating someone for the sake of it is a recipe for disaster, but she just said: “You wouldn’t understand because you have someone” and then she just rolled her eyes at me.

Serious things

These are the real uncomfortable things she’s done that we would like an outsider’s perspective on. My parents never let me be firm on anything or stand my ground, so I feel like much of their advice is just going to be to ‘sit around and wait for her to get a message’, which is not very effective. As I said at the beginning I can’t talk openly about most of the things in this story because my home isn’t very welcoming.

Kiah and Laura were in the same Spanish I class last year. Laura and Kiah sat next to each other at the same table. Kiah is a hardworking student; they always try hard and do their best on assignments. Laura is just a cheater, who just skates by in Spanish class by copying Kiah’s answers. She will lean over dividers during assessments to copy their answers. In our school, if someone is caught cheating, sometimes the person they cheated off will get in trouble too. Kiah had to ask their teacher to separate them in class because it was so stressful and annoying for them. This school year, they have different periods for Spanish II. Laura’s only complaint was: “Now I can’t cheat off you, haha.”

She dislikes it whenever I talk about guys and tries to steer the conversation back to girls. I’m bisexual, and I have a preference for men. She hates that for some reason. I had crushes on several guys and whenever I mentioned liking men at all, she would roll her eyes. This coupled with the fact that she would always call me a lesbian really upsets me and makes me feel like she doesn’t really support me. The few times I’ve spoken up for myself and tried to talk to her about it she denies it and says something like: “I know but like… I just think you’re a lesbian.” ???? Tf does that even mean?? You can’t just decide what other people’s sexualities are??

Anytime me and Kiah do “gay things” (eg: grab each other’s thighs, or lean in really close/cuddle), she just points at us and says: “Gay!” (Even when we don’t do anything, she still says that to us individually) We’ve tried explaining that we’re just best friends and that it’s not romantic, but she doesn’t get it and keeps telling us we’re gay. Kiah is the only person I feel comfortable touching/hugging and it’s really uncomfortable when she says stuff like that. I am bisexual and Kiah is biromantic; We both lean towards men and would not date a woman.

We are all in the theatre club. Our show is Beauty and the Beast, and I play Belle, Kiah plays Mrs. Potts, Laura is set crew and another one of our friends: ‘Noah’ is the Beast. Noah is straight, he’s said it so, so many times, but Laura doesn’t care. She keeps making jokes about how he’s gay because he’s in theatre. He’s uncomfortable and honestly all the rest of us are too. It furthers the idea that straight men can’t enjoy theatre which is an extremely dumb take. I tried to talk to her about it, but she said, “I know, I know, but have you seen the way he acts? That doesn’t set off your gaydar?” It’s incredibly frustrating that every time I’ve tried to bring up something to her, she just shuts it down instead of listening to me.

She had a crush on me and Kiah (at different times). When she had a crush on me, I had a ‘boyfriend’ (I was 12 so it wasn’t really serious). I didn’t find out directly from her, someone else told me. I politely turned her down and told her I was dating someone. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she didn’t know. Even after this she kept pushing and pushing and never took no for an answer.

She would constantly talk about how she was so lonely because she didn’t have a girlfriend. I tried to respond with the most patience I could, but it’s very difficult when she brings it up every few minutes. She eventually implies that I could be her girlfriend. I laugh it off even though I don’t feel very good inside. She continues to push about wanting me to date her until she finally gets the message that I don’t like her.

After this she starts going after Kiah. She is way, way more aggressive with them. She copies literally everything they do– jokes they make and even their identity. There are several ‘in-jokes’ that Kiah makes that Laura has tried to say that she came up with. Kiah says it’s really frustrating and uncomfortable that she just copies any joke that they and I have, even when she wasn’t even there for the event that the ‘in-joke’ derives from. The more serious aspect of the uncomfortable copying is that she copies every identity label Kiah has. When Kiah is NB, she is too, when Kiah is ace, she is too. Kiah is really uncomfortable with it, rightfully so.

\*Tw: SH, this part is serious, but if this upsets you please skip it– be safe! &lt;3 :)\*

Both me and Kiah struggle with SH and Suicidal thoughts. I have improved significantly with Kiah’s help since we’ve been friends :). Kiah wears a necklace with a safety pin on it, and it’s really special to them. Laura has made a few very poor taste jokes about SH to both of us. She also told us that she was struggling with it too and even began to wear the same necklace as Kiah. We were supporting her and telling her she should talk to someone, but she just said she was ‘joking’ and she actually wasn’t having any of those thoughts at all. Now all her jokes about wanting to khs leaves a bad taste in my mouth, even though I feel like I might be being immature.

TLDR;

Laura has been a bad friend in many ways, but she has recently been very pushy with romantic gestures, has told me ‘I seem like a lesbian’ despite not being one, doesn’t believe that our friend is straight and keeps saying he’s gay even after he’s told her himself, and has made really poor taste jokes about me and Kiah’s SH.

Thank you so much for reading something this incredibly long 😅. I have no idea how to bring up my feelings with her because I’ve never done something like that before. I (Ophelia, or Beautiful Outside 42)  am the one writing, but this will be posted on Kiah’s account since I don’t have an alt account and I don’t want to post my friendship drama on my main.

(Kiah speaking now) I wanted to say that any and all advice is appreciated as this has been going on for a very long time. Also, this is Kiah’s account just in case anyone didn’t know."

1qfil70,My mom makes me feel guilty,Rant,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"My mom constantly makes me feel like crap and I’m honestly pissed. She hates on my friends for being “low class” or “drug-like” even though she doesn’t know them at all. She just assumes the worst.

What gets me the most is how she completely misunderstands my personality.I’m talkative and social with other people, but around her I shut down because I don’t feel comfortable. Instead of trying to understand that, she keeps insisting I’m “quiet” or “shy” just because she only sees the version of me that exists around her. I told her about this but she does not listen

She also thinks I don’t study enough no matter how much I try. Nothing I do is ever enough for her. Every effort I make gets twisted into something negative.

I worked hard to get out of a depressive hellhole, and her constant criticism is dragging me back down. I’m tired of being judged, misunderstood, and controlled. I don’t know how to deal with her anymore."
1qffpgy,Can you help?,Advice,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"So there is my crush we will call her S. And to understand the story better : we are very good and we both like each other its just not official. so yesterday, me and her were talking like normal , then i asked whatcha doin to which she said do you know a guy ( we will call him B) , i said yeah i know , she said he msged first and they are talking. at this time i felt very angry at B , i completely trust S but that guy B is very weird and annoying. so i was telling her that he isnt a good guy just block him , she said there is a thing like human decency you cant just block anyone , to which i agreed. then i was very angry at him and i said smth i shouldn't have. i said to S that are u keeping him as a side man for yk flexing that you have someone under your fingertips. then she got very angry and said ""do you think i talk to you because you are under my control"" and ""i finally got to know what you actually think about me"" its my mistake clearly, and yeah thats what i said . the reason is that she looks just like a dream , like the prettiest dream you can have , and i always thought that she is just being nice and she is way out of my league. then i asked do you think that i was just acting all along of loving you, to which she said yes , not until this very moment. i cant blame her but i want her to be open.. i dont know what to do anymore, i cant think , cant study , idk what's happening to me. then today , she was normal , she started conversations too , but in the evening, she sent me a reel , which was about being happier alone than being with people who act like they love you but actually they hate you and you should stay away from that person for them to realise your worth. i was devastated by this reel and i asked if she hates me and just acts all sweet , to which she said i dont act but i dont love you either , especially since yesterday. then i tried to call but she said she doesnt wanna talk. i have sent her messages but she keeps ignoring me. please help anyone i dont know what to do and nor do i have any people to talk about except this community."
1qfb4jl,How do I know if my crush likes me?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),He’s super introverted barely talks to anyone. He’s the smartest guy in our whole school and gets good grades naturally without trying. We have a mutual girl friend who he’s known longer for than he has known me and she told me he barely ever texts her or has full conversations with her but he texts me by himself and has full conversations with me. He also tried to brag a bit to me this one time. All my friends think he’s into me because he barely talks as much as he talks to me to anyone else. We’re always laughing when we’re together. This one day he randomly texted me asking me for help with something and that was the first proper conversation we ever had and he’s the type of guy who never talks to anyone that way like asking for help or talking about himself. The only reason I think I don’t have a chance though is because I keep hearing if a guy likes u he will stare at u or maintain eye contact but this guy does neither of those things but he just talks to me by himself and like banters.
1qfcg19,"I can’t focus, feel constantly heavy, and I miss my ex years later.“I’ve been stuck missing the same girl for 2 years and it’s breaking me. Advice please do i have adhd or depression im willing to share more after this please message i will reply to everything. Looking forhelpsorryifthissoundscringe",Advice,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"Hey, this is my first post. I thought that i could keep this in me but i really need help. This is regarding my mental health and i want your guy's opinions on this.

So all of this starts of in 6th grade where i had i crush on a girl,this was after online classes and we used to frequently talk then when i got to know that she has feelings for me , it all increased for her but suddenly she started to think of me as a friend, she stars to like a few guys in our class whom i start to talk to (also if youre wondering how im getting this info its from one of my closest homegirls) all of these ive known in past classes also shes a knew student whose joined in 6th. So she starts to tell me about how she likes this biy and basically in my mind i want to date this girl so i start to compete with the guy and start to become a bit edgy and rude like him, basically all my fiends noticed this and my friendships started ruining.

Then at the end of 6th grade she likes me back again and we start to talk again we didnt talk as much for a few months , so at the start of 7th grade i basically become a popular kid ( I went to music competitions , my voice was really sweet, I become part of the school cricket team, I get the third highest grade at the end of the year couting the average of every exam and get the second highest grade in english, science that year even tho i wasnt able to get 1st it was still a really great academic time i mean i wasnt a tryhard and was really happy, ) So basically ive been good in academics and music since my childhood and now our school has these things called cca's once a week for 2 hours (extra curricular) aside from 1 music period a week so this girl also likes music and we both have muic vocal since 6th grade now at that time our school arranged alot of assemblies and the choit had to sing so we were called everyday for practice and we started to form a really great connection , then during a trip in 7th she holds my hands for thefirst time infront of the whole friendgroup and hugs me. So basically us 10 kids had alot of fun so like 5 boys 5 girls and everyone started to date one another not me during this time and this was the time where i got close w/ the 5 females , i had known them they were my friends but all 10 of us got closer now the girl i liked was in another section so me and my girl-best friend would go to meet her everyday.

SO basically i knew everyone in class everyone loved me and I was the multi-talented popular kid at school, so then (ill skip some friendship parts but try to cope up really sorry) I developed this kind of thing idk what it is where if i make eye contact w someone i dont like or say the same words at the same time or step 2 times somewhere it feels asif ive switched personalities idk how it got so developed in my brain suddenly, I was an introvert but in 7th because all of the attention form boys , girls , teachers , seniors i talked alot. Now idk this might be ocd or adhd or smthing

Near august I start to get close with the girl and we hug everyday we talk everyday basically im her best male friend (were not dating) the whole school knows i like her everyone knows she likes me.

Now as too why I liked her so much is she was the first girl i hugged , she was the first girl that made me feel loved and cared she treated me fair and she was so pretty and sweet.

Now I confess my feelings to her on december 21, 2023. And she says , yes and now i feel like im on top of the world , exceling in academics and sports , my music levels are through the roof and i feel perfect.

So we had an inter house tournament on 22 and we win the finals, my team wins and I celebrate, I wanted to become A cricketer or A data scientist back then and thought that ill succeed , the friend group was at its peek and it felt that everyone was gonna marry each other and were all gonna be successful.

As to why 22 is important is when i hold her hands she doesnt hold them back if you understand what im saying and i feel a bit off, she playes badminton and lost her final match and i thought that was the reason to it.

So on 23 when everyone was gonna get awards (award ceremony for sports day). We had to sing and and choir was practicing and im taling to my hoemgirl telling her then i see her and i got to hug her and she say politely what the heck as in why did you come to me so fast

Now my homegirl and her are bestfriends and she wispers something in her ears and 15 mins later she tells me that the girl wants to break up. For almost 2 years the girl whom i thought of everyday wanted to leave and I started crying, I wnet to my homies (5 boys) and dont tell them anything wiped my tears before they could see them and skipped practice before the song. Now when i go to sing in the choir my position is right beside her and she doesnt even look at me she almost hides her face.

I tried not to tear up on stage and from 24 winter break starts. Now break-ups start to heppen in our friend group aswell, which makes everything very wierd and uncomfortable now after 7th finals (which i cooked) 7th grade ends and on the last day i ask her if we can stay friends, mind you its been 2 months since our breakup in feb and our relation only lasted 2 days , I was to scared to talk and she didnt care enough. She says yes and on the first day of 8th grade i think shes gonna approach me , a week passes by and its music class time and we have to perform an old song on stage for the reopening so i come the the stae at last and shes on the first line near the entrance of the stage and puts her hand in a position to dap so i dap her up ,and thought that alr maybe shes gonna approach me now i get to know from my friends that she likes another boy now what happens is that our friend group splits in sections and 1-2 leave so its falling apart but i still as being the starboy,funniest kid decide to make everything alright.

1qf9lrv,I (16 M) don’t know what to do abt my talking stage (14F),Advice,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"How do I handle this?

Alright this is gonna be a long one. This has been keeping me up at night and I feel like it’s time to reach out and get some advice from people, basically me and her met on Snapchat and started snapping about 7 months ago, I didn’t know her age when I first met her and I have always been opposed to dating more then a year apart, and whenever I find out someone is more then year apart I usually unadd them and put them completely out of the question. But when I met her I found out she was 2 years and 2 months younger then me, I didn’t run away, I wanted to, but something made me stay, fast forward 7 months later to today and me and her are still talking. She’s genuinely perfect, from head to toe, every time I see her walk up to meet me or send me a photo of herself in the mirror I am in awe, and she is honestly the most kind, honest, and patient person I have ever met. She makes me so happy and I could talk to her for hours without getting bored. She has been there for me every single day since I’ve met her, we call every night and I have hung out with her about 7 times ( it’s hard to see each other as a secret ) even after 7 months of talking every day i have only told my closest friend and I can’t bring myself to tell my parents.

My mom is 43 and my dad is 41 (2 years 5 months age gap) but they really expect me to do what’s best for myself and they both think people ages should touch etc, me and my parents are close and they are nice and understanding (don’t worry you can tell us anything and we’ll figure it out type) but I have no idea how to bring this up or anything like it, I care so much about what my parents think and now I’m stuck in the middle because I can’t go on with the secret relationship forever. I want someone I can see lots in real life and not have to hide it, but I also don’t want to disappoint my parents and would love to have their approval. But I think it will be really hard to get because  the girl I like is younger then my sister who is 14 (1 year 9 months age gap) I feel like they would constantly compare my sister to the girl I’m talking too and that would cause them to dislike it. I just toss and turn over this every night because I truly like the girl I’ve met so much, nobody even appeals to me like she does and we can’t do this forever so I’m at a point where I have to make up my mind. It’s just so hard because on one side I feel disgusted knowing my parents aren’t going to like it, and on the other I feel disgusted knowing I’m to much of a bitch to stand up for my feelings towards her when I feel so strongly. If anyone has any advice I would really really appreciate it."

1qe1g2l,"I have the flu and I’m pretty sure it’s spreading EVERYWHERE at school, I have NO way to warn them.",Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"A girl in my school mentioned that everyone in her house was sick, however she only had “allergies”. I sat with her in class. Turns out later that day she got very, very sick and had to go home early. The next day, I woke up with the worst fever ever, I immediately texted my friend (around 7 AM, she wakes up at 6) and turns out she was sick too!! Keep in mind it is map testing week.

I woke up the next day horribly after vomiting at 2 am, my mom immediately took me to the hospital. Apparently I have strep throat and the flu which are both HIGHLY contagious. I’m coming back next Monday. I went to get amoxicillin which I know need to take 2 times a day for 10 fucking days. I came home around 11 AM and school doesn’t end until 3 PM, since then I’ve been blowing up my friend’s phone and telling her to 1. Go to the hospital and 2. WARN THE OTHERS. I have NO idea how many people are sick and if it would even be safe on Monday. She has not responded at all. Now I need to stay locked away in my room and I can’t even have my dog in since I could also get him sick.

Moral of the story: people who come to school sick fucking suck. "
1qdpy49,My parents are gonna make me lose it i swear,Rant,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Okay so basically a summary of whats been happening:

My parents: if you dont pick up a good talent, youre gonna end up a loser, you fuckin weirdo. One of your friends does piano, the other does singing and guitar and does so many school plays, and all your friends are in after school clubs and hangouts while youre just in your room doing nothing

Also my parents when i was a kid and wanted to try gymnastics: I mean, youre gonna needa be skinnier and i know by saying this im just fueling you to eat more because you wanna disobey me after i hurt your feelings because youre a kid and dont know how to process criticism or bad feelings you little shit but still. Im also gonna say that the teachers are way too harsh, that youre not good enough for it and scare you from it

When i wanted to do ballet as a kid: same thing with gymnastics, kiddo. But you seem real adamant on this so im gonna try to see- oops, the agency i contacted actually isnt a ballet school and really a music one! Good luck next time, kid.

When I wanted to do writing: I really encouraged you on this and im glad youre doing this! Lemme see your entry to the competition- Oh! Hey kid, this is absolute shit and I know youre 10 and your teacher said multiple times youre great at writing but this is bullshit. I mean, seriously, what the fuck is this? Im gonna scream at you now about how absolutely talentless you are and hope thatll get you to lock in.

When I wanted to do crochet: Oh, I bought you the wrong wool? Too bad. Use it or eat shit. Im not buying you anymore. Oh, you quit! Great job at dissapointing everyone againnnnn

When I wanted to try violin or piano: Haha, no! Do we look like elon musk to you? That craps expensive

When i wanted to do after school activities: yeah no i dont have time to drive you there or wait until way after the normal school time

When I wanted to do scouts: 1. EXPENSIVE!! 2. Look what your friend's mom said about it! She hates it!! Oh your friend said its actually not that bad and good? WHATEVER!!

When I wanted to try guitar: Oh wow, ANOTHER expensive hobby! I know im doing much better financially now and the guitar lessons happen right next to our house and I do infact have time to do that but yknow what?? Im gonna tell you you have to memorise a bunch of quran to get it, even though youre stressed about school and your deteriating confidence and social life and just wanted to do guitar to have skmething to pass time instead of having to add paragraphs of quran ontop of all your exams and schoolwork!

When my younger sisters asked for gymnastics: sure, sweetie, anything you want!! My baby is soooo ambitious!! And if anyone says anything trying to bring you down, ignore them and keep going!! Im gonna pay and drive you to those lessons!! Great job youre so talented unlike your bitchy older sister!!

My parents: you need ro be more social. Everytime i open the school whatsapp group, all your classmates are hanging out. Why are you such a loner?

Also my parents when i ask if i can hang out with my friends: what? Does she have a brother? Father? Why do you wanna go with her? What will you do? You remember your old friend who was mean to you 6 years ago, right? You want the same thing to happen again? Why would you need friends? Most people are just so self serving anyways. Nobody is actually friendly to anyone who isnt their family. Are you sure they actually care about you and arent just jealous? Fine, ill let you go but only ONCE this year

Im probably overreacting. Maybe teenager hormones and all that and im just not emotionally mature and my parents arent actually that bad but man does this SUCKKK. I also dont even know if i can trust my own memory because everytime i bring these bad moments up they deny saying anything so i dont know if my brain is just making things up to make me feel better abiut being this talentless but man does it suck to watch all my friends do the hobbies ive always wanted to do and their parents pay for them and all that. Im the oldest sibling in my famioy, which means i also have to watch my sisters get the childhood id always wanted. And dont get me wrong, im happy theyre happy but it sucks and i cant help but feel jealous. Not like a vengeful angry typa jealous more like just a sad type of jealous. And i know my parents try really hard to get money and make us happy and all that but I just wish they spent some of it to actually give me some form of teenage life? Idk it sucks. and because of this laired with a lot of other things they did, im dependant on them for every decision i make and i cat trust myself to do anything and willhave near panic attacks if i have a big decision and cant get them to pick for me

Does anyone else have this issue??"
1qdaft1,What Can Students Do When Part-Time Jobs Are Failing Us?,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I’m a student working part-time as a cashier and customer service employee at a grocery store, and I want some help on what to do in my situation and how i can help others. The store is fairly new and sales have dropped, so upper management cut hours, but my department manager severely overhired, around 38 people in customer service, which has left almost no hours available. Full-time staff are getting about 15 hours a week, and some part-time students are getting as little as 4 hours every two weeks. My manager refuses to approve transfers to other departments or locations, has told employees they “can’t quit,” and has taken shifts she already scheduled me for and reassigned them to herself just days before I was supposed to work. She is also frequently on the phone during shifts and often is not available when staff need support. I’m trying to figure out whether I should go to HR, contact the labour board, or just quit.

At the same time, I’m realizing that while my manager’s behavior is a personal issue, the bigger problem many students are facing is how hard it has become to find part-time work at all. Even leaving a bad job is risky when there are so few opportunities available, and that pressure keeps students stuck in unhealthy situations. I know I am not the only student struggling with this (finding a job) , and I want to figure out how we can work together to prevent this growing problem from getting worse. I want to help other students who are having a hard time finding a job, not just vent about it. Who do we bring this issue to? Is it schools, employers, labour boards, or youth organizations? How do students actually make their voices heard and create change around something like this."
1qdesok,I think my mum is emotionally abusing me (F15). I want to cut her off in the future. Any advice on what I can do in the future?,Serious,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"When my dad left my mother to move to Australia, my mother kept threatening to send me to Australia to live with my dad when I didn’t want to. This asserted control over me emotionally, by making me scared. These threats occurred from when I was 10 year old to 13 years old, when I fianally stood up for myself. 

In 2024 my mother said I looked like a man because of my facial hair - I get my face threaded and waxed like every 2 months now.

Before my mum found out I had suicidal ideation, she started ignoring me before our trip to Australia to visit my dad, because she was angry at me about something that I don’t recall. I was in my room on the floor thinking about killing myself. I started laughing and smiling to myself about the thought of dying. I kept repeating to myself “I want to die” multiple times, then later kept saying “I’m going to die” and laughing. I felt happier after I thought about killing myself because I wouldn't have to deal with my mother.

Before my first counselling session with another counseller after my mum found out that I had suicidal ideatation, she picked me up early from school. I could tell that she was angry at me for going to counselling. She kept being angry towards me even at home, and kept yelling at me. I cried and shouted at her to stop yelling. I felt like she was angry that I had self exit ideation. After we came home from the counselling session, she was still angry towards me and went to my parent teacher interview. She seemed more calm after. The next time I had counselling, it became my last time, because I didn’t feel like she supported me going to counselling, even though I had self exit ideation. She kept saying things like and similar to “I am not paying for the other counselling sessions after you finish the free ones”, which made me feel discouraged and even more suicidal.

The first time I played volleyball for my school was in term 4 2025. I wore my volleyball uniform which consisted of shorts and a singlet given to the volleyball and netball players of the school. I felt confident wearing it and I thought I looked good in it. My mother said to wear my hoodie over my singlet because according to her I looked chubby and fat. When I refused to, my mother used derogatory commentary towards my body and said in the car something similar to, if not, the same as “You think you’re all that”. When she said “you think you’re all that” I think that she referred to me having confidence in wearing shorts and a singlet as someone who was curvy and slightly chubby. I think that she intended to ruin my confidence and body image with that statement.

On multiple occasions my mum keeps saying that I’m fat, big, chubby, and that I have big legs. I don't think my legs are that big. I just have thick thighs.

She has physically abused me before too, its just too many times for me to remember. Overall, I used to think that I had a good relationship with her but I just can't kid myself anymore.

I think that she keeps calling me fat because she's jelous, and she always gets called fat by her friends. I have heard of mothers being jelous of their daughters, so this is possible. 

She literally doesn't have a single bone in her body that can compliment me. Whenever I dress up nicely, she always just stares at me in a way that conveys jelousy.

I want to go to law school in the future in a different country, and my dad says that he will pay my college tuition costs and everything. I want some advice on what I can do once I move overseas for college, and validation that she is emotionally abusive. I just don't know what to do. I know I can't prevent her actions. I don't want to call the police or tell a counseller or Child services. Wtf can I do at this point.

1qdcq58,sad about the end of a relationship that never started,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"so in September of 2025 i really liked this girl and we were on a school camping trip on an island and i told my friends i liked her and they told her

she said she didn’t really know me but one of my friends convinced her to get to know me

next 4 months went by pretty meh, we kinda talked everyday but i my gut told me she didn’t really like me back and honestly that really hindered things for me, but she told my friends she liked me and my friends talk to her so i believed her and not my gut, still not sure if that was the right choice, still had that feeling that she didn’t tho. talking to her was really awkward because i don’t usually talk to girls and i was extremely nervous and we both felt like we were kinda forced to talk to each other daily and it was always just small talk and never deep stuff

to absolutely nobodys surprise she said shes not ready for a relationship yesterday. but i feel like if i couldve done slightly better it wouldve been something bigger. especially since my friend showed me a screenshot of a message from her to my friend saying that our conversations are incredibly awkward. she said she thought it would be easier but it turned out to be very hard and emotionally impacting which i think i was the main root cause of.

i keep telling myself that it was just a really long talking stage and we don’t really have anything in common besides from both of us playing an instrument but i still can’t shake the feeling that i messed it up for her somehow. how do i get over this? please don’t say corny shit, already tried it and they do nothing to help me cope through. i know for some people it might not seem that deep because it was just a talking stage, kinda, but it really is. it was the first time i’ve had a crush on someone and made a move on that person and that person saying that they like me back, truthful or not. i just think it was a really good opportunity and if i just tried a lil bit harder it might’ve moved on. how do i get over this?

yes this is a burner account made just for this post. not sending this to my friends and instead posting on reddit because they’ll all just shame me for getting all emotional over a talking stage that was pretty much bound to fail from the way things were going"
1qdcqfx,Showing love?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"My gf feels unloved by me and doesn’t feel connected to me because of that and I don’t know what to do. We have different love languages, and for too long I’ve been showing love in my language instead of showing it in a way that she needs it to be shown. Her love language is gift giving and words of affirmation. There’s some roadblocks I guess that prevent me from showing her love in these two ways and I would really appreciate some help. I know one way that I could show her would be writing her letters, and while I have done that in the past, I’m not a good or fast writer. I always get an A in English but honestly it’s the weakest subject because I suck at writing. I never seem to find the write (pun intended) words, and on the rare occasion I do it’s usually after at least 30 minutes of just thinking. For any writers out there, some writing tips would be nice. I’m really slow when it comes to doing my homework, and right now I’m currently working on my time management but even then, writing a letter takes me over an hour (just words no drawings) when it should be taking me less. This has made me lose a lot of sleep and I can’t keep losing sleep, I need to stay awake in my classes so I can be successful and spoil my princess in the future. I need tips on putting ur thoughts into words please. Now for the issue with gift giving. Me and my gf are both girls and my parents don’t know we’re together. I came out to them last year during September and I told them that I really liked my gf (as in they think I only have a crush on her but not dating her) and they didn’t take it well. They had a conversation with me and that was the first time I had ever seen my dad cry. My parents didn’t say anything like “ur gay? Yeah no get out of my house ur disowned” or anything like that but they still weren’t 100% supportive. They think that this is a phase. Why is this a problem? Because the reason I told them was so I wouldn’t have to hide my gf and so I could love her openly and buy her gifts. My parents always get into my business and they question everything I do. Getting gifts is insanely hard for me to do because my parents are the only way I can go to stores or online shop (I’m 16 with no license yet I can’t drive myself unfortunately and my parents won’t take me driving to get my 50 hours that are required). Another issue is the fact that I share a room with my little sister. She’s really nosy as well as unable to keep her big mouth shut. This is a problem bc I also want to make my baby little arts and crafts but I’m so scared that my sister will catch me and my parents will find out. She’s 9 btw, I’m scared of a 9 year old catching me fml. Does anyone have any ideas for how I can buy my girl gifts without my parents finding out? There’s some details I left out (bc I don’t wanna get too personal) so some ideas might not work but I’ll take anything I’m so desperate. I want her to feel all of the endless love I have for her and I want her to be happy. Thank you for reading I’m sorry I yapped a bit and I’m sorry if this sucks, I’m not the greatest writer."

The dream thing had happened once thats it. But i have fallen asleep minimum 30-40 times without noticing. 

Also i told my mom. She said i just need to put my phone away. For reference i take medication and that medication can keep me up (Its an ADHD med) and she just thinks i should sleep more and it will fix my problem. She doesn’t understand ITS NOT THAT FUCKING EASY! She blames it on me and says if i tried sleeping more maybe i wouldn’t be as tired instead of addressing I have an issue that can be life threatening (If i fall i could hit my head on the faucet or other things around a bathtub/shower. 
She said i should set an alarm for 1 minute in. No thats dangerous if i get startled i may fall. 

Also i am falling asleep within 20-30 seconds of being in the shower. It happens when i blink i think. I cant sleep sometimes i just lay in bed and do nothing else. Also putting my phone away wont magically make my sleep problems disappear sadly.

1qd5wps,My friends mom ruined everything,Other,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"me and my friend Xavier in freshman year would skateboard a lot, and eventually we were curious about taking weed, so one day while skateboarding, he pulls out a Muha Gen 1, and he teaches me how to inhale (Xavier never told me he bought one before that day). After that day, we would get high and skateboard from time to time; it was peak life for us. But it would always just be me and him smoking because we knew our other friends who skateboard don’t want to be involved with marijuana.

Eventually we kind of got caught because our eyes were red and we were having a sleepover at his mom's house.(His mom is the strictest parent I know.) And after the sleepover, Xavier’s mom knew something was up, and so Xavier couldn’t skate, couldn’t bike, and couldn’t go anywhere in the town without his mom going with him. Mind you, Xaviers mom just thinks we’re doing weed; she never caught us, and because of her suspicion, which was right, he wasn’t allowed to hang with me and the people who skateboard with us and he can’t leave his house.

Xavier would tell me how she would throw some of his shirts away because she didn’t like what they represented.(He would save up to buy those shirts.) He never got his money for the shirts, so this just shows you what type of mom she is. I could keep going and talk about what she has done to Xavier, but it would be to long.

One day Xavier was tired of being trapped inside all day, and he saw his mom in the backyard, so he secretly left, and we both met, smoked and headed to the pool And while walking there, his mom is calling him, and he just doesn’t answer because he doesn’t care anymore. we go to my house real quick to go get some towels, and when we arrive there, we see his mom waiting in front of where I live, and she sees Xaiver, and we are both fried. She tells Xavier to go inside the car and We were both panicking,

Then Xavier’s mom came to me and said to not text Xavier because he wasn’t allowed to go outside and that now he’s in trouble.

(He didn’t get in trouble after that.)

It’s sophomore year, and he still can’t go outside, and ever since he was put in jail, my life started to become boring and depressing. But for Xavier, most of his teenage life is going to be him stuck in his house because of his mom. I don’t know why Xavier’s mom is like this, and she’s making him hate her for life over a stupid reason like weed. Xaiver has had good grades all his life, so it’s not like he was a bad kid with bad grades who smoked weed.

Eventually I stopped skateboarding because it got boring without him, and everyone else just stopped as well. I don’t hate Xaiver’s mom; she hasn’t done anything to me, but she doesn’t like me, and I understand as a parent you don’t want to see your child doing weed and want to do anything to prevent it, but she thinks I’m the problem, when in reality I’m not the problem; he’s the one who put me on marijuana.

1qcjzcy,I need advice,Advice,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"In november I liked this guy at my school and we started talking, then I realized I didn't like this guy and he was very much giving me the ick so I told him that I didn't like him and told him we could still be friends but then I realized I don't like him and I don't wanna talk to him or anything so I blocked him. But he keeps going to my church which makes me not wanna go. okay so fast foward to monday 1/12, omw to 4th hr after 3rd I saw him when I walked into the main school building, and i saw him and I booked it to class bc I didn't want anything to do with him and then I saw him look through the window of my class hallway. and then yesterday 1/13, I was omw to 4th hr after 3rd I walk in the doors to the building and I saw him (and I think he smiled) and for some reason this time I expected him to use the doors and leave so I don't book to class, omw to class I saw 2 of my friends so I went up to them to tell them what just happend but then I turn around and I see him walking in my direction and I freak out and go into my class hallway, i made my 2 friends come with me and then im talking about it and im crying, and then friend #3 comes to class and I was telling her and she said that she saw him on her way to class and he looked kinda upset and then friend #4 came to class and said he also saw him. But Idk what he wants because what he's doing is not an accident or coincidence. Even when we were talking we didn't cross paths omw to 4th hr so he litterally like never went that way and he's js waiting by the door, not going out them and then when I get in there he starts waking the same way as me. It makes me uncomfortable and litterally everything about him make me uncomfortable, I don't want anything to do with him at all, I don't wanna see him, I don't wanna talk to him, I don't wanna think about him. And I told my mom all of this and I was literally bawling my eyes out and she thinks I'm a terrible person, she said I should js say hi to him but im not about to do that, it'd make things worse and once anything I don't wanna talk to him. And she thinks I'm a terrible person bc I don't wanna go to church because of him. And that maybe he was meant to be in our church and wtv. But I can't tell her all the reasons I don't like him bc idk how she'll react. But the other day I was talking to my sister about it and so now she understands where I'm coming from and it felt good to be able to talk about with someone, it made me feel lighter. So basically now one of my friends said she'll come wait by the door so that she can walk with me to class and so hopefully hr doesn't approach me.

 But if anyone else has advice on what to do I'd appreciate it. Also please excuse my bad spelling i'm high. And if anyone wants to know why I don't like him I'll lyk.  "
1qd6tip,I hate my parents expectations,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I am at the top of my class, the programming lead of robotics, a black belt in TKD, a Boy Scout, and a decent saxophonist. My parents can't understand that I don't always need to be working towards my goals.

Today is the one day when I only have 1 EC after school, it's usually my day for me to relax and get a lot of my homework done. My dad (who, keep in mind, was ""working"" from home all day) immediately starts riding on me about robotics. We talked about it for 30 minutes. Then I went on my computer for 2 hours (the only time I talked to my girlfriend all day, cuz she was sick). A lady from robotics emails me saying she wants XXX done, won't take over 30 minutes.

My dad and I got into a massive argument because, according to him, I am lazy and have an addiction to YouTube. (all because I refused to do the robotics email the miliseccond the lady sent it). He starts saying I have no drive, no passion, nothing. I try to talk reason into him but he refuses to listen. We just kept arguing for probably a solid 30 minutes (when I could have just done the robotics thing). 

I won't get into why robotics is a mess, but we just keep arguing about how I should have fixed it, and how it's my fault the robot isnt working. (I asked to be a team lead, and the robotics people refused; I only control programming)

I ended up doing the robotics thing, while and a bit after we were arguing. My mom was not really supporting my dad and was spouting on about how sometimes you just need to ""lock in"".

After things had cooled down a bit, I tried to tell my dad that maybe if he just stopped arguing i could have done it faster. But according to him, he needs to yell and argue for me to do anything. He also said, ""I'm not taking any advice from a 15-year-old"", so I just gave up and started typing this post.

I know I'm in a really, really good position compared to some people. Millions, if not billions of people, have to deal with harder things every day, but all this just really aggravated me. From my own parents, too. My mom and dad always said that they ""will back me up"" and ""will always support me"", but currently it doesn't seem too true.

Mostly a rant, I don't expect anyone to read this. Just in a bad mood rn and needed to let some steam off."
1qcgsm2,I need some help,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I've lost all of my best friends forever but i can't move on and i always think about them and dream about a better future, which i ruined myself.

I've been keeping silent for a long time, but i think i need to talk it out // also English is not my native language, sorry

these people made me who i am and changed me much more than my friends, but they don't need me anymore. Maybe anyone can suggest what to do in this situation..? (that's why i'm here ye)

so the 1st one is my friend from my really early childhood, mb from my 2nd grade or something. We were the best friends (we called it more than a friendship but yk we were kids), and everything was fine, but after a few years we began to talk much less often and became ordinary friends. But we still talked.

But then the main thing happened. February 24, 2022. she moved from the country, while i stayed. after that we talked, really rarely, but we talked.

When she left, i was a really good person, didn't smoke, wasn't any 'phobic person yk, until i found 1 guy, who had... a bit bad behavior. so ye I've changed to the worse side, and she saw everything. every bad message i wrote, every stupid opinion, any word i'm ashamed of.

then she came back for \~a week ig and saw me this bad. at that time i was terrible. the first day we met was really good, the second one was terrible. we didn't say a word to each other. not a single one. from that time she has been ignoring me for the past 5 or 6 months

(i think it looks so funny from the outside, how this dumb guy writes such a mentally complex textwall while listening to ultrakill osts xdd)

2nd guy is also my old friend, not like the first, but we were friends from y2022. i rlly liked him, his behavior, tastes in everything, his knowledge in different complex sciences while he was younger than me.

we played lots of games, talked for more than 6 hours in voice everyday, and everything was fine, until i found another cool guy and started spending more time with him.

so my best friend started thinking that i had found a replacement for him and began to slowly stop our communicating and friendship. i thought he's just burned out and is tired from our friendship, and i also slowly forgot him. not rlly forgot, i was thinking rarely about him, but i thought that it was he who didn't want to communicate, and not that I had ruined everything again.

after a few years, on July 31 i wrote a small message that i'm really sad that he stopped our friendship so quickly, and that i was glad for these 3 years of friendship etc. And he suggested to be friends again. firstly i was very happy abt it, but now i understand that it was a mistake. or maybe not.

he somehow opened my eyes on myself. i realized that i don't have any favourite games, except some crappy ones like gd and cs, that i live without any purpose and any future. and i instantly wanted to change for the better (and i'm already trying)

but i also noticed that he wasn't interested in communicating as much as me. he didn't have any questions about these 3 years of my life, about me, he never wanted to go to voice, i always called him, and in the voice we were silent for a while cuz we couldn't figure out what to say to each other.

firstly i thought that the problem is in me, that i'm boring. but then there was a situation, so i can say that he just has a person who replaced his best friend, and he doesn't need me.

and now when we leave the voice, i always think that in this moment he chooses him over me. also it kinda hurts to suggest playing a co-op game and then see a message ""can 3 people play it?""

ehh i feel terrible"

Feelings


Her hair is like the void

Her Spirit as pure as the sun

You will always see her joyed

She makes his heart run


Her eyes, two desert jewels

She's always modest

They call him a fool

At least he's being honest


Feelings break friendships

People say things they don't mean

A girl that continuously worships

And a boy that sinned on routine


They stay friends

He keeps second guessing

Feelings start to blend

His feelings he kept repressing"
1qcb6sw,What’s the best way to break two people up?,Discussion,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"Now I know this sounds bad but hear me out here. 

I have a good friend, let’s just call him R. For a while, he was single, but he got a girlfriend about a month and half ago. Let’s call her T. All three of us are 14 and in 9th grade. Remember that. 

T asked R to be her girlfriend, and after about two weeks, they were texting each other things like “Love you Baby” and L was calling R her little twink and talking about pegging him and wanting to marry him (Three weeks in). 

He was not comfortable with this (or so he says) and when he asked her to stop she said she was joking. 

He keeps “flexing” to me that he got “earmuffs” from her when he went to her house. And he calls her Mommy apparently. 

He can’t go more than an hour without texting her. 

At this point it feels like a start to a horror movie where it is gonna devolve into stalking or R dead in T’s basement, and he ain’t listening to me when I tell him it isn’t the healthiest relationship. 

So genuinely what am I supposed to do here to help him out? "
1qc8ia7,Seeking advices/ opinions,Relationship,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"There's that guy I know for 2 years, we talked only a bit at first then we talk more and more even though I changed school he would actively message me and we often hang out. 

Recently he asked me out. It's the first time I meet someone who match my mentality so I accepted. 

He's perfect but I noticed some problems... My family is rather rich... He is rather poor due to some family issues... I think that personality is more important than the appearance since you can't change it buuut, he's not ugly but not handsome neither, his mom is a bit neglectful if you ask me; she doesn't buy him a razor, clothes that's his size etc... He looks kind of terrible but I can tell he's making efforts and has a big potential. I often vent to him, he's a great listener.

He always told me he only wanted one woman in his life because he can't stand the idea of having a ex. I suppose I should feel honoured... We're only 16, he keeps talking about the futur, we ended up talking about having kids, I never wanted kids because I just know I wouldn't make a great mother also my genes are really shitty, I have ADHD, Tourette's syndrome, CAPD and maybe more. He said he wanted kids and tried to convince me to want too but nah. 
I plan to go study med in the capital of the country so I'll be gone for a long time. He said he doesn't want to have long studies and want a physical demanding job. Let just say this is not very interesting to me.

Bad things : He's too shy and show no interest in school and is financially not that good. meanwhile I'm one of the top student of my school and I'm well-off

It's been 1 month and I smell breakup already. I'd feel so bad, I already feel bad but I think he deserves better than me and we are just not meant for eachother.

1qc1t9v,Some parents fr dont self-reflect,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"My sister (20) was working at this metal company yk writing receipts and whatever. She came home and ALWAYS had a negative storytime about her boss. He was arrogant, demanded work that wasnt even a part of your job and bro had literal anger issues. Now she changed her job and went to some hotel because she is a big fan of that work-branche and genuinely likes being a receptionist. My parents didnt like that and went on a full on argument about how shes making a big mistake, that the work times are not good, that the work will make her burn out and whatnot. 

HOWEVER it is my parents who said they dont really care about what we do as long as we're happy. But now that my sister likes doing something that they coincidentally dont like, she's getting berated and talked down to. My parents also complained that we never tell them anything and i fr wonder how they dont see it. Like i ask myself how they cant possibly muster up an answer as to why me and my sister keep some things secret from them.


This woman (my sister) just now decided she wont go to that hotel anymore because our parents said she was 'making the biggest mistake of her life'. And she wont even let me say anything to them, you know to defend her, because ""whats that gonna do?"". At this point im questioning confronting my parents about this because im going insane in this house and being the sensitive little b\*tch that i am, i cannot handle the constant negative criticism.

For context I(17F) have a really close friend(15F) and we’re both dating 2 best friends(both 16 M). Me and my boyfriend are on the more laid back side, very inclusive, but my friend and her boyfriend are very self centered with each-other. They constantly cancel plans with everyone to hangout alone, lie about curfews so we don’t go with them, make plans with everyone then make their own plans together without telling us they aren’t coming. This is mostly a me and my friend issue rather than the boyfriends. I have no privacy with her, every phone call has him in it, every hangout he’s there or he comes later on, everytime we’re together she barely talks to me because she’s more busy texting him, everything I say to her goes straight to him. I’ve already expressed my feelings once, she promised a change, I didn’t get it. Yesterday her boyfriend’s car broke down, and who went to save them? me. I never got a thank you, from either of them. She has barely made any effort to see me UNTIL his car broke down yesterday, now she’s texting me asking to make plans, I feel like it’s because she can’t see him now. So is this friendship even worth saving anymore? My mom and boyfriend say it’s best to let her go, but I need more opinions."

To her it’s: He’s here for a while, and its nice -&gt; then he’s gone the next day and doesn’t say a word for 2 days straight. 

I probably set a horrible standard in her head that I don’t want her or something and it eats me up at night.

1qb7q5w,16M | 16F :- she interested in me or is this just her caring nature? Also—when do I make my first move?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I’m a student, and I’ve recently gotten closer to a girl in my friend circle (let’s call her Laxmi). She went through a breakup not too long ago. From what she’s told me, she’s already moved on emotionally from her first relationship, but this recent one is still relatively fresh.
What’s confusing me is how suddenly she started caring more about me.

She checks in, asks how I’m doing, remembers small details, and genuinely seems concerned—like when I told her about my tennis elbow, she kept telling me not to go to the gym and to take care of myself. It didn’t feel forced or fake, just… attentive.

At the same time, she’s been very clear about one thing:
she prefers guy friends over girl friends. She’s said girls can be mean, talk behind backs, and don’t keep things private, while guy friends treat her better and are easier to talk to. Because of that, I know she’s naturally comfortable with guys.
That’s where I’m stuck.

I can’t tell if:
this care and attention is just her personality, or
if she actually sees me as something more
Recently, I asked her if she wanted to go to an art store with me. She initially said yes, then hesitated because it was far and she didn’t have money. I offered to pay—she was uncomfortable at first but eventually agreed, saying she’d need to check with her mom and that exams are going on, so it wouldn’t be this week.

This is also important:

this would be my first time traveling alone with a girl, and I don’t want things to get awkward or weird. I’m not trying to rush anything or treat this like some strategy game—I just don’t want to misread signals or mess things up by moving too fast or too slow.

What I actually need advice on (main questions):

How do you tell if a girl like this is genuinely interested or just naturally caring with guy friends?

When is the right time to make a first move, especially considering she just had a breakup?

How do I handle awkwardness while traveling together so it feels comfortable and natural, not forced?"

The problem is, she despises of many ppl (boys mostly) infront of me. Cuz many of em keep ""shooting their shots"" (i respect that... like  A LOT).

I have one 'talking stage' from Canada and like he makes me feel all nice and precious but we always said sum like if we find someone irl we will tell each other immediately but we shouldn't feel guilty when we talk to someone because irl is more important and he already rejected one girl because of me (got the screenshots for that) so I'll reject that guy too duh, but I won't be a mean bitch (don't get me wrong he seemed nice) but in general not my type and it would be too risky

I think he still wants me and he's messaging me more than he used to, but he fucking friendzoned me so I'm ignoring him like I do with friends. He can't just do that and act like we're closerrrr than ever.  
Anyways the breakup was yesterday and tbh I used to be afraid of guys my age because I was groomed by a 15yr when I was 12 and got touched more than I should have. 💀

Thing is, lately I've had my eye on a guy from church and just brushed it off as being weirded out by his advances towards me, but I usually don't get like that to where I continue talking to someone. Last night he wanted to call and so I did, but I ended up cuddling with my pillow and almost falling asleep. It was really weird, I was screensharing YouTube videos and he kept asking if I was okay because I looked depressed but really I was trying to hide my facial expression because I remembered a dream I had about him last week which I tried to forget about.  
After he hung up I wasn't sleepy anymore and couldn't sleep because my face was red. I don't even know why I feel comfortable around him, in fact, I feel incredibly guilty and embarrassed.   
And about a month ago I kept glancing at him from across the room at youth group so I think I might've even been in denial for a while now and this feeling's getting worse.

You may think that's a good thing.... But it's not. For the full picture, I dress like a dude, have short red hair, and talk about the woman I'm with quite frequently. So, idk why he does this but okay. I moved 7 times to get away from him yesterday and he kept following me, idk how much more clear I could've been. I sat next to my friend who got up and he took her seat so I scooted away. Then he stood less than a foot away from me so I scooted to the side about another foot and HE GOT EVEN CLOSER. I LITERALLY PICKED UP MY CHAIR AND WALKED TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM BEFORE HE STOPPED AND JUST STARED AT ME THE WHOLE CLASS. That wasn't the whole class of me moving, I kept moving but that was the only time he made it super obvious.

I DONT EVEN TALK OR INTERACT WITH THIS KID EITHER BRO. I've walked away while he was mid talking, said ""NUH UH"" and moved my chair TWICE when he sat next to me in the past, I've voted against him in everything so life is harder, I've even straight up said that I didn't want to talk to him. I don't like bullying people, but if he would just leave me alone then I'd just ignore him. I don't talk much, I keep my head in my books and eyes on my drone. HE WONT STOP. So how do I get this incell to screw off and leave me alone?"

I don’t know I just feel so guilty, also I’m a little scared because he kept trying to change my mind after, so I blocked him, but now he texted my cousin telling her to make me change my mind. I just regret this so much, I wish I had more self control back then fuck"

However, I always feel disgustingly fat when I look at myself. I have a good waist, but my stomach pudges out and even bloats after a simple breakfast.

No matter how much I eat, I always find myself feeling guilty that I ate it at all, especially since I don’t even work out to get it off. I kind of feel pathetic because of it. 

I’m not trying to starve myself, and I am not not eating. I just want to feel like I look good.

I did get a membership to my local YMCA, and I am hoping that could motivate me to work out. My boyfriend is super sweet and even encourages me to go snack throughout the day, which helps a little, but I still feel gross.

Two weeks ago I started seeing us better as friends so I told her that today and then I was flirting with another girl (after the breakup) and now she’s my valentine but she talked to my ex and yeah I don’t know if what I’ve done is bad because I am the one who convinced my ex to be my gf and she was guilty bc of religion but I loved her more than a friend I really did I just want to know if what I did is bad or not."
1qzpkga,I think my mom hates my sister and I dont know what to do,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"every time my sister  says something to my mom it usually turns into a screaming match initiated by my mom. they end up arguing for like 30 minutes, and my mom ends up insulting her a bunch for seemingly no reason. 

for example, today my sister told my mom that she doesn't feel good. then, my mom said its because she doesn't eat, without questioning her about what doesn't feel good or showing any care about her. then, my sister started saying she does eat (which she does. maybe not the most healthy, but that's because she's a picky eater and my mom acts like its the worst thing in the world if she has to cook something different to accommodate her). this started a huge argument where, as usual, my mom starts screaming at her and insulting her. its just really upsetting overhearing this from wherever I am from my room.

then, after this she starts acting like she's the victim and saying she's ""tired of being attacked all the time"" (she usually starts it) and then she usually leaves the house for a bit to do god knows what. then, she usually takes her phone and usually some of her other belongings as if that helps. after that, she may feel guilty and come back into my sister's room to apologize about yelling at her, or she might have thought of new material to scream at her about and then do that instead. oh yeah, you wanna know the best part? SHES 12!!!! SHES DOING ALL THIS TO A 12 YEAR OLD!!!!!!

the thing is, whenever I try to talk to my mom about the fact that maybe she needs to treat my sister a bit nicer she starts yelling at ME and saying how ""everyone just loves to argue with me,everyone hates me!!!!!"" I just feel so powerless, im witnessing my sister be basically traumatized for life in front of me and I cant do anything."
1quwe4x,Is this really love?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I’m looking for genuine advice from people who’ve experienced something similar.

I (F18) met someone (M18) and we became very close very quickly. We talked every day for hours, clicked instantly, shared the same interests, humor, and communication style. At first, he clearly said he was romantically unavailable and only wanted friendship.

About two weeks in, he suddenly confessed that he loved me. I was skeptical and initially rejected him, which he accepted,but he kept saying he loved me. Over time, I developed feelings too, and things became confusing.

One moment he was incredibly affectionate, telling me he wanted a future with me, reassuring me constantly, being emotionally open and reliable. Other times, he became distant, cold, or pushed me away. He said he was dealing with an inner conflict and often felt guilty for expressing emotions.

He shared his traumatic childhood (abusive parents), which I relate to. There was a strong emotional bond, but also a push–pull dynamic.

A few weeks ago, I was in a very vulnerable state because one of my abusive parents re-entered my life. I was crying and panicking and told him how much everything hurt — including the inconsistency between us. I wasn’t angry; I just needed emotional presence.

He responded by spiraling into self-hatred, saying he couldn’t help me, mentioning distance and “maybe in the future.” When I asked him to just be there with me in that moment, he blocked me everywhere without goodbye or explanation.

From the beginning, I only asked one thing: if he ever wanted to leave, please tell me and give me a reason. Because of my past, abandonment is a big trigger for me. He promised many times he would never leave.

That’s why this hurts so deeply. I believe he genuinely loved me, we talked for hours, sent long voice messages, stayed up across time zones, and supported each other consistently.

I’m struggling to understand:

Why would someone leave like this if they love you? And is there a chance I will ever be able to speak to him again?"

1quao9h,My Dad Keeps Begging Me To Be Straight,Advice,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"I(16F) have gotten to a point of my life where my dad(48M) starts to worry about me going out with boys and who i hang or dont hangout with, ive always shown a certain tendency for girls, a few years ago i was going through a lot of discovery since, well, hormones were at their peak and I was curious as to what i really liked, went through a lot of labels, and yet to this day, im still not sure what i truly like because ive never felt truly ""in love"", its a complicated topic, what i mean by this is, my dad knows I may have a tendency to play for the other team or however they say it, so now he keeps telling me randomly ""please dont turn lesbian, im begging you at least get a nice husband"" or ""you can play around a bit but please dont bring a girl home""

It bothers me alot, and hes done this time and time again at family gatherings, implying I like girls and that I shouldnt, when I myself dont know, the last time this happened was a week or so ago, we were at a family party, he got drunk, he pulled me to a corner and straight up hugged me, telling me he was just concerned, that he really wanted me to get a good man.. it was really awkward, and as ashamed as i am to admit, it got me feeling guilty, he has his believes and I know hes not used to these things, I dont think i would mind dating a guy but at the same time it feels wrong to not even let myself think that theres other possibilities, its a bittersweet feeling

I also think hes been saying this because of my Best friend, I get along with all kinds of people but my best friend is a trans man, has short dyed hair, cross earing and baggy clothes, so to my parents, who know him since childhood just like me, hes a masculine girl, not only that.. my dad thinks hes a lesbian.. and even worse he thinks I and my friend might be going out (which, first up, my friend doesnt even like women, two, we are NOT infact going out, I dont even know where that came from, Three, He doesnt mind when its me getting piercings and dying my hair wich is kinda weird)

I was never into relationships, just never got into it though a little desire might be there, but now its even worse, even IF i do fall for someone, if I date a guy ill be complying and he will think he cured me from lesbianism and If I date a girl he will think he lost his little girl

  
Its just been bothering me and I dont know if i should do something about it"
1qr7939,"I feel insecure and confused in this friendship, and someone help me.",Relationship,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I have been friends with this girl for around 4 years now. She is a social bird, gorgeous, giggly, and magnetic (like, everyone wants to be friends with her). I, maybe awkward and annoying, was the shy and aggressively stupid kid. Talked to her, fought with her sometimes, snitched on her a few times when I thought her gossip was rude, shared each other's feelings, gossiped for fun, and all the damn stuff. I don't wanna boast, but I was a notch higher than her in studies. I assumed she got scared when I was angry.

There were clashes; girls wanted to be her sidekicks, guys wanted to be her man. Ugh. Too much drama. She had family problems. A guy used to stalk her, and her so-called 'best cousin' scared him off. The best cousin had a boyfriend, blah blah, she told me stories, I didn't want to believe, but I couldn't say that in her face. The apparent stalker was the class's jock. They lived nearby. She used to rant about that to me, her other friend, and some guy, with her best cousin. I used to feel sorry for her. The thing is, I once caught her winking at him, and the jock was grinning like an idiot. My gut told me so. She forced me to talk to him, and I did, asking for some advice on how to confess to my crush. He gave something stupid. She forced me to prank him by sending messages from a fake account as his ex-girlfriend, and I did. I blocked him when he said he wanted me back (like he didn't know I was not the ex he was 'begging' for). As I connect the dots, the pranks and the stalker stories feel scripted.

She ranted to me a lot, and I listened too, as a good friend would. She told me something about chatting with a new guy, and he proposed. She begged for advice. I just said block him. She insisted I talk to him, and I said no, my dad would blast my ass if he found out. I saw her lips twitch upwards. I knew she was lying, but I wasn't sure. Fuck the trust-issues. She pranked me by sending some su1c1d1al messages and ghosted me for 5 hours. I panicked and called her parents and relatives, but no one lifted. She called me, and I lifted. She yelled PRANKKKK, and frankly, I felt like an idiot.

She puts a lot of effort into showing her love, though. Like supporting me when I'm down, listening to me talk, giving me and sharing with me food, being honest and respectful. She gave me reality checks and actually trusted me sometimes. I love it too, and I feel guilty for making this friendship look one-sided. I can't express love easily. But I don't know what the truth is and what's a lie. How do you feel?

1qu89xp,Why do I feel this way? (sorry for my bad english😓),Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"so this is my first time posting here on reddit but i cant help but feeling guilty about blocking a pedo that texted me(14F). I feel like someone would understand me. 



About an hour ago, an account from my country texted me on reddit, asking some stuff about my sexuality. I didn't mind it at the first place, I answered his questions but he was making it pretty obvious that he checked out my bio by telling a few things like my gender and sexuality and all that stuff. Well, thats where the problem starts cuz I wrote ""taken"" on my bio so am I but he started to talk flirty with me. I implied that I can just be his friend, nothing more but he kept talking. I didnt ask his age, cuz since he knew about my age and talked flirty with me so I thought we were peers. We talked about friendships and I said I dont really have friends irl so i am open to online friendships and I wouldnt really mind a small age difference, thats when he revealed his age to me: 25... 

I kept talking with him but I called him bro dude etc and said i see him as a friend over and over again (we were only talking for barely 40 minutes btw) I even called him ""abi"" which is a word that we use for older brothers. But he called me honey...

And by the way, somewhere in the chats, he said im ""too mature for my age"" and that ""could become a problem for him"", not that I am 11 years younger than him, but that I am too mature and he could be attracted to me. He even said that he doesnt want to get arrested or judged because of me.

Before this paragraph starts, I know that I was a dumbass but I cant help it: I told him age doesnt really matter since I have online friends from 8 to 19 and I would quickly get used to 25 too...(ik😓)

I started not to feel so safe after all this stuff and I shutted him up after he called me honey. Then, I texted him again, but I told him I cant text him anymore cuz my gf was mad at me and disturbed at the way he talked with me. I told him we fought bc of the chats with him and she even slapped me (we are long distance i just blamed her for ts😭). He said ""its okay, im fine with it as long as youre happy, im here whenever you want"" Great, right? nope...

  
After 5, he texted me if my gf was next to me and i said yes ,even tho she is not, he said ""then text me when you get home, we can talk"" I asked him if hes asking for me to disregard my gf and he said ""we will talk about it"" I texted him a whole paragraph about how ""as long as you are happy"" and ""text me when you are alone"" arent the same thing and he was crossing the limits. Then I finally blocked him.

But I lowk feel bad since I told him that we could be friends and we could get along like i tricked him, and I dont even know him that much yk, hes not that type of a guy i assume but he might be a dangerous guy too. I dont know what to do or say and even feel...

I know that I am not but I still feel bad, AITAH?"
1qrfoxv,was I groomed? what’s the overall opinion,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"When I was 11, I became friends with a 20-21 year old on TikTok. If I remember correctly, she used to vent to me a lot about her bad childhood trauma and she talked about her life issues with me like how she can’t get guys. When I tried to comfort her during her times of sadness, she would always be like “everyone leaves me” and when I said I wouldn’t, she said “I dont believe you” “I’ll always think people are lying when they tell me that” “You can say that all you want but I’ll never trust anyone ever again it’s all fake” she always wanted me to stay with her I was so scared of leaving her because of this and her always venting to me about her daddy issues and abandonment issues. But idk she was still really kind to me so I question myself for leaving her and never talking to her again. I remember feeling so guilty when I couldn’t find her account she told me I was mature for my age and that made me feel really special "
1qqur4b,AITA for wanting my dad to have custody of me?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So for context, my parents split when I was 6 and they have a very...interesting custody arrangement. It's sort of a 'My dad gets me a couple times this year while my mom gets me a couple times this year' sort of thing if that makes sense. But last year, my mom and I moved in with my step-dad. IN SPAIN. I was only supposed to be there for 4-5 months but because of immigration stuff I ended up being there an extra one. So of course, my dad was unhappy because I missed a few weeks where I was supposed to be with him. I'm tired as fu- Anyways, they went to court, blah blah blah, and I'm with my dad for a month to make up for that extra one. 



Now for the ​other stuff. I don't know specifically why my brain just likes it here more, but it does. I feel less stress, I don't feel insecure about singing (I don't with my mom either, but it's more comfortable here, Idk), and I feel more open to talk about more stuff. 

I think I have emotional problems with my mom because with her, I feel unloved when I know she loves and cares for me, I'm not as open to talking about my feelings with her, and my subconscious mind doesn't like her as much. I don't know why because I love them both very, VERY much!! But when I'm with my dad and stepmom, ​I feel more comfortable and just have more fun. I don't know why and I'm freaking out because I feel very guilty thinking about wanting custody of my dad more than my mom. Does anyone have advice?"

I cut my ex cut it off not in a nice way and was pretty quick with it. Then not very much a week after i started talking to multiple girls and now my current girlfriend, i think i did most of it to cope, which it seemed worked. But now i just cant get her off my mind, like i have this playlist i made for my ex and every time we are driving in my car i put it on for my girlfriend, she loves the music, but its one thing i feel so guilty about, i try to have it so when i think of it i think of her, but nothing. Ive talked to friends on what to do, i’ve detoxed my self by forcing myself away from everything that could remind me, i just haven’t found anything to help and nothing every seems to help me get over her.

1qosx1p,AITA for feeling jealous about sharing my Steam library with my little brother?,Discussion,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"i want to start off by saying that, i know that there a subreddit for this specifically, but I wanted other teens opinions specifically.

I have a Steam account that I’ve been “growing” for years, and I’ve spent around 1k dollars total on games. Recently my little brother got his first PC, and we set up Steam Family Sharing so he can access my entire library for free.

On paper, this sounds totally fine. I’m not losing access to my games, and I didn’t buy them with the expectation of getting something back. But emotionally, I’ve been feeling weirdly jealous about it. I worked, saved, and spent my own money on these games, and now he just gets all of them instantly without spending anything. Meanwhile, I don’t really get anything in return. (Not that I expected anything)

I feel guilty about feeling this way because he’s my brother and I love him, so I talked to my mom about it. From that conversation, I got the impression that she might think I’m being selfish. That made me feel even worse, like maybe I’m just being immature or entitled.

I haven’t taken away his access or said anything mean to him. I’m just sitting with these feelings and trying to figure out if they’re unreasonable.

So AITA for feeling jealous about sharing my Steam library with my little brother?"

1qo6xeu,I’m not my best friend’s best friend and I don’t know what to do,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"(This is my first post here, I’m really sorry if I’m breaking any rules!!)

The title is pretty much self explanatory.

I’ve always really struggled to get along with people because of my crippling social anxiety, and the few “friendships“ that I managed to score were pretty toxic and dependent on the fact that I was too much of a doormat to say no to anything they wanted to do. Up until summer of 2025, I hadn’t had any real, nontoxic friendships for eight years. So, in 2025 when I went to a short, week-long summer camp, I forced myself to decide I was gonna be super social and make at least one friend. And I did, which was super awesome!!! She’s really sweet and mature and funny, and we share a lot of interests and ideologies.

We kept in contact after camp, and it’s genuinely such an incredible experience to experience my first friendship that doesn’t drain me!!! Naturally, being my only friend, she’s my best friend. However, she’s made it very abundantly, accidentally clear that I’m not hers, not out of malice or anything! We’re extremely close, and she’s said so herself multiple times that I’m one of her closest friends.

However, recently she’s had some issues with her best friend, which I’ve been helping her with by taking a neutral stance and helping her figure out how to fix things between them, and I’m incredibly happy at the prospect that they’re going to be best friends again and that they’ll both be happy, but I realized at the end of my conversation with her that I felt incredibly lonely.

It’s not her fault in the slightest, she’s gone out of her way to show me how much she appreciates me, but I genuinely wish that I was someone’s favorite person. As stereotypical as it is, a tiny, messed up part of me liked the prospect of my friend and her best friend falling out and me becoming her new best friend, and I hate it so much and would never seriously wish that on her.

I feel selfish and guilty and really confused, I don’t know how to stop feeling so lonely while having such a wonderful friend at the same time. Should I just try and make myself be grateful that I have a wonderful friend at all, or is it okay to feel bad at the fact I’m not anyone’s go-to friend??

I‘m really sorry for this, I don’t want to make this a pity party about me but I really want advice, please

(edit: I don’t know if this affects anything but I might be autistic and have an extremely difficult time making friends online, and i cant make friends in person either because I live in the middle of nowhere (the population is 50 and the nearest town is an hour away) and am homeschooled. Not to mention, people are often put off my lack of social skills to the point where most people who I would’ve liked to befriend thought of me as too weird and didn’t bother trying.)"

I am still pretty messed up from a last relationship that was really bad, and I just didn't like the feeling of being tied down. I was already getting. When I talked with her, I told her that at this time in my life, headed towards college, I just didn't want a relationship, regardless of who it was, because I wanted to focus on my interests without being tied down, and that I just preferred having her as a friend. After we broke up, it has been fine, and we've talked a little with no hard feelings. Recently, I started messaging with a boy I used to have a crush on.

The problem is, since we met about 3-4 months ago, he doesn't do anything. He's not studying, dropped his work, so he basically stays at home all the time and plays games. I tried to talk him to do something, but it's gone to a state where he goes to sleep at 7am and wakes up at 5pm. And after waking up, maybe he texts me first everyday, but goes straight to gaming and literally does not text me first in most cases. I feel like when I'm talking about important stuff with him he just nods, he doesn't engage in the conversation. I'm usually the one planning our meetings.
One situation, we agreed that he will pick me up from school at 11am, he overslept, didn't answer my calls, and finally went online at 2pm, and texted me he'll be there in an hour after I saw him online and asked if he'll be coming. Didn't apologize afterwards, and even tried to blame it on me by saying if he was to wake up later he wouldn't oversleep. Apologize only after I teared up and told him this situation hurt me.
Second situation: We got freaky at his place, and he went to clean himself up and I stayed in his room, door somewhat was open and his mom almost came in where I was half naked, after he came back he said he closed the door and I'm guilty for letting it open, and I shouldn't be embarrassed bc his mom knowa that he does it. I mean okay but it was embarrassing for me?
And now a situation that made me write this, I'm sick. I've been staying at home alona for a week, and asked him to talk. After 2 hours of playing with his friends he answered that he doesn't feel like it. That's it. It hurt as hell.
I love him, I love his humor and how gentle he is. But this relationship is ruining me. I don't know if I can stay in it, but on the other hand I love him too much. I'm not sure what to do, for now I decided to not text him anything and see what he does.
Also, I'm an anxious type, but I'm working on it. I stated facts only here. Honestly, i don't know what to do. I tried talking a few times but well it looked like talking to a wall. Anyone has amy ideas what to do? We have a meeting scheduled this Sunday."

1qo5h70,Battling List (17 M),Serious,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"So I’ve been battling my Lust a lot and especially my urges of wanting a girlfriend.

I’ve not had a lot of girlfriends and am still a virgin but I will say it’s getting really difficult. I have such a high drive and on top of it I kinda wonder if I have a less severe form of hyper sexuality though that’s unsure.

I could have a Gf right now but I told her that I can’t because while I do want her really bad, the problem is I don’t think I can lover her the way I’d want to or even for the right reasons.

Additionally I’m Christian and I do have shame/ stuff I’m not proud of. And idk if I’d say I’m necessarily waiting for marriage but I am waiting until the time feels right. And when I was littler my dad also gave me 5 pillars and requirements that me and a girlfriend would have to agree on before getting serious as they tend to be Bing things that can make or break a relationship including Religion, Kids, Money habits, Future plans/Goals, and Politics.

Another problem is that I kinda wanna be sexualized but I feel guilty about it if I try anything and I truly think that what I most desire right now is a really sexual relationship but one that honors God and I’m not sure if I can get that right now.

Really I just wanna know how do yall get over the Lust? I don’t wanna date just to date and I wanna be secure in how I feel I think. But I gotta say I’m getting driven up the walls with how im feeling."

1qny29j,Am I in the wrong?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Am I the asshole?

My name shall not be mentioned nor is anyone else involved but shall go by fake names. There was a guy at my school Jake who had already dated a girl before that school year and had gotten onto me. We were mutual in our interest. I said things I regret such as being flirty to only soon realize after that i was uncomfortable with how physical the guy, let’s call him Jake, made me feel. He had once said that he wanted to see me in a thong(we’re both minors) to which that night i sent him a picture of me in a thong. I regretted and still do regret that choice deeply. I soon stated to get distant from him due to his increasingly uncomfortable approach to me and what he had said to other people. He had even said he wanted to rape one of my other friends however soon after a big incident where he got with my best friend, who we will call holly, who had knew of what had been going on and him having a past of drugs to which had also made me uncomfortable. I had gotten some friends to go with me to confront them and I did. The next day they reported me and the others that were there. I tried to be civil and give holly the benefit of the doubt and not tell anyone what had happened so she would have friends that weren’t mine that she and Jake could hurt anymore. It was a whole situation that was stupid. However the situation just got worse and worse from there. Another girl who we will call Beth decided to tell me things. This was after an incident I didn’t actually understand but feel guilty for and knew I had done wrong and wanted to fix. I made people uncomfortable, and once said something I shouldn’t had. Two friends had just gotten together and I was happy for them. One of them named Zane told me she used to have a crush on me to which I responded with “oh yeah I used to have a crush on you as well” and laughed about it with them. I didn’t think it was much of an issue since we joked about it but it upset people and I knew I had done wrong even if there was justification for my actions. It was no excuse and hurt people regardless. I hope I can be forgiven and if not I understand due to the importance of overstepping a boundary and disrespecting their new relationship. However this is just tiny things. Last year, I did say that Beth, a new girl at my school would primly be the end of my ex friend group that I had been kicked out of. I didn’t entirely understand it then but soon realized the gravity of my mistakes. I realized how I had hurt people. I hoped to better respect boundaries and set goals for myself to make me a better person. Beth had talked intimately with many people that year and had been talked badly about by about everyone in that friendgroup due to this. Thats my justification and the reason I don’t feel bad for saying what I said to the friends I had left. I wasn’t the only one who thought that either so more fuel to the fire.  Not to mention i recently found out that Beth had went to my assaulter to ask about what happened between me and him. He, not wanting to cause a bad name for himself from what im assuming lied and said i was victimizing myself. She believed this and has held that against me. I have pictures of chats saying he was going to touch me. The mental struggles that make me terrified of male touch. And not to mention the case couldnt even be taken to court because he was the one explicitly asking for pictures and pressuring me however this was all overlooked by Beth. Very smart Beth. Sooooo smart 🙄. Beth called me munipulative and that i victimize myself. I’ve never thought of myself like that but respect other peoples opinions of me so I’ve tried to be less and less of that in the ways I could conclude. I don’t think that’s made any difference tho. Back to Jake. Recently, Jake and holly have became friends of the people they made uncomfortable, excluding me. I had little respect for either of them until a situation happened. One after another. I was constantly being told of things that were happening between holly and Jake. Especially Jake. The final straw that I lost all respect for him was when a girl liked me and did not want to come out when he and some people that I trusted deeply decided to try and discover this. Jake pushed the thought until the girl revealed who it was or at least hints that weren’t hard to conclude. He ended up spreading it across the school, completely disregarding the fact she didn’t want to come out as bi due to her parents being very Christian. This deeply hurt her and even tho we have been broke up it still upsets me since it showed his real personality. Upon being confronted by mutual friends he said “it’s whatever.” I lost all respect for him after that. He and holly can torment me all they like but I’m tired of my friends being involved because I’m terrified of losing the people I love and them being hurt. Especially my friend Carson. I care about him a lot. Hes been there for me for everything even when holly wasnt. I hold a very deep respect for him. I don’t know what I would do if something bad happened to him. Jake and him are friends from what I know and I’m really worried. In calls which was mine and Jake’s main communication system and where many disgusting things that he not just said about me and my body but also about my friends was stated. I don’t have proof to this. None. He spoke of how mine and hollys friend, Delilah, was unattractive, how he found Carson attractive and wanted to do things to him, and many other thoughts about other people. It made me uncomfortable but I decided to see through the end of the relationship and silently move on before holly whom I used to have a deep crush on decided to get with him. This isn’t even what makes me upset tho. The fact that my friends are moving on is what makes me upset. Beth invited me to the movies knowing the exact time holly and Jake were going. She said they were still trying to figure out the times so I knew she was lying when she said it was a coincidence just before. I felt like the odd one out in the friend group. I didn’t say anything tho of how I felt. Jake is constantly being mentioned one way or another and every time it hurts me knowing how he thinks from how he spoke in our calls. But I still have no proof and feel like I’m losing the energy to constantly be happy to maintain friends. There’s a lot more going on but these are the main things. I haven’t told any one of how this has made me feel and feel like I’m a terrible person for thinking this way. I feel terrible for the hate in my heart. I don’t know what to do. I wanna expose the wrongdoings of the people who are actively a threat to me and have made me feel less than deserving of love but I feel like I can’t do anything in this game of cat and mouse. I don’t wanna force my way of thinking on others but I’m genuinely worried about their safety being around these people. Not as must Beth even if shes toxic I think she has the ability to change but holly has shown she doesn’t care about others and just about her active relationship by not just this but by two prior relationships where she pushed away friends and family just for a guy, and Jake whos hurt people and gets forgiven just like that. I don’t know how much more hate I can take. So once again, am I the asshole?"
1qn51m2,Im unsure of what to do.,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I have been dating this girl I met for a couple months now, me, 16m, and after a bit she began to flirt with me very suggestively, like.. sexual flirting, and it wasn't until recently that she admitted she was 13, when we first met she told me she was 14 (3 years and a half younger compared to the just 2 years younger I originally thought.) Now I know that's just one year, and I do still care about her, but I want to know what limits I should hold considering the way she was flirting with me.

He asked me to play quite a few times but I always had something going on, maybe if I would have he could have opened up to me and I could have helped him. But again I only knew him for a month. I’ve been messaging him on Snapchat every day to see if he’s there but nothing. No new reposts on TikTok or snapscore increasing at all. I don’t know any of his family members or his friends irl so I can’t do shit, I know I didn’t know him for long but I just wonna make sure he’s okay.

1qna2k2,first time someone’s actually called me genuinely annoying,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I know it’s just one person, and I shouldn’t think too much of it—but i genuinely feel horrible about myself now. basically I was talking to this person for about a day, then they had to go, and I maybe texted like 2 or 3 times after they went.

  
when they came back, they chatted a little but dry, then just fully admitted they found me genuinely annoying, didn’t want to talk to me anymore, and didn’t really care in the way they worded it. I cried. I don’t know why but I cried. It really shouldn’t have affected me, but this is literally my worst nightmare come true that being myself is annoying and people don’t like it

i just need some advice on how I can feel a bit better. I did apologise, say my personality isn’t for everyone and told them to have a nice day, but they haven’t replied (expected, but still). I just still feel almost guilty for being annoying? I don’t know."

I broke up with her (I really liked her but was not attracted to have and had lost feelings) and it was mutual. It wasn’t until I watched (and I’m not joking about this) the scene in stranger things season 5 where will Byers comes out that i had a think about why i felt so guilty during my relationship, why i lost feelings, why the kiss felt wrong and it hit me like a ton of bricks. I am gay. And I kinda just needed to share this somewhere. I talked to her and we are cool with each other, she was a bit hurt at first but came around to the idea that I am gay.

1qlx4ko,I nearly lost my boyfriend in a motorbike accident,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"My life has been a mess the last few months. For context, I started a new school in September and struggled making friends. I became close to one girl who was kind of controversial because apparently she’d been involved in a lot of drama but I try not to judge. I was desperate for someone and she reminded me of another close friend I have so we started hanging out and she introduced me to my boyfriend.

We started talking in September and officially got together in October. I know that’s quite recent, but I tend to get attached to people pretty quick. I’ve been in situationships and talked to guys before, but it’s never gone anywhere. He’s the first guy I’ve felt actually cares about me, and I was so excited to see where our relationship would go.

Early December, he was in a serious accident and had to be put into a medically induced coma for a week. When he finally woke up, I was so relieved. He was really drugged up so his messages weren’t making sense, but just being able to talk to him made me so happy. A few weeks went by, he returned home from hospital, and we were still messaging a lot. I asked if I could come see him, but he doesn’t want any visitors yet which is understandable so i didn’t press him on it. Something was slightly off though, but I didn’t know what. I later found out through my friend (the one mentioned earlier) that he had told her he lost all memory of the months leading up to the crash, and didn’t remember who I was.

I went on for weeks not telling him, because I didn’t know how he’d react to me finding out. I guess I was also kind of hurt that he hadn’t told me, but again, I can understand being nervous about it. He’s been through a lot and I didn’t want to put him under any more stress. Eventually I asked his best friend if he knew about the memory issues, and he said that my bf hasn’t had any memory issues. I trust him, and also my friend has been known to exaggerate and stretch the truth so I wouldn’t be surprised if she wasn’t being completely honest or if she’d misinterpreted what he said.

Because I was getting frustrated with not knowing what’s happening, I gently asked my bf if he had any problems with his memory. He told me he didn’t. I’d like to believe he’s being honest, but he could be lying to protect my feelings. I really don’t know. This month he’s becoming more dry with his messages. I know he’s been depressed since the accident. He’s stuck at home constantly and really misses his bike, which is understandable. I’ve been trying my hardest to be there for him, asking him if he wants to talk abt anything and promising that I’ll stay with him through it all. He just doesn’t seem to care though.

Apparently he’s been opening up to my friend about how he’s been feeling since the accident, even though the two of them didn’t really get along before and he told me he didn’t like talking abt his feelings to anyone (me included I guess).

I asked his best friend if he’s ok, because he’s seemed upset and won’t talk to me about it, but his friend left me on opened, which I’m guessing isn’t a good sign. At this point, I don’t know what to do. I feel horrible writing this out. What happened was absolutely horrific and the way I’m feeling seems trivial in comparison, but I really feel stuck and I need to get it off my chest. My dad thinks I should break up with him, but I can’t do that to him after he’s been through something so traumatic. I just want to help him but I don’t think he wants my help. He doesn’t want anything from me.

We were so close before the accident, and I really miss what we had before. I feel like I’m talking to a different person now and I don’t know if it’s because of memory loss, depression or a personality change (he had brain bleeding so it’s possible).

I feel like if I bring this up to him it’ll just make things worse. I don’t want to make him feel guilty and he’ll probably just brush off whatever I say to him. I don’t know who to talk to because it’s such a weird situation I don’t know anyone else who has gone through it. People kind of assume that it hasn’t affected me that much because we hadn’t been together that long but I genuinely loved him and I still do. I feel like I’m the only person who knows that. Even he seems to have forgotten.

I know he wasn’t the love of my life, and our relationship wouldn’t have lasted forever, but I miss what we could’ve been. It all go cut off too short and the only person at fault here is the woman who hit him. I’ve never felt so much anger towards someone I don’t know. She’s affected so many lives from one stupid decision and she doesn’t even know it. I hate her and I hate this.

Edit: his friend literally just messaged me saying he doesn’t want to be with me anymore…"

1ql0up3,Advice and opinions,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"There was this guy we meet online because we had mutual friend between us.

Like the day I told everything and share my ID with him he saw that one person in mutual and he was like how do you know this guy I don't know if he was getting jealous of that person or he had some personal issues so I told him that we are friends etc okay and then when I question him about why he  followed me and removed me he said oh it's not that deep,why are you being so serious about this thing ok I tried asking him to 2,3 times but he never answered the reason so I left that topic and then we talk like for another 2,3 weeks. And now you are like very chill with each other ragebaiting, teasing, flirting.I don't know he has some kind of trauma I guess that he has his guards very up.

1ql3oh4,"I (17F) like someone I live with, but I have a boyfriend (18M) and now im really confused",Advice,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"This is very messy, so I’ll have to give some background. Basically i started a new school last September which is a boarding school with a lot of pupils, a lot of people from my grade and the grade above me added me on snap and insta, and some guys started snapping me which I didn’t think much of until around October. There was two guys that I snapped frequently, a guy from the grade above, who I’ll call Connor, and a guy from my grade, who I’ll call Sam. We had a retreat day in our school 2 weeks before halloween break, which is a day where we have no classes and play loads of games. Sam came up to me on retreat day and asked me did I want to sit down and talk, i had never talked to him before and thought why not! We got on really well and then a few days later we started texting, and all my friends would tell me how he is maybe the nicest guy in the whole school, and would treat me sooo well. Sam doesn’t board in the school as he lives close, whereas I do. (this is relevant later) About a week and a half after I started talking to Sam there was a halloween party for boarders only, and Connor was there. Connors friend came over to me and told me how Connor really liked me and thought i was super pretty, and Connor’s friend thought we should go for a walk together outside and maybe even make out! At first I couldn’t stop thinking of Sam, but then I wasn’t so sure and I really wanted to get to know Connor as he was really really good looking and had took more initiative than Sam. I felt as I was in a talking stage with Sam though and he is really sweet and cute so I felt bad, in the end I just said no and kept talking to Sam. Over two weeks later someone had s house party and everyone who knew us kept saying how me and Sam would make out with each other at the party, so we went outside and when it came to it, he said he had never kissed anyone before and never had a talking stage or girlfriend or anything. I said I didn’t mind and said that we could just tell all our friends we made out, since he didn’t want to or whatever and he agreed, Throughout the course of November and December this happened a lot, me and Sam were talking and getting more and more serious, all the while we would never kiss, and would tell our friends that we did. During November and December as well, Connor wouldn’t stop looking at me, I would catch him staring all the time. His friends would often make jokes when they say me saying oh Connor theres your girl! Omg Connor go shoot your shot bro, go talk to her! One of my friends is in the grade above, (in Connor’s grade) and told me that Connor is always telling her how much he likes me and he thinks im extremely pretty. Especially in December, people would come up to me and say omg did you see Connor looking at you?! He definitely likes you! He would even text me sometimes asking for school supplies or something. This was all happening while I was talking to Sam, and people would also tell me that he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend soon, and a lot of people in my grade would say how we are so cute together, and the best couple in the grade. Not a lot of people outside of the boarding house knew about Connor, they only knew about sam. Anyways at the end of December, Sam asked me to be his girlfriend! I said yes of course, and he got me really cute, expensive, personalised gifts for my December birthday and Christmas. So everything is great right?! But we’ve been going out for a month now and still haven’t kissed, he said we will eventually but he just doesn’t know how, so I say thats fine, I’ll wait. Meanwhile Connor is still always looking at me. I never really had feelings for Connor, or at least I don’t think I did, until this week. At the start of this week I started thinking about him for some reason, nothing in me and Sam’s relationship has changed, I just did. This was happening all week in little bursts, until Thursday. On Thursday I thought about him so much. I felt so guilty but I couldn’t help it, my mind would think stop. This is where it gets messy. In the evenings, boarders have the option to do extra study, I know Connor is always there, but that’s beside the point. I had a lot of work to do so I go to the extra study. I happened to sit on a random table, but little did I know that it was the table beside where Connor and his friends had already set up. They had gone to the bathroom. They came back and saw me, working.  His friends started making the usual jokes such as oooh your girl is here, etc. But then they got more intense. They started telling us to talk to each other and for him to shoot his shot, that I want him so bad by coming here and we need to just talk to each other. I started to blush but just said nothing and kept working. My friend in his grade came over to me, and started talking to me and then one of his friends came over innocently and asked what I was studying, to which I replied biology. His friend and mine then started to include Connor in the conversation saying do you remember when we did Biology in her grade, omg it was so much easier, etc. I said nothing and kept on working, but I couldn’t help but look at him now and then, he was so hot. That was last night. When I got back to the boarding house I told my friends that his friends were making the regular jokes, and this time they got a bit annoyed saying his friends should know by now that I have a boyfriend, and I’m not interested. I didn’t say anything. I went to bed last night and couldn’t sleep, all I could think about was Connor, how he has liked me since the same time Sam liked me, and has wanted to kiss me this whole time. I felt so guilty and got barely any sleep. When I finally did sleep, I ironically dreamt about Connor. i was really annoyed at my subconscious because I’ve never dreamt about Sam! The dream was about how Sam had never existed, and that one night Connor snuck into my room in residence, and we talked for ages and I fell asleep in his arms. I woke up with immense guilt. What’s wrong with me?! Then I saw Connor at breakfast multiple times. We made eye contact a lot, and he even smiled at me a couple times. I’m sick. Sam treats me so well, why am I like this?! I saw him again throughout the day, intense eye contact. If im being completely honest as well, I can’t stop thinking about Connor. I’ve tried not to and he keeps coming up in my mind. I think I like him and I hate it. I’ve been so stressed about this all day and my friends asked me what was wrong, I told 2 of them and said hopefully I feel different after the weekend. I even looked up Connor on social media… please help me, I feel so awful and don’t know what to do"

I understand that this hurt him every badly but at the same time that’s a really touchy topic for me, he ended up blocking me after going back and forth for awhile and my mom ended up finding out due to me being extremely emotional. Mind you, this all happened yesterday, and my parents think me and the boy I was talking to did something due to me being emotional but i’m just an extremely emotional girl like i really liked him and the boy I lost it to was the hoe of the school and I really didn’t find out til after; I didn’t wanna be judged for a mistake that I made in the past like i felt guilty, and I felt ashamed. I feel like you could really picture the situation. And i don’t wanna bicker or fight about it w my parents.. So moral of the story is, what birth control recommendations does anybody have that doesn’t cause weight gain? If anything I need something that helps with weight loss and is also safe."

Me (17M) and my girlfriend (17F) have been together for 4 months, and shes absolutely incredible, I know 4 months isnt a lot but shes great, the problem is her parents, in my opinion, theyre emotionally abusive, making her feel guilty for wanting to spend time with me, they have recently limited us by telling her shes only allowed to see me twice a month. Im okay with that, if it’s temporary, but her mom is not nice to my girlfriend, but she has been nice to me, opposite with her dad though, her dad has been nice to my girlfriend about me, apart from calling me names to her, like “dickhead” and other things, and to me, hes been worse than her mom, so strict and honestly scary.

I hate how much they control my girlfriend and our relationship. We are both adults next year. I just wish they went a little easier on the controlling. They originally only allowed her to date when she would go to university, but thats somehow changed, the mental load of her parents is draining, I want to stay with her, ive said i want to stay with her through this as I hope itll change, I just hope around 6 months theyll see me in a slightly different light, her mom doesn’t believe that we are serious.

I’m a very stressed, anxious and sentimental girl.

The problem is my situation at home: we don't really have the means to pay for my studies, to pay for a small housing(for me) The problem is that I don't have state aid (my parents are at the limit and my father spends his money very badly, our rent is expensive)

My father is a little alcoholic, smokes cannabis since he was very young and I think he is bipolar but he does not want to follow therapy. He is very violent in his words. My mother is quite unhealthy: she lies and stalks me, and does not take me seriously.

I don't blame them because they also have big traumas and still love me very much.

I have a boyfriend (who is going to study a few hundred km away) whom I love more than anything and thanks to whom I understood that the situation at home is abnormal.

Only I don't know if next year I will have the strength to stay with my parents, I'm afraid of not surviving mentally and doing something stupid. But I don't know if spending the savings I have on housing is a good solution. I feel guilty because sometimes I have a great time with my parents

1qfyso3,Should I meet an old friend to clear the air?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I had a close friend back in college. We’d grab lunch sometimes, and since she lived near my office, we’d meet occasionally even after she left college midway. I encouraged her to finish her degree, but she chose not to.

I’ve had a small crush on her for a long time, but I never acted on it. Eventually, we grew distant. One day she joked about getting married, which made me a bit sad. Later, she invited me over when no one was home. We got high, talked about relationships, and she admitted the marriage thing was just a joke. In that moment, I asked if we could make out — she said no, and I respected that. I felt guilty afterward and apologized over WhatsApp, but she ignored the message.

Months later, she randomly messaged me on Instagram, bragged about her trip, then disappeared again. Now I feel like I should meet her and clear the air, but I’m not sure if that’s the right move.

My question: Should I reach out and suggest meeting, or just let things be? I don’t want to make her uncomfortable, but I also don’t want lingering guilt to define this friendship."
1qhb8fc,Reasons for my rebellious,Social,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"When I was little and there was someone serious with rebellious teenage colors or a character who didn't fit in, I simply made fun of them, believing it was fake, and as punishment, this happened to me. I'm Latina and I never liked Spanish music, only English music, and I never had many friends, doing stupid things to fit in. My parents hit me, so as a teenager, for my 15th birthday, I didn't wear dresses and I didn't like pretty things like pink. I didn't want to be treated like a princess, so I wore dark colors and listened to rock and heavy metal, making me feel strong and rebellious.  Besides, I've always been a sensitive girl, so what affects one person affects me twice as much, like the rejection from my classmates for not having the same tastes. I felt very guilty when I rejected my only friend because she was very cheerful and innocent, and since she reminded me of the innocence I had lost, I simply stopped being her friend. She reminded me of myself when I was little, something that made me feel guilty but also peaceful. So rebellion was my way of surviving. I suffer from epileptic seizures where I become paralyzed. My mother is very critical and aggressive, and my father has nervous problems, and they both hit me, causing me trauma and low self-esteem during my adolescence, which made me rebellious, listening to dark, heavy music. If they liked something, I would embrace something dark that they wouldn't like or tolerate. In reality, I do respect authority, but sometimes I feel strong and rebellious because of my very different tastes and not following what my family expected of me. Even my aunt was surprised because there was a Latina singer that everyone loved, and I couldn't stand her, which is true, and she was surprised, and that strangely made me happy and feel rebellious. If something is in fashion, I don't follow it, and I look for another dark or traditional way to dress, as if I were in another era, without following trends or what others say."

That's when my step dad drinks his alcohol and starts getting nasty, then when I go upstairs cause I don't wanna deal with his ass and everyone looks at me like im the problem. My mom messaged me and said ""stop acting like hes the enemy"" but i feel like I'm the only one who holds him accountable for what hes done. He's went on rampages, broke and threw furniture, punched holes in the walls, hit my brother when he defended my mom​. I can recognize a bottle of whiskey being put down on the counter vs a plate. The second i hear something breaking or yelling my heart pounds. He's almost all of it infront of my little sister too. She hates loud noises now or yelling and hates when hes drinking. Should a 3 year old be telling her mom her stomach was turning after they fought? It's not fair to any of us especially her. When I was younger we didn't have the best life, my biological dad was on drugs and hit my mom. We didn't have much food or a car and eventually left my dad to move down where my step dad lived. They complain about working, about taking care of us. I feel useless and unloved. My step dad pays the bills and puts food on the table but isn't there for us emotionally, hes just there. My mom comes home and instead of asking me how my day was she complains about how ""dirty"" the house is after we all spent two hours cleaning. I can't wait to turn 18 and leave. I don't care if I don't have a place to stay or money im still getting out. Home is supposed to be a safe space yet as I get older I feel less and less safe.

1qenoa3,i have a crush on a friend’s ex. what should i do?,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"i am a 16 year old girl, and i have a crush on someone i feel i shouldn’t like. 

my friend Ava dates a lot of boys that usually don’t last very long. they normally break up after a week or two of dating, and most of the time she breaks up with them because she doesn’t like them anymore. 

she dated this boy, Adam, who i thought was pretty cute even before they started talking. They dated for about two weeks, and broke up because she ghosted him while they were dating. Adam was friends with Ruby’s boyfriend, which is how Adam and Ava started dating in the first place, because Ruby and her boyfriend set them up. after Ava and Adam broke up, Ruby became friends with Adam which Ava told me she was angry about, which i can understand even though Ava was the one that did Adam dirty.

A month or two went by since Ava and Adam broke up, and Ava currently has a new boyfriend that she is telling me about. However, a couple weeks ago, Ruby told me that Adam was talking about me and said that i was cute. And like i said, i had thought he was cute as well even before him and Ava dated. 

Ruby told Adam that i thought he was cute too, and now we are texting each other… Ruby told me that he is trying to make a move on me soon.

now im feeling guilty, since i know that she and Adam dated, and Ava is my really good friend that i don’t want to lose. However, if it were me in this situation, i personally would not feel any anger or jealousy if my friend wanted to date my ex given the amount of time they dated for, the fact that she didn’t even like him while they were dating (since she ended up ghosting him), AND she has a new boyfriend as of right now. 

I really don’t know what to do in this situation, as i don’t want to upset her at all, nor do i want to break girl code… but given the circumstances it seems it would be okay for me to go all in.

1qc8hqm,Am i doing the right thing?,Advice,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"Hi everyone.
I’m writing this because I’ve been stuck in the same emotional situation for a long time and I need outside perspectives, even critical ones. Almost everything I’m about to describe happened while I was still in high school, and now I’m in a transition period before starting college, so I feel like I need to close this chapter in the healthiest way possible.

Here’s the context:

I met this girl and for several months we were just friends. Over time, we both started developing feelings for each other. We talked a lot, flirted, and there was clearly a strong connection. However, when it came time to define things, she told me she didn’t want a serious relationship because she didn’t have time and because she was afraid of relationships with men, especially on an emotional and sexual level.

By that point, I was already in love with her, but I tried to respect her decision and stay friends. Over time, she started seeing other people. Rationally, I understood that she had every right to do so, and I even tried to be happy for her, but emotionally it hurt a lot. Instead of communicating properly, I made a mistake: I slowly distanced myself without explaining why. I became cold, avoided interacting with her, and that ended up hurting the friendship. Later on, we talked about it and I acknowledged that it was immature of me to disappear like that.

During the period when we were already distanced and not really talking, something happened that affected me deeply. One day she arrived at school drunk due to a very painful personal situation (her longtime pet was about to die). While she was drunk, she told me she loved me, that I was the love of her life, cuddled up to me, held my hand, and kissed me on the cheek. Later, she barely remembered any of it. Because we weren’t talking at the time, that moment confused me even more, and I emotionally clung to it, even though it later made me feel guilty.

Eventually, we talked again and “fixed” things, remaining friends. She knows that I still have feelings for her, although I tried not to have expectations.

While I was somewhat distanced, she started feeling attracted to someone from our school who also happened to be a former close friend of mine from elementary school. At the time, I didn’t give it too much importance because she kept saying she didn’t want anything serious and that it would probably just be something casual.

Later on, when we were already talking again, she mentioned in front of me that she had developed feelings for this guy, even though at that point they were just talking as friends and she was involved in another casual relationship. That hurt a lot, although I tried to hide it. Eventually, it became hard to conceal, and she noticed something was wrong.

One day we went out alone and talked about it. She told me she didn’t want anything serious at the moment, that she cared deeply about me, that her family wanted us to be together, and that she herself had considered it. However, she also said that because we both are on the autism spectrum to some degree, because she’s had bad relationships in the past, because I’ve never been in a relationship, and because we are very good friends and she doesn’t want to lose me, she felt it wasn’t the right time. She said that maybe in the future we could be something.

That conversation gave me some peace, even regarding the guy she had developed feelings for. Things were relatively calm for about two weeks. Then she announced that she ended the casual relationship she was in because it was very toxic and that she had feelings for the other guy. That left me very confused, because I didn’t know whether what she had told me before was genuine or not.

After that, they started talking more, flirting, and they are now in a relationship.

We have already graduated from high school, and we are currently in the vacation period before starting college. During this time, I decided to distance myself from her again—not out of anger, but because I don’t want to interfere with her new relationship and because I need to try to move on from my feelings. She told me she understands my reasons for distancing myself, that she doesn’t want to lose me, and that she has tried to be as considerate of my feelings as possible.

I’m about to start college in a month, and honestly, I want to begin this new stage of my life in a positive way, without carrying the same emotional pain. The last times we spoke were only to wish each other a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

The main issue is this: as foolish as it may sound, I still have feelings for her. I know that’s already a problem, given that she’s in a relationship. Even if I manage to get over her, I’m afraid that if we remain friends, those feelings could resurface again in the future.

I don’t know if I’m being a bad person for distancing myself again, or if this is simply self-preservation. I don’t have many people I can talk to about this in depth, which is why I’m posting here."
1qcweaq,"I shoplifted and feel terrible, am I gonna be charged?",Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"wanted to preface by saying this happened because I was being stupid and I just don’t have the money and some people I know shoplift regularly so I wasn’t thinking but now the guilt hits me every time I enter a shoppers drug mart. 

I’m 16 years old and over the past year (2025) stole a couple things, I know it’s bad and I am extremely guilty. It’s only ever been 1-2 teams and it’s been no more than 15 times, I had a really hard year and I guess it made me feel cool? Anyways I’m really anxious about it and have vowed to never steal going forward. However today I was in shoppers buying a lipgloss and the manager was talking to officers about shoplifting and it really freaked me out, I know I haven’t taken a significant amount but I understand big stores like this have facial recognition and I was wondering when does shoppers drug mart (or stores similar) start pursuing legal action? 

I’ve probably taken around like 300$ worth of stuff just because of how expensive things are, it’s been a few hair dyes and some makeup but I am only now realizing how quick it adds up; which is only making me feel worse 

I understand I am extremely unlikely to be charged however I want some insight to ease my anxiety. I literally feel terrible please don’t lecture me in the comments just give me advice or insight please! "
1qc0gnt,Guy asked me out because of a dare,Rant,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"This happened a few days ago but I thought I’d just rant about it anyways. I  have a friend I’ll fake name “Caden” and he has a friend I’ll also fake name “Kyle”. I am friends with both of them and they are in a big friend group of other guys and they hang out often. And one night Kyle texted me saying “I want you ❤️” Instantly I was shocked and confused as we hadn’t talked in 2 weeks and I don’t know how he managed to “want” me as he knows NOTHING about me whatsoever, we have talked a few times. So I assumed it was a joke and I replied with “I can’t tell if your messing with me lol” and then he replied with “I’m not messing with you, will you go out with me?” And then I felt a bit guilty and didn’t want to hurt him. But considering I’d lost my relationship 3 just months ago (I was extremely in love with my ex) and also considering I knew nothing about him and he lived all the way in another country. I rejected him. I did it in a really understanding paragraph that explained why I didn’t want a relationship etc. and he said “That’s fine I understand”. So I left it a Few hours and texted Caden. And mid conversation I said “I got asked out earlier” and he said “I know” and I said “I’m confused at how he developed feelings for me because \*Insert reasons\*” and he then replied “Ima be straight up with you” “it was a dare” and I instantly felt PISSED. Because I had been feeling EXTREMELY low about my breakup and I really did not need a stupid dare on me. And Kyle knew what I’d been going through, so I removed him straight away and thanked Caden for telling me. I kind of wish Caden would have told me that Kyle was trying to ask me out as a dare, and I kind of am worried at the thought that maybe if I had gotten with Kyle, I’d Caden would have told me it was a dare at all.

1qbvpjj,How to break disappointing news to your parents?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I'm currently 17 and almost out of high school; i've been following a pre-med private class for about a year to prepare for the medical school admission test (italian system), but i've lately realized that I don't want to actually be a doctor, and i'd rather explore other medical-related careers. Unfortunately, i don't think the news will sit right with my parents and i'm deathly afraid of disappointing them. I love both my parents so much and i think we have a closer bond than most teens with their parents. They have been divorced since i was 9, and i always make spending a fair amount of time with both of them one of my top priority. 

I feel particularly guilty about my choice because the private class wasn't cheap, and my dad paid for it entirely. We're pretty comfortable economically speaking but he brought up how much he paid it many times during discussions and to me it feels like i'd prove to him that he wasted money on something unnecessary. That's why i was considering renouncing on doing anything on my 18th birthday (instead of the trip my relatives were planning to gift me) to use the money to repay him, even if they won't probably be enough. Anyway, that's not the main issue: i just feel like if i disappointed my parents i couldn't live with the guilt. Any advice? How should i break the news to them?"

1q953vk,I (18M) accidentally became the closest person in her life… and now it’s destroying everything.,Relationship,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I (18M) have been close to a girl (18F) for almost two years, and honestly, it never felt like “just friendship.” We talk every day, we share everything, we know each other better than anyone else. It’s the kind of bond people usually build after dating, but somehow we had it without any label.
A year ago she dated a guy for a month. It didn’t work and it ended quietly. Recently he came back, and that’s when everything exploded.
Through all this time, she always treated me differently. She would say she loves me, she cried at the thought of losing me, she shared things she has never shared with anyone — even intimate pictures, which I never asked for. She always said, “You’re my closest person, you have to see everything.”
And I? I fell for her. Hard. But I never forced anything. I confessed once, she said she wasn’t ready, and I stayed. Maybe I stayed too much.
When she finally told that guy about me, he was shocked. He asked her why she never mentioned me while they were dating, how she could be this close to someone for two years and never say it. He even said if his female friend was this close to him for so long, he would have chosen her first. Then he practically asked her to choose.
She panicked. Didn’t sleep the whole night. Cried.
She told me she didn’t want to lose me.
She told her friends she feels more “sukoon” with me than with anyone else.
And her friend even said, “Don’t throw away two years of bond for someone you knew for a month.”
She admitted something that broke me completely—
that she couldn’t share everything with him because all her emotional needs were already being fulfilled by me.
That if I wasn’t in her life, she would have told him everything.
That maybe she treated him like an option without realizing it.
Now she feels guilty, confused, and overwhelmed. She’s distant because she’s trying to fix things with him… but she’s also scared of losing me.
And I’m here, trying to support her, even if it hurts like hell.
I don’t know what happens next.
I just know I don’t want to lose her.
Not after everything. Not after two years of connection that felt more real than anything I’ve ever known."
1q844yt,AITA for having feelings and wanting either boundaries or answers in a 'friendship'?,Advice,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I (17F) have a close friend, “Riley” (17F, identifies with any pronouns). We became very close in the winter of 2024 when we were both 15. Since then, our relationship has been emotionally intense and increasingly confusing for me.

The big swell of this happened in the summer of 2024, Riley introduced me to *Good Omens*. She talked a lot about how much she related to Crowley and how Aziraphale reminded her of me. I watched the show quickly and got really into it too. Their relationship isn’t subtle, they are explicitly written as lovers and they kiss in the show. She didn't mention that.

During that phase, Riley would constantly say very flirty things to me and send posts that were clearly romantic in tone, but she would label them “/p” to mean platonic like that would erase it. The problem was that what she was saying or sending didn’t actually feel platonic at all. It felt like the tone tag was being used to override the content itself. Later on in our friendship, we stopped using tone tags altogether, which only made things more confusing for me. Sometimes I would even ask her to use them out of fear of misunderstanding her. Well.. here we are.

At the same time, we leaned into the *Good Omens* dynamic. It started as a fandom bit, but it didn’t stay that way. I lightened my hair and found myself copying Aziraphale’s posture and phrases without meaning to. Riley darkened her already red hair, wore more black, flirted more, and leaned into Crowley’s persona. We shared romantic fanart of the characters constantly.

Our real-life relationship also became very physically and emotionally close. We cuddled, she laid her legs on me, hugged me from behind in public, and we told each other “I love you” regularly (with and without that tone tag). Riley often said we were “beyond a normal friendship” but that it “didn’t have to be romantic and that we could just be what we wanted to be."" the thing is, more recently she's been calling me her bestfriend.

Every time I saw romantic fanart of the characters kissing or being affectionate, I felt a strong emotional reaction — not discomfort, but longing. We’ve briefly acknowledged that our dynamic feels different, but we always gloss over it instead of actually talking about what it means. Meanwhile, Riley talks about liking other people, and I feel stuck waiting in an undefined space. I love her.

For further context, we are both part of a strict, faith-based youth theater company that doesn’t allow dating at all.. not even heterosexual dating (But ESPECIALLY the queer kind). Throughout our friendship, I’ve been openly her lesbian friend, while Riley has been in a lot of uncertainty about her identity. Because of our environment and that uncertainty, nothing was ever clearly addressed and we can't talk about it in our theater environment. (this is where we met and interact most of the time)

I don’t think she’s intentionally trying to hurt me, but I don’t think she realizes how real and heavy this has become for me. Recently, I reached a breaking point and realized I can’t keep existing in a relationship that is emotionally intimate but undefined.

I want either honesty about whether there’s something more here, or I need to set boundaries around physical affection and emotional closeness so I can protect myself. Now I feel guilty, like I’m overthinking or asking for too much, or that I’m misreading something that was “never meant that way.”

AITA for having feelings and wanting either clarity or boundaries, even if it changes our friendship?

also ive never done one of these before but Riley is usually the person I talk to.. but this is about them."

1q7qkxt,sort of a vent about my life,Serious,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"\- for context i am nearly 16, i am a Christian and i have a very loving family and great friends. this is sort of a vent but also i need advice because i am lost. i feel guilty about not enjoying life because as a Christian i am supposed to find my worth in God and feel fulfilled in that way but I am also extremely depressed (yes I have been diagnosed, i see a therapist as well) and i struggle with cutting myself. i did it a lot last year, and then i was 238 days clean and i messed up and did it again last week. the disappointment and guilt it killing me. i saw my therapist since then but i didn't tell her. i could tell my brother or my parents but i want to keep it to myself even though they wouldn't get mad.

  
i don't want to tell my friends, they already know about all of my past cutting instances and how i'm depressed, and i really don't feel like asking them because i feel so distant somehow. they are very close to me and ive known most of them since i was very young since I go to a small Christian private school and most of our friend group (myself included) has been going there from a young age. but everybody in the group has one best friend, even though we're all close, but i don't have that one best friend. i feel distant. i'm introverted and don't make an effort to reach out a lot of times, and i rarely text or call my friends. i hang out with them when i have to but i sometimes isolate. i feel like such a stupid loser for isolating. and i'm always questioning if they like me or not. it's also hard to connect over certain stuff because i have completely opposite interests from all of them. i like video games and art and anime and stuff like that, but they all like reading or something and don't really have hobbies. there's very slight overlap, but i just don't feel like i connect with them over a lot of stuff, but i still appreciate them so so much and i wouldn't choose any other friend group. so they are not the problem.

  
honestly i just wish i was happy. i can barely pull myself out of bed to get to school, and every time i get stressed from school i legitimately want to kill myself or cut myself because i just feel stretched so thin that im going to break. ive lied to my parents saying im sick when in reality i just feel so depressed and numb that i can't get up to go to school, or sometimes my body will shut down from depression. i do not talk to anybody about my problems which is absolutely stupid because i have friends, family, and a therapist, but my self doubt makes me not trust them, despite them all being super trustworthy. unfortunately i am very good at hiding my struggles, as i still get ready and put on makeup and shower and all that to go out of the house. but i think that's also body image issues. it's my face that's the problem, i think my body is fine, im really skinny but not unhealthy looking, but i hate my face so much. i feel ugly, so i put a lot of effort into how i dress and look. i know i can't be that ugly because my friends tell me i'm pretty and they're honest people, but i feel disgusted when i look at myself. i feel like an idiotic failure and i hate looking at my own face, so i put on makeup and i try to feel better about it. i think if i didn't feel so ugly i probably wouldn't put so much effort into getting ready every day because the truth is i'm so exhausted. the thought of leaving the house makes me want to die, and im so tired of taking forever to get ready to go anywhere because i lack any motivation to get up and look presentable but i have to, and i hide my struggle, and i don't know what to do. 

  
nothing feels like it fulfils me anymore. there's no point in doing anything, and all the games and shows i love i just don't enjoy much anymore. i have no motivation to watch shows or play video games much anymore, and i love drawing but i feel no motivation to draw a lot, and i feel very disappointed in myself. i just want to enjoy life and hobbies again.

  
 i don't really know where this is going. i just feel terrible and guilty and like i'd be better off dead. and back to the thing about me being a Christian, i was raised that way and have always had a strong desire to have a relationship with God. but im so lazy and i find myself not putting in the work, never really reading my Bible and stuff. i've prayed and wanted to talk to God about all of this but I never feel like a get an answer. I really need His help and don't know what to do anymore. i just feel super overwhelmed and i don't want to talk to anybody about this, so if anyone has advice let me know. im sorry this was more of a vent than asking for advice but if anyone could make sense of that could i get some advice? thanks guys."
1q6cdl4,Accidentally led a girl on and now idk how to end things. Please Help Me.,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I know I’m probably going to sound like a bitch for this, but I started chatting with this girl during winter break, and what began as mild interest slowly turned into nothing on my end. At first, I thought maybe I just needed more time to get to know her, but the more we talked, the more I realized my feelings were fading instead of growing. Now I’m at a point where I don’t feel any romantic interest at all, and it honestly makes me feel guilty because I know she doesn’t feel the same way.

We would text constantly and sometimes even call for hours, but if I’m being completely honest, for me it was mostly just something to pass the time during break. I didn’t have much going on, and the attention was easy to fall into. I think that’s what makes this worse. I didn’t mean to lead her on, but I can see how it definitely looks that way from her perspective. She was investing emotionally, while I was just filling empty time.

Now that winter break is over, things feel way more real. She wants to hang out with me at school, and that’s when it really hit me that I don’t want this to continue. The idea of spending time together in person makes me uncomfortable, not because she did anything wrong, but because I know my heart isn’t in it. Every time she brings it up, I feel more trapped, like the longer I avoid ending things, the worse it’s going to be.

What makes it even harder is that I can’t bring myself to be direct. Every time I try to pull back or hint that I’m not interested, I end up saying the wrong thing or continuing the conversation anyway, which just digs me deeper into this situation. I hate confrontation, and I hate knowing I might hurt her, but avoiding it is honestly making everything worse.

On top of all that, my birthday is coming up, and she’s already said she wants to get me something. The thought of her spending money or effort on me when I already know I want to end things makes me feel awful. I definitely don’t want her to do that, and I know the longer I wait, the more unfair it becomes to her.

I know I need to end this, I just don’t know how. I also don’t want to keep pretending or leading her on when I already know this isn’t what I want. Please help me out. I already know that I’m a dickhead I just don’t want to become a bigger one by continuing to lead her on."

1q2qti2,would like some advice (16F),Advice,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I feel like no matter what I do, I’m always messing things up. I’m constantly aware of my actions and how they affect other people, and I go out of my way to make sure I don’t upset anyone.

I think about everything I do before I do it, and even then I still end up feeling like I’ve done something wrong. When people get angry at me, I don’t argue back or point fingers. I just stand there and take it, even when I’m panicking inside, because I don’t want to make things worse. I feel like I’m always being blamed, like I’m under a microscope in my own family. Every mistake feels amplified when it’s me. 

I notice things about myself that others probably wouldn’t even register, and I already feel guilty before anyone says anything. I try so hard to avoid getting into trouble, yet it feels like I’m always failing anyway. My OCD controls so much of my life. I struggle massively with contamination fears and cleanliness, and I don’t feel like I’ve ever been taught how to cope properly. I take a long time showering because it’s the only way I can feel clean enough to function. If I don’t do things in a certain way, my anxiety becomes unbearable. I know it causes issues, and I feel terrible about that, but I don’t know how to do it differently right now.

I’m not doing this because I don’t care it’s because my brain won’t let me feel safe otherwise. The same goes for my skin routine and using lots of cotton pads/skincare. I know it looks excessive, and I feel guilty about wasting money, but stopping makes me feel distressed and out of control. I hate that my coping mechanisms inconvenience other people. I hate that my illness shows up in ways that people can see. I don’t have therapy or proper support at the moment, and it feels like I’m expected to just cope anyway. Because of that, I blame myself constantly. I feel like it’s my fault that I have OCD, that I have an eating disorder, that I have social anxiety. I feel like I should have been stronger or better or different somehow. 

My eating disorder was at its worst when I was younger, and even though my weight is considered healthy now, eating is still difficult. My body image is worse, not better, and I struggle with body dysmorphia every day. I find myself watching pro‑ana content even though I know it harms me, because I don’t know how else to cope with the feelings. I distance myself from people and convince myself I’m not worthy of friendships. At school, I often isolate myself, staying in the library instead of socialising, because I feel awkward, out of place, and like everyone would be better off without me. 

I blame myself for everything that’s happened to me, including the way people have treated me. When friends said horrible things about my appearance, I internalised it. I didn’t know how to make myself look “right” I was just trying to avoid sensory discomfort and anxiety but I still told myself it was my fault for being ugly or strange. I carry so much shame about who I was as a child and who I am now. I hate myself for past behaviour, even when I was struggling and didn’t understand what was happening to me. 

Sometimes I feel like my family still sees me as a problem as difficult, selfish, lazy, or a burden rather than as someone who is trying their absolute best while dealing with mental illness. It hurts deeply to feel misunderstood and reduced to my worst moments. I feel like I ruin things just by existing, like I damage everything I touch. 

I’ve self‑harmed because the self‑hatred gets so overwhelming and I feel like I deserve punishment. It feels like I’m constantly being punished anyway. And yet, despite all of this, I don’t want to die. I want to live. I want to be happy. I just don’t know how to get there when I feel trapped in guilt, fear, and shame all the time. I’m not uncaring or ungrateful or selfish like i might have been when i was younger. I feel so hyper aware, overly responsible, and constantly trying not to hurt anyone. I wish people could see how much effort it takes just for me to exist or how much thought I put into things, rather than dismiss me to my actions. 

I've been struggling mentally since late 2021/2022, but also when I was younger, though I can't remember much, just that I was annoying and rude, maybe I can't remember how I was treated due to my brain blocking it out, but I've always felt like I just don't belong in my family and now with my friends or anywhere, I just want this suffering to stop, but every year it continuously get worse, and I know I need to get back into therapy, but when I get discharged, the cycle starts all over. Will I ever be okay? Will I ever be happy? I feel like everyone is quick to move on and grow up but I really hate change, and I feel like I'm loosing myself each second I get older. I'm so scared about the future, about my mental state, about my career/jobs, but I want to feel like I fit in, and not feel like a burden to everyone or that I'm doing something wrong, but I just don't know anymore. 

Sorry if this is too long for your attention span, but if you did read all of this, thank you, thank you so much, I really appreciate it."
1pz83h9,Parentification is a bitch,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Having to watch my siblings has made me grown genuine resentment towards ever having my own children, especially as someone in a blended family of whom had to watch my step siblings and baby half brother, it is also horrible since i obviously love them like siblings and i always feel guilty when i try to explain to my dad that i don’t want to, (who then essentially tries to turn the blame on me). Sometimes i find it quite sad that i don’t want kids because of this, since it’s not necessarily my fault, i guess since being the eldest daughter (and forcibly the most mature) my dad and stepmom just assumed i had some kind of parental instinct already. I also always have to listen to my dad and mom complain about each-other, and comfort one another, this primarily happens with my dad who is told multiple times to stop talking shit about my mom, i hate it so fucking much, i’m so tired, you are adults, i am 15 i don’t want to hear about what my mom did to piss you off, or how she is ruining my life, or why she doesn’t want to put my brother on adhd medication.

i am just a generally nice person and yes, i have my moments like everyone, but this earlier on today really bugged me.

 basically i (16f) went out today with my cousin (also 16f) for a shopping day. we went into Next (clothing) and we saw some perfumes, which had the deal 3 for the price of 2. she wanted to get one for her sisters birthday, and also got one herself, so i said to her to get me one as well so the deal works, and that i'd transfer whatever money it was to her later. anyways later comes and we are sitting on a bench, and i say ill transfer the money over now, and she says to me that i owe her £18. i am sitting there knowing for a fact it was only £9 i owed her for the one perfume, but she kept insisting because apparently this perfume bottle was £18 alone and the total she paid was £30 (like where do you even get that from)

 if you think about it, if its buy 3 for the price of 2, n each bottle costs £9, she should only be paying 18 total. so she basically wanted me to pay the price of 2. if it was the other way round, and i bought one for free, and she said she would transfer it id be like no its okay dw about it and let her have it not insistently demand her to pay the full price! 

eventuually the app didnt work anyways so i didnt pay but its just the fact that she knew i would be too uncomfortable to say anything out loud (i used to be such a people pleaser in the past when i was younger i was  bullied cause of it and everything) 

  
on top of that we've had strained relationships in the past which i thought were over, but clearly she'll always be selfish. its not even about money atp cause my fam literally quite a low income and are on benefits, and her parents are educated and have good jobs. 

  
she also stole some earrings from Primark, and walked out like nothing had happened. im there feeling guilty af and she doesnt even care or even have a guilty conscience. 

  
it's also not as easy as cutting her ot of my life aswell bc my dads side of the family gossip about everyone (i made a post abt them), and shes from my mums side which is quite closeknit. if i told her mum she would get in a lot of trouble but i cba being a snitch.

even with friends, its always me having to contact them first, im such a loser and a loner in life and i just feel so crap

  
**tldr: my cousin demanded i pay extra for her perfume, and i was too uncomfortable to say no, even my friends dont bother contacting me**."

1pyn3xt,"I feel guilty using my phone (16, guy)",Serious,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I don’t really know what to do. When I sit with my phone, I feel bad, like I should be doing something more useful.

I’ve started helping my family in the kitchen and spending time with them (that usually takes about 2 hours). I exercise for 1 hour (I’m planning to sign up for a gym — in my country that’s allowed at my age). I also read for about 1 hour lately, and I draw for around 30 minutes.

Altogether, that’s about 4.5 hours. I try to wake up at 6 a.m. and go to sleep at 9 p.m., so I’m awake for about 13 hours a day.

Recently, I’ve also been studying for about 3 hours a day, so that makes around 7.5 hours. I also clean my room for about 20 minutes every day, which brings it to roughly 8 hours total. Of course, I still need time for eating, going to the bathroom, and other basic things, so maybe that makes around 9 hours in total.

Still, I always feel guilty when I use my phone because I feel like I’m addicted. But I also know I need to use it — there’s no way to completely avoid it. I just always feel guilty about it.

1q4k7eq,I don’t want to go back to school,Rant,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I’ve just been crying and every time I think about doing school I feel like I’m gonna be sick, I think I overloaded my schedule I did summer term so I could get ahead in math and do chem and bio and I worked in the summer and then fall term I did calculus and both terms were hard I was studying and working 12 hours at least most of the time more than that and I kinda just put everything on hold like all my hobbies and extracurriculars and even the trips I planned because I didn’t think I could ever get caught back up and then I also had health issues that have been going on for a while but it flared up and I got set back and midterms went terrible and I ended up being able to pass but usually I’m a A student and it wasn’t like my standards and then winter break came and I only had one class and I got to go on a trip and not being school with me and I got to eat meals and do my hobbies again and just kinda enjoy myself and now school starts tomorrow and it’s online but still I’m feeling like I’m gonna puke over it cause I just really don’t want to do it usually I love school but I think I burned out and I really don’t want to look at any of it even my favorite subjects and I still even though I worked so hard I feel like a bad student and it doesn’t help that you know I don’t talk to teachers or my advisor it’s online and rarely and then I just feel like they think things about me- idk. And I don’t think I can really do it like I used to be motivated by a career but now I’m just like I don’t know if I can do that kinda schoolwork and I always feel like whenever I’m not doing schoolwork I’m just feeling guilty for doing anything else because no matter if I’m ahead I’m never ahead enough and what if I have another flare up and I can’t do it or what if they change something and now these teachers won’t post the whole year they do it week by week which is super hard for me. 

And the other thing too is I besides seeing them at activities which maybe if I say hi and make small talk is the most interaction I get with teenagers my age like ever I tried to go to a few things but either I have school or something else and I don’t make friends easy anyways idk why my parents say I’m more mature so I don’t fit in I doubt that’s why but I have people I know just I always text first if we make plans I always make them or host and then people don’t show up or text me a few hours before and I guess maybe people just don’t have time to hangout with kids outside of their school, but I’m trying to do something once a month with a kid my age but every time I invite someone somewhere lately they don’t come and idk what’s wrong with me I can’t do school and I can’t make friends and I’m sick all the time and always sleeping too and idk how I’m gonna do this term but anyways I’m just venting lol I don’t think most people will read all that I’ll probably take this down on a few hours or so"
1q46qe7,How do I speak to my mom?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Recently I’ve (17f) been having terrible body image issues. My anxiety has been spiraling out of control to the point where i haven’t been eating bc I feel so anxious that I’m nauseous and I know that if I eat, I’ll just end up throwing it up. The problem is, I’m already underweight for my age and the fact that I’ve been skipping meals has made me lose weight that I can’t really afford to lose. People have been making jokes abt me being a grasshopper or a stick or whatever unoriginal, offensive things they can think of and I’m just so sick of it. My whole life, my mom has always been pro-mental health- but now all of a sudden it’s like a switch has flipped. I tried to open up to her about my anxiety and she basically said “it’s your fault because you’re so busy with school” (I’m in two AP’s but I’m happy and excelling).

A few days ago, she made a comment about how I’d fit the weight capacity for a scale at the store that was drastically below my actual weight and it a) really surprised me because she never says things like that, and b) made me feel insecure in my own home. Maybe I was being sensitive, idk; I’m just not really in a place right now where I can laugh along with jokes like that. I approached her later and asked if she could just hold off on the jokes about my body for a while and she got upset and like stopped talking to me? Naturally, I felt so guilty and I apologized for being in a bad mood because of her joke and she said “I just can’t believe you ever thought I’d say something to purposely hurt you. It was just a joke. I have the same body type as you and you don’t see me complaining. Are you saying you think I look bad?” And then was going on and on about how I should be grateful I’m thin and blah blah blah but I was just so incredibly thrown off because she’s never talked to me like that. I just feel lost in this and I thought that the one person who I could trust the most with my insecurities has invalidated me. Is it even worth trying to have a conversation with her? And if so, what the heck do I even say?"
1q4z8i6,How could I help my mom?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So I’m pretty sure my mom is not feeling ok. Like mentally exhausted and things, just really tired. The thing is that, I think its bc she spends a lot of time in the car, like, 2h a day, sometimes more. And I want her to feel better. I don’t want her to stress too much or be exhausted. Another thing is, my mental health isnt the best, so I went to the doctor and told my doctor, who told my mom, so now we’re gonna go see a psychiatrist (I think Idk), and I know I’m stressing her out bc of that. I know I do not help with my problems. And it makes me really guilty. Then, my brother, him, has an ed. He goes to the kitchen at night and eats a fucking lot of food, even after snacking all day and eating enough 3 times a day. I know that stresses her out too. Well I think. So I just want ways I can make my mom less stressed. I just want to help her yk? I care about my mom, and love her, and just want the best for her. Just, any advices on how to help her? Anything would help."

1py0up8,"Hot take, addictions and commiting are over romanticized.",Discussion,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"TW: I will also mention eating disorders and self-harm. Low-key very aggressive.

This comes from someone who has gone through one of these and similar.

Yes, you heard me. Commiting and addictions are way too romanticized in this society, especially teens.

I hate how bad things are marketed especially towards teenagers. Like vapes, they were supposed to be an ""alternative for adults who were addicted to smoking"", but tell me, why are they sold as an ""aesthetic""? I doubt the average adult who wants to leave smoking will appetize a pink vape with a ""cotton candy fizz"" flavor, with a glittery packaging and modern font... If it truly was for that, it would look like the average paracetamol.

This also includes how drugs are marketed as something ""cool and edgy"". Young people see this in media. Often, even if the media itself says it's bad, there will always be that one person who wants to stand out by being a bad influence. No Timmy, you don't look cool for hiding the vape you bought with daddy and mommy's money in secret, and over that, posting it on the internet, you're just pitiful and worry people.

Oh, and porn addiction, crazy how normalized it is these days. We lack of sexual education but this content only grows more and more. Luckily I've never watched any of it. But... It's concerning how many **KIDS** already know how to access it, and end up becoming the horny ass fucks you see in this subreddit downvoting people for saying porn is bad. Then we also wonder why teen pregnancies are so common... Boys can't hold their penis and girls won't close their legs. Stop gooning and do something else, plenty of things you can do, starting with a shower.

Traumas are also so romanticized. No Emily, you wanting to have a trauma because you like storytiming is not okay. You do NOT wish to go through an event that changes your entire life, how you speak, what you think of some things, makes you nervous at almost any slight shift related to it, makes you want to avoid from places, to literal **food**. Does that look pretty or aesthetic to you? Does that look quirky enough to post on TikTok or do an indirect Instagram note? Does it look interesting enough for you to act like a starved dog in the street for attention? Go improve on other things, you'll sure achieve something *good* that will make you get the attention you so much seek.

Eating disorders? ""Girl-only"" (aha, suddenly invalid if you're a guy now, I am not a guy, btw, but this is not talked about enough.? Basically a 'princess problem', you're suddenly a ""true girly"" if you've had an ED, some of them even try to promote such actions by making them seem something trendy and cute. So many blogs that recommend *eating a single apple slice a day*  taken down... You don't want me to speak about EDtok and EDtwt, horrible spaces for people with ED's, just edgy teens promoting their shit and acting like it's a hot thing, worst part, adults with malnutrition kinks are very common to find there. And these fucks love to groom little girls into malnutritioning themselves.

Self-harm has the same problem, why did they turn it into an aesthetic, INSTEAD OF TRYING TO AVOID IT? 

Look, I understand these people have problems, and they do need help and support. In fact, I have tried to support friends I've had who were like this but some of their replies were:

""You CAN'T be doing this again, what will you do in summer if he sees it??? Tell your parents about what he's doing to uuuu""

""No :3""

... This person also reposted things like 'sh core' 'bread!', and even after trying to help the only answer was just kind of... Smug. 

Anyways, I do know not every person who does sh is like this, and many of them try to improve and avoid it. But this number of people is growing more and more, and the worst part is that there have been cases of people without problems (problems that would lead to sh) who cut themselves to get attention on the internet. If someone is going to answer me with a ""no ty \^\^"", how do they expect people to help them when they reach a worse situation? People who don't even have therapists need them way more than these *dipshits* who only want attention in the internet. I don't want to see you saying ""I don't wanna go to the therapist cuz it's boringggggg"" on your insta story. Give your chances to someone else if you're not doing anything about it.

And then you've got commiting... How can I start with this? Media usually  portrays this as 'a way to end everything'. It's always romanticized; the person always has an incredible victim complex, and that's what makes them ""quirky and interesting.""... We are not in the Romantic era and that's not how it is in real life. You cannot be trying to make that fiction reality by calling out people's attention instead of seeking help.

And with seeking help, I mean, a real person, not your AI husband, you clanker addict. Understood?

They promote it as a ""way to end everything"", supposedly, ending your problems but also your life.

In my view, this is so, so, so fucking wrong and illogical. Your life would end, BUT your problems would only extend. Yes, you will die, you will cease to exist, but the problem will pass to your family or friends. Perhaps to your teachers at school or to the neighbor. Your life has ended but you've left your friend with an empty seat besides them. Your life has ended but you've left your parents with an empty room in their house. Your life has ended but now people who knew you feel guilty for something they never understood, because instead of speaking up about it, and doing something about it, YOU FELL FOR THEIR LIES!

No, I am not mocking people who ended their lives, may they all rest in peace.

  
Remember when depression was actually cool back in 2018-2021? Starting with those ""broken"" profile pictures and the depressed Bart Simpsons? Well, I think this is the same thing. Except that in that case people were faking it, and in this case people with it PROMOTE having it to people who don't, or people who are trying to get better and overcome it.

This entire text looks like a crash out but literally hear me out, people are promoting self-destructive shit just to feel valid. That's like grabbing a perfect dish you made and let it mold for it to belong in the trash can."
1pxrnx0,Should I apologise despite it being nearly 3 years,Advice,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Ok so basically in 7th grade there was this girl in 8th that liked me, she texted first, even paid for us to go on a blind date (my old school had that during events), and since I didn't like her back, I wasn't really enthusiastic about anything. Worst part is, she or her friends, idk which paid again to arrange a blind date on valentine's and uhh well I kinda ran from the people sent to get me because.. I just didn't want to. I felt forced to keep talking to her, and being the dumb kid that I am, I basically broke her heart on valentine's without any apology or anything. Nearly 3 years forward and a school switch, I was just scrolling and stumbled on her post, then remembered everything that happened between us. Now I feel guilty about it, but still not sure whether to reach out cus it's been a while and she might just wanna forget and/or has already moved on.



TLDR: Girl liked me in 7th grade, I didn’t like her back but avoided saying it. Blind dates kept getting set up and I ran away on Valentine’s. Now it’s nearly been 3 years, I saw her post, and I feel guilty of being dumb and not apologising "
1pup02n,Does anyone else feel like they’re trying to “fix” themselves in secret?,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I don’t really know how to explain this without sounding dramatic, but lately I’ve been feeling like I’m living two lives. One life is the one everyone sees going to school, talking to people, laughing at stuff, acting normal, doing what I’m supposed to do. And the other life is what’s happening in my head where I’m constantly overthinking, feeling tired for no reason, losing motivation, and then feeling guilty because I *should* be doing better. It’s weird because I’m not always sad or anything. Sometimes I’m totally fine. But other times it feels like my mind is just heavy. Like I’m carrying a quiet pressure 24/7, and I don’t even know where it’s coming from. And I feel like a lot of us deal with this but never say it out loud. I’ve been trying to work on myself recently, but not in some perfect “glow up” way. More like I’m trying to become stable. I’m trying to stop feeling like my emotions control my whole day. I’m trying to get better sleep, drink more water, go outside more, take breaks from my phone, and actually do things that make me feel like a real person again. But I’m realizing self-improvement is harder than it looks because it’s not just about habits it’s about your mind. Like you can have the best routine in the world, but if you don’t feel okay mentally, everything feels harder. Another thing I’ve noticed is how much friends matter. Not even in a deep “talk about feelings” way all the time, but just having people that make you feel safe. People who don’t judge you. People who make life feel lighter. Because when you’re alone too much, your brain becomes your whole world, and sometimes your brain is not a fun place to live. And honestly, I think that’s why motivation comes and goes. You can watch something inspiring, feel hyped for an hour, and then the next day you’re back to feeling stuck. I’ve realized motivation isn’t what changes you it’s support, small routines, and being around people who actually get it. Like having a space where you can talk, ask questions, and see that other people are trying too. Where you can share progress, even small progress,  and it doesn’t feel embarrassing. That kind of thing makes a huge difference. So I wanted to ask  : 

Do you ever feel like you’re trying to “fix” yourself quietly without telling anyone?  
What’s something that helped you mentally, even a little?  
And how do you keep going when your motivation disappears?

because I’m starting to think a lot of us are going through it we’re just doing it alone."

1ptl87s,Can someone please help me?,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"please read this. yes i used chatgpt to get my feelings into words. i specially used points to make sure its easy to read. please dont judge me.

I have been struggling with my mental health for many years, and I’ve reached a point where I can’t handle this alone anymore. I need support, and I am trying to reach out in the safest way possible.

**1. Long-term emotional distress**

* Since childhood, I have often been **ignored, scolded, and not emotionally supported** by my family.
* My cousins frequently **bullied me**, and no one intervened.
* I grew up feeling **unheard, scared, and alone**, especially during moments when I needed help.

**2. Unhealthy body reactions to stress**

* Whenever I feel stressed, overwhelmed, sad, irritated, or pressured—especially related to studies or family conflict—my body reacts in intense ways.
* These reactions include:
   * **Severe headaches**
   * **Dizziness**
   * **Weakness in legs**
   * **Loss of focus / vision or hearing fading**
   * A feeling of **panic or dread**
* My body sometimes produces **sexual-like physical responses that I do not want**, especially during emotional distress.
* This has been happening since I was very young, and I never understood it.

**3. Current sexual distress**

* I **don’t want** anything sexual. I actually **dislike** it and feel ashamed, scared, and overwhelmed by it.
* But my body sometimes reacts automatically during emotional stress.
* This causes:
   * Overwhelm
   * Urges I don’t want
   * Guilt and self-hatred
* I sometimes try to suppress it, but then the physical symptoms (headache, dizziness, weakness) get worse.
* Emotionally, I feel disconnected from healthy sexuality, and my body reacting like this makes me feel “broken.”

**4. Harmful coping responses**

* During overwhelming moments, my mind sometimes escapes into **disturbing fantasies** that I do not want, do not like, and do not choose.
* These fantasies reduce the physical pressure temporarily, but mentally they hurt me and make me feel guilty and ashamed.
* This is not pleasure — it is **a trauma reaction + stress response** that I do not understand or control.

**5. Impact on studies and daily life**

* I am operating at maybe **15–20%** of my actual capacity.
* If I try harder, I get overwhelmed and feel like I will lose control or hurt myself.
* Because of this:
   * Studying feels impossible
   * Exams cause extreme stress
   * I fear my father’s reaction to my results

**6. Repeated attempts to seek help**

I have already tried to reach out **many times**, including:

* School counsellor
* Therapist
* Psychiatrist
* Family
* Tele MANAS emergency helpline

None of these attempts made me feel understood or supported. Some responses were dismissive or hurtful, which made things worse.

**7. Mental safety concerns**

* I have had **thoughts of dying** because the situation feels unbearable at times.
* **Right now, I am not actively trying to harm myself**, but the thoughts come when things get overwhelming.
* I sometimes fear relapsing into self-harm or unhealthy coping because I don’t feel safe at home emotionally.

**8. Why I’m reaching out now**

* I feel like I cannot keep living like this without proper help.
* My body reactions, guilt, exhaustion, and fear are destroying my ability to function, study, or stay mentally stable.
* I need someone to understand that:
   * I’m not lazy
   * I’m not doing this intentionally
   * I am genuinely overwhelmed and scared
   * I need **real support**, not judgment"

It's taken 2 weeks of small bursts of cleaning because 1. oh my god it was so much worse than it looks like and 2. I never get out of bed so physical activity is really hard for me so I couldn't do it all at once :-(

Im glad my room is clean because now i feel less guilty and embarrassed, and I also finally found myself a therapist that I'll begin seeing after the holidays to help with my mental health.

1pwvqlc,I need some advice,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I have no idea how to explain this. So, I was introduced to a girl online by a good friend. We played Roblox together, chatted so on and we became good friends. Until the person I hate suddenly joined (i'll call him stinky) . Like out of nowhere, I hadn't talked to stinky in months. He was just sitting in my friendslist. Just because i was playing with a girl he joined. Stinky and the girl became friends and all, snapchat that stuff. Stinky and I talked about the friendship between me and the girl. He said he didn't want te steal the girl so i believed that. Eventually school started and we played less together. Me and the girl just texted each other daily. But a few months I noticed she suddendly texted me much less, I was confused. Until a good friend said they were e-dating or smth.I felt betrayed I didn't know what to do. Like i didn't want to lose someone to someone i hate. I feel guilty, because I could've avoided everything. Since then i've been paranoid, burned out and depressed for a few months. I almost wanted to take my own life. I feel powerless like i can't do anything about it. Everytime I want to talk about it the just talk about another topic.
So please someone tell me what to do in this situation, I need advice.

-For the people on reddit, these are some things I learned from this and want to share, because I've been down there too:

Suffering and failures are the only way to become a better version of yourself.

When you hit the bottom, the only way you can go is up.

Suicide doesn't solve. Everyone wil talk about you for a maximum of two weeks and just forget you, because life moves on.

1psrgwp,FINAL ADVICE (The things no one tells you.),Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I haven't been here for awhile, but I'm about to turn 21 and my sister recently just turned 19, so I thought I would just give some final advice as an 'adult.'

Read it or dont, I couldn't care less, just my final goodbye.

**1. Enjoy teenager years**

Everyone says it and when they do you just wanna roll your eyes and tell the to get lost. Highschool sucks, but out here sucks more. My bank account is suffering, saved cash is gone, I'm dealing with forms from the government, I have to memorise different numbers constantly, you either have to be working or in school to get ANY help from systems. Anything you contribute now is basically nothing. It's stressful and im constantly looking at forms I dont even understand, they arent graded, you dont get second chances, if something is wrng then legal matters can be involved.

**2. Highschool friends aren't forever**

They basically just become strangers on your fyp, my best friend once childhood and I haven't spoken in almost 2 years, some stick around but probably not forever. You won't even THINK about them, they may seen like everything now, but they are nothing in the long run.

**3. Popularity**

Highschool popularity is nothing, (especially in the grade 11, 12) the ones that care about it in those grades will be the ones that 'peaked' in highschool. Eventually you all just become a big group of classmates and friends (they won't sick around, remember that!) Your image won't matter at all. So dont stress about being on top.

**4. Relationships**

Its okay to experiment and go into a relationship knowing it won't last, you learn a lot from them. It's also okay not to get involved wth anyone at all. Also virginity is stupid. Don't feel pressured to lose it asap, no one cares and you never have to talk to anyone about it. It's just a concept and medical turn, society doesn't truly care. Just be safe and ALWAYS USE PROTECTION. Some things you can't heal, once you have certain things it will always be there. Don't risk it. And dnt send pictures, its unsafe. I dont care how much you trust the person.

**5. ""You have your whole life to (blank).""**

No, you dont. Life moves fast, really fast. You dnt have forever to choose, you have to go straight into it, once you can stand for yourself you can think about switching or studying something else, but until then you are rushed to choose and youre stuck with it. You spend most of your life studying and working, dont waste it, but dont feel forced to spend every day like its your last.

**6. Mental Health**

It will get better. Sounds fake, but it will. However, you should also know it might not stay better, emotions and mental health is a rollercoaster, sometimes you have highs and other times you have lows. These can last days, months, years, but not forever, its impossible for the brain to do that. Reach out for help (there are websites that are anonymous) therapy sucks, go to psychologists or psychiatrists. It's a big difference. It's also okay to have down days and ones where you are tired, just find a hobby, something you can do from your bed so you aren't just sleeping. Mine is writing, took me years to find but I did.

**7. Cut toxic people off**

You may feel guilty at first, but if someone is hurting you then cut them off, physically, emotionally, mentally, religiously, spiritually, anything. It will eventually be a weight off your shoulders, family included. If you can't then find a support sysupport.

**8. No one will help you if you dont ask first.**

There is always someone that knows, no matter how well you hide it, but they won't help unless you ask, people have a mindset where they believe they are helpless. So, if you want help then you have to ask, it won't be given to you. The same with change. You won't change unless you commit to it.

**9. Morals**

Someone once told me I'm a canvas and society painted who I am. They were right, if you look around basically everyone is the same, they grew up already being taught by society. Choose your own morals and beliefs, think outside the box. There is a reason behind EVERYTHING, sometimes its selfish, sometimes it isnt.

**10. Survive.**

Life is hard, you are gonna spend most of it surviving. It's draining and difficult, you want to say fuck you to the world. But you can't, take each day as they come. Make connections with people, make a bucket list, and reasons to live. If you struggle to live for yourself then live for someone else.

  
I may have made life seem like crap, but it isnt...completely, there are ups and downs. 

Anyway, im done, there is more but I have things to do and errands to run, petrol, shopping, crying into my bank account. The usual.

Goodluck!"
1pseeqw,How to deal with the death of my grandfather,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So I decided to write about this today as a way to vent about this, because I don't really have anything else to talk to about this. Yesterday my dad called me and told me by there was a very low chance that he would survive his trip to a hospital because of a breathing issue.

  
Naturally, I cried like a baby for five minutes. He offered to drive 3 hours to where he was to say goodbye, I couldn't bring myself to do it and said no. I've always been a shyer person. I felt guilty that day for still playing video games and talking to my freind on the phone. 

Today this morning, my dad let me know that he passed away last night. I don't know how I didn't show any emotion. I just made my microwave breakfast, sat for a little while in scilence, and went to my room to write this story.

I don't know what is wrong with me, I thought it would hit me like a train. Im going back to school tommorrow and I feel fine. What do I do?"
1ps8d73,From personal-best GPA in Class 10 to struggling in Class 11 science - looking for guidance,School,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Hi everyone,
I’m a Class 11 science student from Nepal, and I’m writing this because I feel overwhelmed, confused, and mentally stuck, and I’m looking for genuine advice.
My academic journey hasn’t been very smooth or straightforward. I studied mostly in Nepali-medium school. I was only properly in English-medium from Nursery to Class 5, and even then my foundation wasn’t very strong. I also had grade jumps — I didn’t properly study UKG, and I skipped Class 6 and directly joined Class 7.
When I entered Class 7, it was extremely hard for me. I failed almost every subject, except English and computer. Even English wasn’t strong — I could understand a little, but not deeply.
Over time, with effort, I slowly improved. In Class 8, I managed to get 3.65 GPA (A+), which was a huge moment for me. It was my first major academic success. My father was genuinely proud and even bought me a gear cycle he had promised. That moment made me very happy, and I think from there, expectations — from my family and from myself — slowly started increasing.
Later, in Class 10, I got 3.5 GPA. I wasn’t a school topper, but it was my personal-best GPA and also the highest GPA in my family. Because of that, everyone became hopeful that I would continue doing even better in the future.
I chose science in Class 11 because I genuinely wanted to study it, not just because of pressure. But Class 11 has been much harder than I expected. I failed math and chemistry in the first term, and weekly tests also haven’t gone well.
One major problem I face is language. It’s not just English as a subject — it’s the English used in physics and chemistry. The questions are written in long, complex, technical English. Many times, I feel like I don’t fail because I don’t know the concept, but because I don’t fully understand what the question is asking. I read questions multiple times and still feel confused by the wording. It feels like I’m fighting the language more than the subject itself.
Even English as a subject now feels very difficult. The questions are long, the vocabulary is advanced, and I struggle to understand what is expected in answers.
When I sit down to study, I try seriously, but my mind doesn’t cooperate. I don’t study effectively, and then I feel guilty for wasting time. I know my father is doing his job, my parents are spending money on my education, and my college is also trying. That makes me feel worse, like I’m the weak link.
I don’t think my parents are bad people — they believe in me and want me to succeed. But constant focus on results, A+, and not wasting time makes me anxious instead of motivated.
I don’t want to quit suddenly, and I don’t want to disappoint my family. I just want to understand:
Is this kind of struggle common for students from Nepali-medium backgrounds?
How can someone improve science English (physics/chemistry question understanding)?
Did anyone struggle badly in Class 11 but recover later?
What actually helped — study methods, mindset changes, or getting support?
I’m not looking for sympathy. I’m looking for real advice from people who’ve been through something similar.
Thanks for reading."
1prkuz5,Telling my therapist I think I’m depressed when we only focus on my OCD.,Advice,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"TW, SOME minor mentions of self harm and suicide (not much at all)

so for context i’m diagnosed with ocd, misophonia, and misokinesia

my school teacher knows im (passive) suicidal with no intent to act on my thoughts, but i self harmed due to the ocd, misophonia, misokinesia, AND other things which were basically all of symptoms of depression

i have a psychologist and i go to her for the misophonia ocd stuff, and on our first session, my parents were present. she asked me questions all of which i answered honestly EXCEPT when she brought up some depression traits; eg she asked me ”do you feel guilty, hopeless, helpless, sad, like a bad person, hate yourself” and i said no for each one being conscious of my parents’ presence.

my parents are aware i self harmed but not that i was suicidal, as my school didnt feel the need to share that with them.

my parents could and would potentially be dissapointed, upset, hurt, and perhaps even angry if they found out i was suicidal or depressed.

how do i bring this up with the psychologist, who’s ONLY focusing on ocd + miso??

because i feel like if there’s something undiagnosed that could be bad too lol, but also i don’t think she’ll ask because we only focus on ocd, misophonia, and misokinesia

thankss"
1prgt94,"My friend (16M) just asked me out, and I (16F) don't know if i want to date him",Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Hi! My close friend, g for short, asked me out to lunch with him recently, and his best friend (who I'm also very close with) has been talking to me about how g has liked me for around 6 months, perhaps longer. Me and g have only been on speaking terms and have formed a personal relationship from those 6 months ago too. Now, i told our mutual friend that I wasn't sure that asking him out was what I wanted, and i'm still not sure.

He makes me feel safe, and i feel a freedom to be myself around him. We have a teasing sort of relationship, mainly just bickering etc, but i've noticed he just smiles at me and it's mostly me being competative. The reason I mention this though is because my former crush and I had a similar relationship, and maybe I thought this could be a sign I could like him. But, I don't know. Sometimes i can picture myself with him, but sometimes the thought disgusts me a bit. I really don't think I'm physically attracted to him, but maybe this could be something i could learn to be after some time?

He makes me laugh, and I find myself wanting to be in his company, but I really can't tell if thats in a platonic way or a romantic way.

Another thing that slightly is stressing me out about this is that me, g, our mutual close friend, and around 10 of our other mutual friends are in a scouting group together. I'm just considered that if i take the time to go on a date with him and I decide that I don't want to purse a relationship with him, my relationship with our mutual best friend and the rest of the group would be impacted. Our mutual close friend and I used to have feelings for eachother, and he was someone which I know I was both emotionally and physically attracted to, which has been a reference point for me on this situaiton with g too. I do feel guilty about that though, as even though me and my former crush are now completely platonic close friends, I'm using g's best friend as a base for my type. What can one do though I suppose.

Another factor is that I'm 16, and I really do want to be in a relationship. But, I'm also concerned I don't have the time to dedicate myself fully to someone, as I'm very acadmically inclined and have been accelerating into multiple classes/courses that have been challenging me. Maybe thats just an excuse i tell myself to justify myself when I decide i don't want to date him.

I am worried though that no one else would want to date me aside from him, and maybe I should just to experience it. I'm sure i could grow into really liking him through that. But, I know that that's defintaly not the right thing a person should be thinking if they like someone.

Anyway, I don't know what to do! The good thing is I'm currently on a month long holiday, and I don't see g for about 3 weeks so I have time. I'm sorry if this is kind of long too, I'm quite prone to overthinking lmao. Thank you!!"
1pppktc,i dont even wanna live in this world anymore.,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"im 16m, im autsitic, im a bit strange, i have a slightly different norms and hobbies and interests to other people, because of this people bully me, women are scared of me cuz im a larger (tall) man, and people take advantage of the fact im autistic for their own personal amusement. im fucking sick of being prejudiced for just being a man, ive been falsely accused of SA, as i said, women get scared of me for no apparent reason, i get no fucking support, ive been groomed more times by women than men and yet because im a man i have to stand to these shitty social norms of being tough and having no emotion whilst their are people hunting me down.

i also just feel fucking shit everyday, and fuck me idk why. i use to have problems :it made sense for me to be depressed a few years ago, i was being bullied to fucking suicide, loved ones around me were dying, i was lonely with no one there for me and dealing with things like being SA'd, groomed and beaten up and constantly getting into fights and trouble at school. 

But now, all thats in the past, but i feel so shit and depressed still, i still feel crap everyday even though thats all blown over and i really dont understand why, the only things still with me is my fear of people around me (for reasons above), feeling relatively lonely and isolated and also pressure from school but other than that, theres nothing bad that i can recognise (other than my detrimental fear of the future) thats causing me to feel like this

and then also my parents, my mum, i love my mum, idk what i'd do if my parents died, but omfg, my mum fuels my hate for myself. i hate myself, i hate how i look, how i feel, my personality, i hate the fact i feel so guilty, i hate the fact im always fucking hungry and then get guilty over eating then get guilty over not eating and feel shit both ways, then she goes and has a go at me, claims shes not having a go at me, then has a go at me for saying she was having a go at me when she claims she wasnt having a go at me, says stuff that fuels my hate for myself e.g. ""you're so annoy... you're so pessimistic.. etc etc etc"", has a right fucking go at me when i SH and doesnt say anything to help me, she's indenial about my mental disorders, refuses me to go to the doctors and get proper diagnoses for problems like anxiety (which has been diagnosed by councillors but they cant do much other than give ""techniques""). my mum also always victimisies herself, someone else is always in the wrong its never her fault, shes always the damsel in distress, shes all weak and nothings her fault, its all me me me.

1ppcsro,Feeling foolish lately,Serious,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"This probably sounds like a joke post, but it's not.

You could say it all started this morning just because I didn't say good morning to my dad (I forget to say it often, but it's not because I'm mean; it's just that I wake up almost on autopilot in the mornings and in a really bad mood). He gets really angry and yells at me. I'm actually used to being yelled at, but what really bothered me was that he then started complaining to my mom. I didn't hear everything very well, but he was saying things like I ask for too much and that I'm spoiled, a brat and things like that. (I think you should know that I hardly ever ask for things; in fact, my mom makes me ask for things so she can get back at him because he spended money on my grandma, and when I actually do ask, I feel guilty.) I don't know why, but I went to my room and suddenly I started having a meltdown because my parents are always like this. They've really made it clear that I'm a useless, brainless idiot to them (my mom actually got mad at me for something i cannot remember, and said that again to me lmfao) and I've been overthinking all day. I feel like my existence is solely about pleasing people, but I'm never enough for anyone because I can never live up to their expectations. It doesn't matter if I'm one of the best students in my class, if I'm a good person, if I try hard to be a better daughter, I'm never enough because I can't be the idealized version of me that someone has of me. 

I realized this post is getting  long, so I'd like to know if it's normal to feel this way about things like this, or if I'm overreacting and there's something wrong with me idk.

(And i hope i used the correct flair)"

1pohvjt,I have a crush on my boy bsf but he had a girlfriend,Discussion,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I feel so guilty even writing this, but I can’t help how I feel. I’m an 18-year-old girl, and my boy best friend is an 18-year-old guy. Here’s the story.

Over the past year, I lost a lot of friends. I distanced myself from a toxic community and found a much healthier friend group just in time for senior year. There are five of us: Unicorn, Silksong, Zenyatta, Dexter, and me. Unicorn and Zenyatta have always been best friends, and so have Silksong and Dexter. Unicorn and Silksong have been dating for two years, so their groups merged. I became close to Zenyatta first, then Unicorn, who I now consider my best friend. Because Dexter works a lot, it’s usually just the four of us.

I wasn’t close to Dexter at first, but he had a girlfriend who treated him terribly. We all hated how she treated him, and eventually she cheated and they broke up. That’s when I first realized I liked him. I never acted on it, partly because I was scared of his ex, and I ended up dating someone else. While I had a boyfriend, Dexter started talking to another girl.

One night during a group movie night, I accidentally got way too high and felt really sick. Dexter teased me but then drove me home. That’s when I realized my crush never actually went away. It was never strong enough to confess, but it was always there.

Right before school started, my boyfriend and I broke up. There was about a two-week gap where Dexter and I were both single, and I thought about him a lot — but then he made things official with the girl he’d been talking to. I told myself my feelings had to stop, and for a while, they did.

Then senior year started, and we ended up in the same math class. We both sucked at math and bonded over that. At first, we didn’t talk much, but once seating changed and we sat next to each other, we got really close. We started texting every day, fake arguing, laughing nonstop in class. It got flirty, and people noticed.

In October, we went to a friend’s party, and he drove me home late. I was exhausted and laid down in his backseat. The silence was full of tension. When he pulled up, he asked if I was asleep, and we just smiled at each other before I said goodnight. It was small, but it stuck with me.

Since then, we’ve only gotten closer — more touchy, more giggly, more obvious. Our friends have pointed it out, and my feelings have gotten worse. I can’t stop thinking about it, and I feel awful because he has a girlfriend.

She’s nice, but I don’t think she’s a great girlfriend. Before dating Dexter, she talked to multiple guys at once while dating someone else. During their relationship, Dexter stopped hanging out with us and barely texts anyone. They almost broke up after she said another guy was better than him. Dexter has never really known what a healthy relationship looks like, and I honestly think he deserves better.

I know how bad this sounds. I would never confess or act on it — I don’t want to be a homewrecker. I just needed to get this off my chest, and I really need advice.

Please help me.

my dad died in his sleep today and it just feels so fake like it doesn’t feel real. I’m only 17. The fact that my dad won’t be here for my grad or anything like that is really hurting me right now. he was perfectly fine yesterday. Everything was great. I don’t know what happened.

I feel a little guilty because I walked upstairs to get a drink at around six in the morning and I had no idea that my dad had passed away on the couch and I don’t know if I would’ve saw him, I could’ve done something but it was the one time I didn’t turn on the lights to get a drink and I would like to think that it was somehow him subconsciously telling me not to turn on the lights so I wouldn’t have to be the one to find him, but I just don’t know how to process or deal with any of this at the moment. So if anyone has any kind words or tips to help. It would be really appreciated.

I’m a college student, and this year has been… a lot.
Sometimes I feel like I'm living five lives at once. On the outside I look like a normal student going to classes, hanging out with friends, trying to joke around so people don’t ask too many questions. But inside, it’s messy in a way I rarely admit out loud.
My family has been through more loss and stress than people my age usually deal with. I lost my older sister in 2019, and even though years have passed, the grief never disappears — it just hides differently. My dad's health and finances are things I worry about constantly, even when I'm supposed to be studying or being a “normal” teenager. I sometimes feel guilty for wanting to be young and carefree when life hasn’t really allowed that.
College is its own battlefield. I made new friends, but I still feel left out at times — like I’m present physically but not really part of the moment. I help people, I show up for them, but I rarely let anyone see how overwhelmed I am. And yeah, relationships have been messy too. Love, mistakes, trust, heartbreak — the full chaotic package. I’m learning more about myself through it, but it's not easy.
Sometimes I just want someone to say, “Hey, you’re doing fine. You’re trying your best.”
Because honestly, I am trying.
I show up. I study. I take care of my family. I carry memories and responsibilities bigger than my age. And even on the days I feel like breaking down, I still push myself to keep going.
I don’t know why I’m posting this. Maybe I just needed a space where I could finally say:

1pivrur,I don't know what to do anymore.,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"(TW: self-harm, abuse (?))

So, I got ill with depression this year at the start of school and it has been horrible. Nothing seems to get better. I've been begging my mom to help me (by help I mean getting me a therapist or a psychiatrist) but she refuses. Instead she forces me to take anti-stress pills, which do make me feel more positive, but I also noticed that ever since I've started taking them they've made me feel extremely apathetic. I hate it so much. Most times I wish I could cry but I always feel physically unable to. Talking to my mother is pointless. She tells me that 'i read too much on the internet' and blames all my online friends who are probably the only reason that I've never committed yet. She also constantly tells me that this is just a normal teenager thing and its just my hormones. I don't know, not all teenagers walk around feeling miserable about everything and being afraid and paranoid of being called out as a fraud, or do they? Maybe she's right. I really don't know.

I really love my mother, but I just really wish she actually listened and tried to help me. She always makes me feel extremely guilty for being trans, for being depressed and for even questioning myself and trying to find labels and terms that make it easier for me to accept my inabilities and 'weirdness'.

These constant feelings and everything that's going on has made me develop some very machosistic and self-harmous tendencies (cutting, extensive skin picking and purposely making my cats scratch me) which give me a sense of relief and non-se^ual pleasure. I had suicidal plans but I've just been feeling so so horrible that I won't commit on them. I just want something horrible to happen that wouldnt kill me, but would permanently make me ill or hurt.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I know this whole thing is all over the place but I don' know how to lay out my words differently because it' just all so tiring. 

Please tell me if I'm overreacting and this is really just a 'teenage hormonal phase.'"

For context, we broke up in the end of February, but we kept talking pretty consistently (with periods of no talking) and she even lived with me for a few weeks because she ran away. We were together for about 3 years on and off, and doing long distance (she lives on the other side of the country). I don’t really like to mention it, because I know it’s not her fault, but she does have bipolar and it did really affect our relationship. I can admit I was also a bit toxic, for the reason that I’m trans and I have a lot of insecurities that affected our relationship. Anyways, a few nights ago, she called me from an unknown caller ID, and I declined the first 15 but she kept calling and so I just picked up. I didn’t say anything, I just sat there silent while she was hysterically crying and drunk, saying how much she misses me and needs me and how sorry she is for everything she did to me. The call ended up hanging up for some reason, but then she called me back and I answered again. I don’t know why, I just started feeling so sad and I wanted to hear what she had to say. We ended up talking for an hour, and it honestly just felt like a dream. It was really weird. The next night, we weren’t supposed to text but then we just got caught up in a conversation, and then it got deeper and we just sort of got caught up and I think felt comfort in each other. But afterwards, we agreed to not talk, but she said if either of us see a pink car we should send a pic and that’s how we’ll start a conversation again. I wasn’t really sure if it was a good idea but I was just kind of in the moment. Anyway, she already saw a pink car and texted me today. This was my response. Was that messed up of me to say?

1piif0b,My friend is so obsessed with his ex to the point he’s stalking her - what should I do??,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"A friend of mine needs professional help. My friend got broken up with by a girl a while ago, initially she said “he deserved someone better” &amp; that she “wasnt in the right place for a relationship” - obviously this sucked for him. However, recently he found out she actually broke up with him for her ex so she could back together with him. 

This situation sucks and he has all the right to be upset and angry about this for as long as he needs, but it’s getting out of hand. He’s telling me he can’t go on without her, that he thinks of her every second of every day and cannot move on. I talk to him for hours about this, trying to console him and make him feel even the slightest bit happier, but it’s all in vein. 

I’ve done all I can to help, but it’s getting creepy now. He is practically stalking her. She’s blocked him on all platforms, has verbally said she never wants to talk to him again and won’t let anyone talk to her about him either. He messages her family members, her friends and makes alternate accounts all to get in contact with her. Now, I know what she did was horrible and she SHOULD apologise for what she’s done, but that won’t happen. He begs me almost everyday to check her accounts to see if shes posted anything, remembers and talks about very personal details regarding her that he shouldn’t be thinking or worrying about now. 

I care about my friend but know I can’t help either of them anymore, but I also feel so guilty for not wanting to help him anymore. I have told him
he needs help, should I push this all further and wait until he comes to his senses or should I just leave it and let him figure it all out? I need help."

I decided to intervene. I bought powdered sugar because it looks similar, and I switched his stash when he was out. Now he is using sugar instead of cocaine. He seems calmer and sleeps better. He does not know about the switch. The other roommates laugh and think it is funny.

I don’t wanna break friendships with him cus he’s a genuinely good guy (other than the fact he’s homophobic). should I try to convert him? I feel like I’m enabling homophobia by letting it pass like this as a part of the community"
1pgpdks,My “perfect” friend is actually the WORST and I can’t escape her,Advice,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"I need advice. I have this friend let’s call her A and she’s literally SO exhausting. She’s always negative, judges everything and everyone, and makes everything about herself., complains about tiny stuff, and feels the need to comment on literally everything people do, replies in place of others, like someone could ask me a question and she answers for me even things that have nothing to do with her. it’s like she sees life as a competition or something. 

A friend of mine who used to be her friend likes drawing a little monkey for whatever reason i think it’s like from a show or something, anyway, she keeps saying stuff like “this girl and her fuckass monkey” like why?? Who even cares???

She also loves pointing out flaws in people, criticizing what they like, like that girl who draws, and being annoyed at literally everything. She’s egocentric too she does things that affect multiple people without asking anyone else, then acts like her opinion is objective. 
I just feel like she’s negative to be around and just a bad influence. through she tries to act normal i guess like anyone.

She paints herself as perfect. her family is wealthy, she’s ambitious, her whole family is religious and she wears hijab and prays 5 times a day (maybe not relevant here but makes her seem like an angel to people around me), she’s a straight A student. so you can’t really call her out without feeling guilty. But being around her drains me.

Meanwhile, my other friend, K, is chill, funny, and easy to be around. I love being around her, but A is everywhere in school, she’s in almost all the same classes as i am, extracurriculars, etc, while K is only with me in one class, maths, where we can’t talk at all and all we do is work thanks to my strict teacher. Sometimes I feel like I’m going to explode being around her UGH.

I want to keep A as an acquaintance level friend, without letting her take over my brain, and spend my energy on B and other people I actually like. But I don’t want drama, and I feel guilty for being annoyed all the time.

The thing is, K, likes her, she isn’t bothered by A tbh it’s annoying, but i think it’s because she’s not as exposed to her as i am. 

Right now, i’m trying to talk to other people who she kind of distanced me from last year but i like.
Something about her talking bad about one of her friends other friends and they all dropped her, but they still interact like not completely ignoring each other or anything.

IDK WHAT TO DO AND IDK WHAT I AM DOING.

i have two years left of school i don’t want them to be full of more suffering than that i will go through during a levels

Also, tbh on a surface level A is not a bad friend to have she’s a nerd basically so that may help this year and next year if we take anything in common, but yea i’m not sure."
1pgpbil,How Can I Convince My Strict Parents To Get a PC,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Okay so I'm 14 (M) coming from an Arab household and really want a PC. I have a Mac that I use for both school and gaming, but honestly it hardly runs any good games. These are the main reasons I want a PC:

1. **Better performance for school and gaming** \- My mac struggles with running basic games. Also I'm starting to notice that it's getting slower by time as I play more games on it.
2. **Gaming with friends** \- Many of my friends are getting PC's and many of them already have PC's, I honestly feel left because I wouldn't be able to play games with them.
3. **Animation** \- I also do animation and video editing as a hobby, but the softwares I use (After Effects &amp; Photoshop) needs a decent PC to run smoothly. My mac barely runs After Effects alone let alone Photoshop.

I cant build up the courage to ask my parents to get one, whenever I ask them for something they take it as a joke, they feel like I can't take my own responsibility. I once asked my dad for a PC, he took it as a joke, didn't even give a genuine thought about it, and said I would be addicted and play games all day long.

But I have something I'm guilty towards, I honestly play on my laptop a lot and use my phone a lot, and my grades are pretty average. I know this is probably the reason my parents hesitate to get me a PC.

That said, I really want to use a PC responsibly. I feel like if I can hold up a good argument they could be leaning to get me one.

By the way, they have no problem with paying for it, it's more about what i'm gonna do with the PC

So I'm asking for advice: what arguments/strategies could I use to convince my parents that I'll use the PC responsibly.

I know It won't happen in a week or maybe even a month. But honestly I just really want the PC before Grade 9 ends. (My birthday is also in March)

I just really want a chance to prove that I can handle it and be responsible.

1pg4crb,This quote pisses me off because,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"You might wanna think for a second before you go along and say that everything is ""relative"" and that your problems don't matter because ""other people"" have more serious problems than you. Wait, I think we just get to invalidate everyone else's problems too! By that premise, no one should ever feel tired, worn out, or stressed; after all, there's always a person out there who's wishing they had those issues! It seems ridiculous and it comes off very condescending if you ask me!

People require space in order to feel what they are feeling and not be made to feel guilty for having ""bad days."" A chaotic day is permitted to be chaotic. A hard day is permitted to be hard. When you are acting like everything in your life is going smoothly, all you're doing is deceiving other people into believing that you are someone you're not; I don't know about you, but I don't consider myself a better person because of someone else's words on a wall.

I'm awkward in social conversations I don't have much experience with the outside world. I have no hobbies I spend my days mindlessly scrolling social media. I was raised by a single mother who is an immigrant she works 50-hour workweeks at a factory despite being 55 I feel guilty for not helping her but I don't know how to reform my life 

My true goal is to become an author I was a heavy reader when I was a child however I stopped at around 13 I've started reading more books as well as rebuilding my grammar and spelling. I sincerely wish I could change could be this person who's in shape and attractive who's can talk to people and form bonds who is a successful author who can become independent and be a functional adult. I see no path where I can be an independent adult. I've tried to get my license however I  damaged a car at the driver's school I went to they told me to practice before I come back. However, with my mom's work hours, it's hard to find time for her to let me practice in her car. I can't get a job since I don't have reliable transportation which means I need to get my license first. The community college I’m attending is close enough to walk but it’s still an hour walk based on commute time. This also means I can’t really go to the gym to help me lose weight. However, the bigger issue is my character I want to change and be productive I have for years but I’m too much of a coward to take the next step it just consumes me and I get anxiety inside of doing anything. I could learn how to cook basic meals and clean the house but I'm too lazy to take the first step yet I’m still unhappy and miserable I suppose it’s because my mother has always done these things for me and I’ve gotten used to it. I just don’t know what steps to take I feel hopeless."

I broke up with my ex about a year ago because i realized i didn’t have romantic feelings for her despite my unconditional platonic love, and she freaked out after a month of “Yeah! Im literally perfectly fine you should totally tell me when you get into another relationship and we can still be besties!” She decided to spread rumors about me and this other girl we were both friends with, who i was close to in a club, and who she was very jealous of during our relationship, and eventually we both had to cut contact with my ex. Ironically, it made me and that friend get very close, we even almost got together, but both mutually decided to wait until my ex calmed because there was a genuine fear of self harm. Eventually, summer came, the friend moved 4 hours away from my college, and she said she couldn’t do long distance (which i understand, her ex literally dumped her for it out of nowhere) But we’ve kept in touch and i thought we still had feelings that were mutual, but all the sudden ive been ghosted for a month out of nowhere literally in the middle of a normal conversation about our schools band. I feel horrible still for my ex and i cant stop thinking about her and how i somehow feel guilty, she had to go to therapy and i feel terrible for my friend because she didn’t deserve to be involved like that. I feel like the only two friends i have outside of my main group are just gone. And it hurts even worse because ive been questioning if im trans (im AMAB) for years, but im in a very conservative community and they - especially my ex - are the only two i could even consider talking to about it.

So, I was just chilling on Reddit (shocker, I know), and someone messaged me ""Hey""  
I responded ""Hello"" and they responded with asking how I was, because they had seen a post I had made about me having an episode

To try and keep this short (or as short as possible), we kept talking, and eventually they found out I was 13M, and I found out they were 18F.

Basically, they were weirdly focused on the topic of masturbation, and, while I would normally block someone, they sent a photo of themselves (which was reverse searched and found no results), and seemed nice. They let me vent about topics I never gotten to vent about (even now, me and them are the only person who knows some of those things), and towards the end, they asked if I wanted to masturbate with them. When I said no, they deleted their account.

Now, I spotted some red flags such as: they called me ""honey"" a lot, but I assumed they were just baby-ing me, as I was younger (and I didn't mind, as I'm willing to pay that price if it means getting help), they also talked a lot about how ""they went on reddit to talk spicy DMs with guys"" and stuff, and were so persistent in talking about if I masturbate, and, after I explained some mental issues with it, including trauma (i was exposed to pornographic material in 3rd grade), she said she'd ""help me enjoy it""

She kept talking about how she ""goes on reddit to have spicy DMs with guys"" and other things of similar nature, I know those are GIANT fucking red flags but I didn't want to make assumptions and lose the one person I could vent to about those things.

Now, I need some help here, I don't know what to do right now, nor how to feel.  
I feel so bad and guilty, they let me vent about things I had never talked about, and they kept the convo either on the topic of ""gooning"", or how I was and my mental health. I feel so bad for saying no, I feel like I owe them something. (I know that's illogical, I'm sorry).  
I don't know what to call this conversation, or if I should feel angry or smth.

1p97xy1,"17m having unwanted feelings toward younger girls, need help please",Serious,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Hi, I’m 17 and I’ve been struggling with something I don’t understand, and it’s ruining my life. I’ve been having intense feelings toward younger girls (around 12 yrs old) that I don’t want, and it’s confusing me. I’m not talking about someone I know personally, it’s usually a character from a movie or tv show. But the feelings are persistent.

I notice myself fixating on the faces, gestures, body shape, mannerisms, and energy of younger teens. Sometimes it’s romantic, sometimes it feels aesthetic, sometimes it even feels sexual, or at least I think so. I feel ashamed, and I don’t want to feel this way.

I do also like girls my age, sometimes even older, and I’ve had countless age-appropriate crushes. But I also have these younger crushes, so far I can think of three.

It started when I was around 15-16, and I’ve noticed it repeatedly. It’s been present in my mind for different people in this age group. It’s intense and feels permanent, and it causes me a lot of anxiety and shame. I’ve tried redirecting my thoughts, but the feelings don’t go away. And the weird thing is that sometimes my mind is like “obviously I’m not attracted to kids, it’s just an ‘aww cute kid’ feeling”, and sometimes it’s like “yeah this is a crush”. And I cannot for the love of god figure out which one it is.

And these feelings, they usually feel more like when you see your crush and think “wow they’re so beautiful, I wanna kiss them”, rather than “wow they’re so hot I wanna have s*x with them”. But yeah, I don’t know.

I also think it’s worth mentioning that I don’t have any friends, I’ve been completely socially isolated since I was like 14. I don’t know, maybe that could be the cause? Lack of social development or something? Or could it be because of overuse of social media, or porn, or both?

I want to be completely incapable of feeling these thoughts toward anyone inappropriate, permanently. I don’t want them at all. I’ve read that attraction to minors is something people are “born with” and unchangeable, and that terrifies me. I don’t want to be a pedophile, I don’t want these thoughts, but I don’t know how to stop feeling them.

I don’t know if this could be OCD, POCD, neurodivergence, overexposure to media, or just a developmental thing. Cause it seems like a neurodivergent person might have this exact problem of just thinking kids are “cute” in an innocent way and then mistaking it for attraction. I’m worried this will never go away. I want help, guidance, or resources, professional advice, studies, therapy approaches, just anything that could help.

I also feel like my life is consumed by these thoughts sometimes. I try to distract myself, but my mind keeps returning to them, and it’s exhausting. I feel like I can’t escape them, and I feel guilty and scared constantly.

I’m asking here because I don’t have anyone to talk to, and I don’t want to hurt anyone or myself. I just want to understand what’s happening and find a way to make it stop safely and permanently.

TL;DR: I’m 17 and I have recurring romantic/aesthetic/sexual feelings toward younger girls that I don’t want and I feel ashamed of. I need professional guidance and safe resources to permanently stop these thoughts and be normal cause this is ruining my life."

1pbx3uk,Should I move out for college or stay home?,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Hiii! I'm seventeen and starting college next fall. I was recently looking at apartments near the college I'm going to, and I found one specifically for students in the area. There are 1-6 bedrooms for each apartment for roommates and an apartment with 4 bedrooms is $400-500/month. This is huge for me, and I could most definitely afford it with or without a part time job. 

I'm indigenous and when I enroll to college, I get $1k per month + $16k when I turn eighteen from my reservation.  This, with a part time job, I'd be getting around $2500/month.

 I have everything I need to actually move out, but I just feel so guilty leaving my family and especially my dog since she has seperation anxiety. My mom says I already have a home and that I shouldn't really think about moving out, but she also wants me to pay rent in our house soon, which I don't really feel comfortable doing. I don't want to pay rent in a place where I don't get any freedom or privacy anyways. What should I do?"

If u saw this same post and responded to it thank you for anything and everything i really do appreciate you for even being there - CPS is not an option, they have been called 3 years ago by the dad he never told me what he said or what happened but they never ever came, I’m homeschooled, i can try a counselor or a principal but i really do not want what happened with the police they don’t help but ridicule me. And the therapist who did not believe me or care. I feel really sad. I want to be a kid i want to be happy, i just don’t understand how anyone can do this, you never want to talk to me or be in my life but bring and spend everyday with your girlfriends family and thanksgiving!?? it’s thanksgiving day but the dad and his girlfriend all are over the aunts house, with his daughter and the girlfriend and of all of the extended family who are supposed to be family but they aren’t and the other brother told them everything and spoke to them about everything thats included of this post. Of self h, the hospital, everything. everything. But they didn’t do anything and they are all over there, and accept it all saying “i thought you all were together made up.” he said that they didnt know talking to the mother…. But this was way before today, they know. Last year when it was my birthday they went insulting me, of my hair,” yeah get that mess together.” everything, i couldn’t even make a wish, without getting told “hurry up what is she waiting for whats wrong with her?” It was thanksgiving last year on the day of thats the only reason there was a cake. After i ate my food they already ate theirs fast they waited until i was done with my plate and told me to throw their dishes -paper plates.. away. Nobody wanted to talk to me and made fun of me with weird looks and gross tone changes, I feel awful for even posting this and i had such an urge to delete it. He said hes going to go over there and go handle it. But i don’t think he will.. I just feel i don’t know. I just feel so numb i do not want to become like them or that in general. 

I really dont know what to do, i , because this is just “normal” to me this is all I’ve ever known it really just gets worse and worse, sending pictures and saying and pretending everyone is happy and  its more of a “well we’re happier than you, boohoo you could be right here eating with us but u decide not to.” Of thanksgiving dinners and ask everyone else “ why is -name- not here?” I don’t know if it is betrayal or what because its never, i never had them there for me, as a young child, preteen everything, it was always me alone, and them burning so much hatred onto me?? Sending photos of her daughters homecoming which they all did a huge celebration of with balloons, dress, even in front of her house the “grandmothers” home, all just photos constantly and i didn’t come but they spammed it to me in groupchats alot that day. And even brought a singular smushed cupcake and saying “oh you dont want it?” I don’t want to do anything for my birthday i just want to be happy, it’s gotten to a point i just want more people to hurt me because thats all i got from this. just more and more of it and more of it. I’ve never had anyone especially them ever say I’m proud of you. It had made me feel so happy and bizarre that when i went to the doctor and they said it.

The girlfriend herself isn’t an option she had even kicked the other brother out from him trying to spend time with the dad and talking to him, listening to the conversation and then getting upset, as they went to the car. So upset till one day she went and texted them both that they need to go and pack all their s out of her fing house.” and if you even said a word to her about the time and months her message would go to 3 months to 2 weeks. he tried to tell her, i tried to talk to her and she told me she was so deeply disappointed in me when the only time i was there in her guest room that i stayed in a night watching tv, with him fondling himself under the same bedsheets that i would sleep in. And then he went “oh you don’t want to talk to me, you use to, what happened.” He even tried to get closer to me when i slightly moved not even knowing that he knew that i did. I told her everything of him, she hated that. Which she didn’t even text or say anything to me back she just told everyone else and then i was told when they flock together, saying “she’s so deeply disappointed in you, she shes all these things that I your dad does for you and shes so upset in you.” More in the text.. it was so bad to the point when i couldn’t take it anymore over there before those messages… touching himself made me sick and i slept on top of the covers  with my jacket covering me as a blanket when i slept that day. that i just had to go back to the place i absolutely did not want to go back to. She went “i told you so “ and laughing so happy with malicious intent.  And he was furious that i wanted to leave, its when the cops were called when she came over there to come and take me even with her car being messed up and saying “No,no you made your choice, this is your choice nobody hurts u or does anything to u.” Berating me, keeping the soap he bought, some of my clothes. And i never got them back.  And him making lies and being overly compassionate, while his girlfriend just listened, I was terrified to say what i truly wanted to say. It was dead silent. He didn’t send me food for months simply because i wasn’t talking to him and when you talk and say they did no wrong, you get food. And when i went and got food for myself when i walked. I had to sneak out. yelling hollering over the phone absolutely hammered yelling “ YOU BETTER BE GLAD I DONT COME OVER THERE AND FLIP OUT.” how can you do that when your so intoxicated drinking all your girlfriends liquor over the phone. Who knows how much he drunk but it got to a problem when the other brother was there she came to him and showing bottles and bottles and then so upset he told her and her family when they come to him asking more information because he would never tell them anything. About him as a person, anything. Then when the text happened of me expressing what happened she made up with the dad? Saying “she was the person who saw me cry, and how i do so much for you, and theres tons of people who have it worst who have great lives.” And then saying the other brother has to get out and  the gf had said that the dad could stay and then he said , “oh well, you can go somewhere else.” When he himself didn’t know when she had sent it. And of saying he would get a hotel and he didn’t want to move back in with the grandmother or his sisters. And they didn’t want him to be there either. I just dont know… i really don’t know its so disturbing to me. 

This was back earlier this year.

https://imgur.com/gallery/GHiCtrY

Im tired, these photos took place last year and some early this year when i was 15 im 16 now about to turn 17 what a great nearing birthday… of what i can remember, She had been banging of the door yelling berates and of ARE YOU SURE YOUR IN THAT SHOWER, Laughing and banging to leaving the door to coming back and doing this over and over and over again… even getting a knife screwing off the door knob and trying to remove the door knob completely. Which a few times she would come and say as a threat, you better be glad I DONT COME IN THERE AND THEN WASH YOU MYSELF, IM YOUR PARENT I CAN DO THAT. Then going silent and trying more while after also throwing every thing she could say to me of i was dirty, don’t clean the room, “somebody” is crazy, who did this to you, somebody is nuts- referring to me. I took the photo sitting on the toilet, she had also tried to take the doorknob off the other door and would watch me, through the slit a big enough hole u could see me naked trying to make “sure of i was in the shower.” Hollering and yelling she would constantly berate me and tell me i was a filthy dirty girl and go in extensive detail of private parts, and how I’m not like her and how she wants me to be.  and would laugh about this she would constantly repeat it over and over again it got to the point where i had to put a shirt that i took off my clothes to shower to block her point of view. And she would yell DONT BLOCK NOTHING OF THIS DOOR, dirty girl and then laughing more. And stick her finger through and knock the shirt off. I don’t remember what i felt i just tried to speed and i remember my head going blank. But hopelessness. The cabinet and refrigerator pictures were how it was for months apart when i even took the picture in my storage it says this was from early march and to then of the last picture that i did of it was of mid may. She would never want to buy food for anyone but herself and the food she bought was foul, junk, and she would eat it all and then taunt saying “ oh do you want some of these cookies…?? Are you sure?? Are you sure??? They are very good. And she would even shove them by your face when you said no while being near her in the vicinity and laughing. She always had so much malice and hatred in her voice and face at times you could see it, and then condition herself heavily of the public but then slip up. Whenever you asked her for food it would be oh i cant get that because you don’t need that. Go eat something down there there’s food down there. Or of a fit of rage and yelling WHY DO YOU ACT LIKE THAT WHATS WRONG WITH YOU WHOSE CHILDREN ARE YOU, BECAUSE MINE DONT ACT LIKE THAT, DO YOU HEAR SOMEBODY SPEAKING TO YOU OR SOMETHING, I DONT ACT LIKE THAT IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM YOU CAN FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO LIVE. Then of yelling of somebody must be “rtarded.” Did you not hear what i said. Dirty girl. This is only some of the things she would say. And when she did work more and have money for food she would instead buy her self an adult toy make it known but then getting mad “WHO SAID YOU AND THIS IS MY BUSINESS AND NO THATS NOT WHAT I DID, THIS IS MY MONEY I WORKED FOR I CAN BUY WHAT I LIKE AND ITS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.” I remember a bit when she was arguing with the brother downstairs yelling, i was so irritated and hungry she would purposely leave it out… (this would happen random days multiple times and especially sometimes during the day or morning.) and when she could’ve bought food she had bought a 50 dollar toy with something else…. She would then leave it around in the open with the nearest outlet visible on the floor right when you walk in it was there. Knowing she had a different outlet in the back that noone can see thats covered by her bed. But she chose that one. Multiple times. On a charger. 

The third picture of the red markings, was when she had used my belt on me from the closet and said of i think “ I’m going to tear your - up. and then it just went into a bunch of screaming and yelling from me crying and of her yelling. i don’t remember really any of it deeper than this but i remember then sitting of the bed and crying. And of lashes of the inside of my thighs while she was on top of me and she was in between my legs. My thighs dont get red or bruise easily… I remember the police were called that day as well they didnt do a thing just laughed at me trying to explain every piece that they would do something please just do something and then of saying it’s discipline and of how she went of how i called her a bad word. And halfway in they thought this was stupid and just left. And how after this she would tell everyone of how i pushed her up against the wall? and how i fought her and how awful i was. I was 109 lbs 5,7 she was around 160 lbs same height, i didn’t have anything to eat unless i begged the absent father to order some food for me. And the food in there was supposed to be shared among 4 people. 3 adults and me. He- Who would then of berate me and saying “ What y’all don’t have no food over there. Why do you keep telling me theres no food.” There were tons of it he would say or simply hung up because he  wanted to talk to his girlfriend and didn’t want them to know or hear any of that. I would then feel guilty about asking about it all, and didn’t want to have to ask for food to eat anymore. gained a ed i didn’t even know what that was, but i thought i would be way better and happier that way or people would see even more and come help… i had also showed him the marks he said “Girl bye, thats nothing those are baby marks; i would do way worse if you ever—-“ it was something to that extent he said i remember that was his favorite line to say as well as completely ignoring me, while berating me in private, playing with the girlfriends daughter the 1 year younger than me, while they insult me and say “ whats wrong with you why you so quiet YEA GO BACK TO SLEEP.” I remember they said to me one road trip. And would constantly use it. Like i was a neglected dog “oh slimjim? Oh slimjim? All you want is s-s-s-slimjim?” Saying “thats all she says.”…. And laughing It was Down to their family house and then one of to his family. And i remember the only time he would “spend time” just screenlocked scrolling media for hours mirroring the girlfriend’s daughter i guess because he didn’t want to talk about it? Or anything.” They would just stare at me with weird back and forth peaks, and of Saturdays, unless they were missed for some reason? I didn’t see him at all for 6 months from what happened at the hospital in January to of august or September this year.. And the only communication was of him sending tiktoks.. of “Wash your a ss.” And degrading foul things, copy and pasted texts over and over from weeks in between them. While knowing i had no soap, at the time. And ag the times i do need stuff i have to walk to the store, the last time i did walk and that she knew, she went and of coming down yelling then i had left but when i came back she was yelling saying the same GO TAKE A SHOWER NOW and she was smiling just smiling and laughing and closed the door behind me. To constantly yelling it.

 this was of what had happened yesterday—-  i jot everything i possibly, can as soon as anything happens. Or if i just want to take note of anything that i like or in general

I feel so disturbed to know that the people who could’ve  help but did nothing or does the same exact thing, while hiding beneath a badge. Ive had my experiences with cops constantly being called here back and forth and of the dad’s girlfriends house not a single thing, nobody helped. the cops that time were a little better than the cops here for some reason? But it was still the same “oh she doesn’t want to talk.” “Oh she wants to speak with my partner then i guess.” I was so afraid and thats the first thing you say. And earlier that day or when i was over there the father went “ do something with yourself look presentable, and then of saying fix that wig.” My own hair… i tried my best. and that same day of saying or before them arguing of the phone and saying shes going to stay right here with me. I was unable to leave and saying of “ WHAT SHES MAKING U DO THIS, NO NO YOUR STAYING RIGHT HERE WITH ME. IM NOT DOING NOTHING TO YOU, NOW YOU HAVE THIS CHILD BEING GUILTY.” To gaslighting me with his girlfriend. “ what you feel like nobody care about you; they do, you need to SPEAK to them, how do you expect people to like you if you dont talk.” saying  Something of that and then saying well i don’t expect for them to do that, to come and talk.  I had already been there more than 48 hours. I know this is very scrambled but its what i can remember off the top of my head. "

1p47c2w,I have a favorite house and I feel guilty about it,Discussion,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),I’m a child of divorce and I used to primarily be at my moms except occasionally going to my dad for Friday’s or weekends. Now we are on the week schedule and after only a week being there I like being there more. It’s better. I love my pets here and if it weren’t for my pets I’d probably want to stay there forever. This house doesn’t feel like home and this room doesn’t feel like mine. Anyways that’s all. What are your divorced child experiences? Do you have a favorite house?
1p5a995,Last few days as a teenager.,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Hi, people :)
I’m 19F, turning 20 in December; I’m feeling quite sad about it because I’ve never liked getting older, so I thought I could use this space to share some things I have learned through my teens.
I’m also open to any questions, if there’s any.

(Btw, sorry if my English is not perfect, I’m not a native speaker)


So, in the last 2 years I have realised how much I’ve lost of my teenage years because of my mental health. I wish I could have done so much more, experience so much more, and enjoy that piece of youth during my teenage life.  I was forced to grow up very fast, never quite had the chance to transition from childhood - teens - adulthood, it was more of a sudden jump between being a kid and then becoming an adult. I encourage you to embrace that transition and that stage as much as possible. 
Embrace the awkwardness and the self discovery, and stick to whatever makes you YOU! Don’t lose your essence for the sake of plain maturity: If it’s something worth keeping, let it evolve with you, but don’t abandon it because you think it’s something that should be changed with age. 
Please take care of yourself, in whatever ways that means to you; Prioritise yourself while being aware of how that impacts your environment. 
Your mental health is important, look after your emotional and mental sanity, because that will play a big part later on.
If possible, don’t leave school! I made that terrible mistake, it wasn’t something I wanted to do, but I had to, and it fucked me up in so many ways I’m even embarrassed to admit. Please, if that’s in your possibilities; keep studying, keep preparing yourself.
Go out but stay SAFE. Experiment within safe margins, and don’t give into peer pressure. Listen to yourself if you don’t like what you’re hearing, the most valuable, and important advice comes from you in situations like that; listen to your instincts.
Stand up for yourself, protect yourself, and what you represent. No matter the circumstances, your age doesn’t determine your worth, and the fact that you’re a teenager doesn’t mean your opinions, knowledge or abilities are less, or matter less.
Enjoy your teenage years! Don’t force yourself to grow up. It only lasts a few years, make the most of it. 
Don’t stick to people who won’t give you the place you deserve. If they don’t appreciate your presence, they’ll show it, and you will know. Don’t let it pass, it’s not worth it.
Whoever wants you in their lives will make it known one way or another, even through the smallest gestures. This applies to friends, partners, family, and basically anyone.
Don’t let your self esteem keep you from doing what you want to do. I lost many opportunities to that, and I regret deeply.
You are allowed to be in photos, even when you feel your ugliest. Later in life you will want to know how you looked back in the day, you will want to see a photo with someone important, but you won’t have it because you thought you looked too bad to be in it. That happened to me, unfortunately; I lost my dad, and I only have a few photos with him because I was a very self conscious girl, and never got the courage to be comfortable when taking pictures.

And, I cannot stress this enough. Please, take care of yourself. You are so freaking valuable, and you deserve the chance to be cherished for it. Your presence, your opinions, your knowledge, your kindness, your love is irreplaceable. YOU are irreplaceable because you give and provide something special to this world, something that only you can do. 
Don’t let anyone ever make you believe the opposite. You deserve to be happy, and not feel guilty about it.

1p2skod,Do you guys ever feel guilty for your parent’s support?,Rant,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),I live in the west in a state with plenty of resources and a wonderful school and household. I just feel guilty. Like I’m freeloading and getting too much. I can get all the tutoring and therapy I need and even a few years of free college through my high school. I don’t know how to live up to my values with all of these opportunities given to me that I’ve done nothing to deserve. I can’t even land a fucking job.
1p2t75r,My Depression and Drug Problems(Trigger Warning),Serious,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"So in January of this year my dad went to jail for a night for hitting my step-mom. Her nose got broken and she had a black eye. My dad and mom haven’t been together since 2010. However, I didn’t end up going to my dad’s until March because he never reached out. On top of this he has always been emotionally, mentally, and verbally abusive towards me and he was and he never acknowledged that I’m capable of having feelings too. Then the court case opened up which caused him to talk bad about my mom in front of me and when I stood up for her I would get grounded or yelled at. From March to July there was a court case going on which caused even more anxiety. I really struggle with anxiety if you couldn’t tell. Then I went through my first heartbreak/break up in late March, which just added onto the stress, sadness, disappointment, and anxiety that the situation with my dad had already caused. I was running out of reasons to live and I eventually tried to kill myself by taking about 30 Ibuprofen. My Dad found out and kicked me out of the house and told me to never come back because I made them look bad instead of acknowledging how I felt. This started my depression, depersonalization, and derealization which is still going on.

I then went to my mom’s full time until the court case was over. Through this time I was extremely depressed. I felt like something in me was empty or missing. I was feeling worst, listening to music all day, cutting myself, and eventually tried to kill myself a second time by trying to slit my throat with a razor blade. It didn’t work and only caused bleeding. Then in June I discovered a way. Drugs (Weed, Tobacco, Cough Syrup, Pain Killers), Inhalants (Aerosol cans under pressurized gas), and alcohol were introduced to me. I was high nearly all the time just so I couldn’t feel or think. It helps and I eventually found myself vaping too. Then the court case ended. My mom has me full time now but my Dad can see me with supervised visits after taking anger management classes and passing many drug tests. Well that was July and it is the turns out he hasn’t done anger management classes and he has failed every drug test. So it’s clear he doesn’t care enough to do better just to see his own son.  Then it’s August and I’m in a worse place than where I began and now I have more stress from school and social drama added onto that. 

I would show up to school with no motivation to live and when I did have motivation it was because I showed up high. I got a ticket for vaping on the bus and having a different vape in my backpack. Then in October I ended up in Crosspoint. This didn’t help at all. They didn’t do shit to help and I had to sneak caffeinated drinks to even be able to be active enough to be productive. I got out in 5 days from acting cheerful and happy when I wasn’t. Well now it’s November and my situation is even worse. I’m going through depersonalization and derealization again and I’ve been depressed and suicidal since March. I’m sick of this. I don’t want help because there is comfort in the pain and drugs but then again it’s affecting everyone around me including my mom. Seeing my mom cry because of my actions is one of the worst feelings ever. I cry myself to sleep every night wishing that I could make everything right. But at the same time I want to use drugs and alcohol because it numbs the pain and it’s enjoyable. My mom has been sober for 15 years and she doesn’t vape so I know how bad this must hurt her but it’s an addiction that I don’t want to stop doing. I just want to do it in a way that doesn’t affect the people around me. 

I feel empty when I’m not using so then I use drugs and then I feel guilty so I’m in a worst place again. Then I found myself taking a few edibles again. It’s a loop that I feel stuck in and don’t want to escape but at the same time I know I need to but can’t build the courage to do it. Just last week I tried to overdose and I got in trouble for vaping and having edibles at school. I hate the direction my life is going because if I continue my life wont have a direction to go in. Thank you for listening to me through this and if you can send feedback and advice in the comments it would help a lot."
1p426pc,I found out my friend cheated on her boyfriend,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I was talking to one of my close friends. We’re gonna call her Cherry.

Last night, me and Cherry were hanging out, we were just talking about whatever came to mind. We were laughing, then she got all serious. She said “Ezra, I need to tell you something, but you need to promise not to tell anyone.”. I stopped laughing and asked her “Why what’s wrong?”. 

She told me “You’re one of my closest friends so I trust you not to tell anyone, I promised I wouldn’t, but I can’t keep this to myself anymore. I just have to tell someone or I’m going to explode”. I’m wondering what she’s about to say and I’m just thinking a million things a second.  We have another friend, let’s call her blueberry, and her boyfriend banana. 

Blueberry and Banana‘s 1 year anniversary will be in January. So they’ve been dating for around 11 months now. I thought Blueberry was loyal. When I tell you that this girl constantly talks about her boyfriend, I mean it. She posts him all the time and I really thought she was loyal.

Cherry told me that Blueberry cheated on her boyfriend. I’m gonna call this dude Kiwi. She met him at a 4th of July party a couple months ago. He still lives in our district but he lives 2 cities over. I asked her how long she’s known this.

She told me how she was at a Halloween party, that Banana didn’t go to, and walked in on Blueberry and Kiwi doing stuff. I cut her off and asked her a million questions. “Wait what do you mean doing stuff?” “You mean kissing right??”. (Not that that’s okay either but I didn’t expect her to go THAT far) She said “No.” and explained what she saw.

Cherry said she confronted Blueberry and Blueberry broke down in tears, saying that she loves Banana romantically but Kiwi is more fun and “Better in some aspects”. Apparently Kiwi and Blueberry have been “Linking up” for a while, and she’s “Trying to stop” (Clearly she isn’t if she just did THAT.)

I said “Okay so did you tell him??” Cherry said “No I didn’t.” “Blueberry made him block me because she thinks no woman besides his family and girlfriend should be in his life”. 

I had multiple questions. Is she still doing it? Does banana know? Does Kiwi know she has a boyfriend?? Do her parents know?? 

Blueberry says “She’s trying to stop”. Kiwi knows she has a boyfriend, and he’s okay with it. Banana doesn’t know. As to if her parents know, she’s not sure.


I guess it’s kinda weird for me to go online and say it, even though I promised not to tell someone but I feel so guilty knowing she’s still with someone she’s she’s cheating on.

I’m not part of this. But I might block Blueberry because of this, and Cherry said she might too. I do NOT fuck with cheaters, even if they’re “my friends”. Banana has me blocked for the exact same reasons he has Cherry blocked. 


So yeah.. you can take this as me venting or asking for advice. I don’t know what to do and need to get it off my chest."
1p3tsqy,Why do I feel bad after rejecting a friend?,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Im not sure if this is the right place for this situation, but ill continue 

Im a teenage girl, and I just rejected a friend of mine that recently asked me out. But now that I'm thinking about it- i feel so sad and guilty, i feel like that rejection won't leave my mind. I feel like an idiot.

I dont have a crush on her, but I wish that I do.

We are at that level where we would flirt and always touch each other. I dont know why- but i dont want to stop that with her. I sometimes flirt with others but its not the same. I want to keep doing that with HER. I want to keep touching her and keep flirting with her, I dont want to stop. But i dont want that label: dating.

I wish that i do have a crush on her but i cant, i don't have butterflies in my stomach when i look at her, i dont follow any signs of crushing on a girl. But i wish that i did.

This is probably just a guilty weird thought that happens after rejecting someone. But please,  help me understand this situation.

I have an entire weekend to think about this before talking to her again on monday

1p2oqf1,I feel guilty for liking a guy,Advice,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"so a few months ago, this guy who I knew and was acquainted with asked me out to homecoming. i knew him well enough to say yes, but I didn’t have any romantic feelings for him. it was very awkward, because he tried asking me out to dinner and everything, but I had already made plans before he asked me. we went and had a good time, and I thought that that would be the end of it. but since I had his number, we kept talking after the dance. and we started talking a little more at school. and then I started to form a crush on him. and we talk much more now, but I feel guilty. I feel guilty for liking him way after he asked me to a dance, and only after he expressed some sort of interest in me. is my guilt rational?"
1p26ki9,"Any other students who’ve been buying all their own phone,ipad,airpod with own money?",Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I’m currently a first-year high school student in Korea.

Back in 6th grade, the last budget phone my parents bought me broke, and ever since I started middle school, I’ve been buying my own devices—phones, an iPad, AirPods, etc...using money I saved up myself.

It’s not that my family is struggling financially or anything. We’re doing fine. I just really didn’t want to depend on my parents too much, so I started buying (and sometimes reselling) my own electronics.  
(At the moment, I’ve already sold my iPad.)

But recently, I got into a pretty demanding private high school, and with the heavier workload, I don’t really have the time to earn money like I used to. Now I really need an iPad again for school, but buying it myself feels financially overwhelming.

So for the first time, I asked my parents about getting one… but I feel really guilty bringing up something that expensive. I keep wondering if I’m relying on them too much.

I’d really appreciate any advice from you all."

1ozkg2q,"Met my best friend after 19 months of talking. We held hands, hugged, fed each other… but she still doesn’t want a relationship with me",Social,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"So I (18M) have been talking to this girl (18F) for like 19 months. She’s my best friend. We’re stupidly close — hours of calls, constant texts, sharing literally every detail of our day.

We finally met once a while back.
We spent about 5 hours together, walked around, held hands, hugged, even fed each other. It honestly felt like a soft, wholesome mini-date.

Our connection got even stronger after that.
She says “love you,” she vents to me, she trusts me more than anyone, she cries to me, she tells me I’m her comfort person. She treats me like I’m the only safe place she has.

But when it comes to an actual relationship?

She flips.

She says stuff like:

“You can’t be my boyfriend.”

“I don’t feel romantic things.”

“You’re too good for me.”

“You deserve someone mature.”


Not in a manipulative way — she’s genuinely confused and has a lot of past trauma + self-worth issues. She’s not the bad guy here.

Yesterday we were supposed to meet again. She was really excited for it (picked outfits, planned her whole day). But my passport issue messed everything up and we couldn’t meet. She cried, felt guilty, and literally said she felt like she “wasn’t good enough.”

Then later she had this breakdown about being single, about everyone around her dating, and even said she might accept some random guy’s proposal because “at least he wants me.”

Meanwhile I’m sitting there like… bro… I want you.

I’ve invested everything in this connection, but she still can’t choose me.
She loves me in her own way, but not the way I wish she did.

I’m not blaming her. She’s sweet, honest, and confused.
But I’m hurting.
And I don’t know if I should keep being her safe space or protect my own heart."
1oz6ph6,I spent money that isn’t mine..,Serious,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I (16M). Spent over 210$ on Steam games using my mom’s credit card without her noticing. I bought Deltarune, Dispatch, Class of '09, Garry’s Mod, Portal 1 and 2, and a few others. I was about to buy Hades 1 and 2 for 42$ dollars, but the purchase got declined. My sister was in her room and checked our mom’s bank statement (which is what I assume since she told me of my little shopping spree). She saw that someone spent more than 210$ on Steam. She realized it was me. My mom still doesn’t know about the incident that occurred.

My sister came to talk to me. She told me to look at my phone and she started removing all the subscriptions I had. I was not mad because I knew I spent too much money on my mom’s card for games which I regret now that I can’t go back and stop myself. I don’t know if she will tell my mother about it but after the incident, I quickly head over to Steam support and requested every single purchase that I had made from Steam so she’ll get her money back. My sister you can probably guess is still mad and I don't know what to do because I feel guilty of spending so much that I thought was so little I need help. "

And i’m worried that i made her upset even tho it’s a mutual breakup. 

I am diagnosed with anxiety disorders so it may just be me freaking tf out lmao just wanted 2 say it somewhere but we share friends(and we didn’t wanna tell our friends we broke up because they would ask alot of questions n stuff) so i couldn’t say this 2 any1 else.

For 8 whole months i never gone back and i usually thought “They might have forgotten me by now” but recently i tried it again since i was craving it a little and went i met them, they gave the BIGGEST smile and said “haven’t seen you in a while, it was 7 months was it?” 
Like, how? they were located in front of two busy schools, how did they still remember me? So now i feel guilty about that"

1p1pomc,I hate living with my mom,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"TW :SH, suicide 

So, for context (If you don't feel like reading the context, which I understand because I really spent way too long writing it so it ended up being insanely long, you can just skip to me talking about some of my mom's abusive tactics, I'll just mark it as (END OF THE CONTEXT) so you know where to look) in 2022 me and my family went to live in my mom's home country because she was homesick and I'd just gotten bullied at school (by a group of people I thought were my friends as well) so I really wanted to get away. I was looking forward to seeing how it would turn out but it was really bad... My dad couldn't come because he had to see with his work if he could work from a different country and work from home so only me, my mom and my little sister went there and I feel like my dad's absence really made her feel as if nothing she did was wrong because living with her was awful.


 It's at that time I started feeling depressed and anxious and started really wanting to die, I really wished my dad was there back then. I did attempt drowning a couple of times but survival instinct always ruined it at the last second. Of course when I told my mom, she said it was bullshit and brushed it off which made me feel even worse.


 When my dad came back, things didn't get much better, I remember once she broke my phone by throwing it at my face (I dodged it and it landed on the ground) which caused me to get a panic attack and made me want to end it once more, my online friend dissuaded me of it, though. It's not the phone breaking that made me panic, it's the way she was ready to harm me this bad over a small diaagreement. My online friend was my only support back then, I didn't tell my parents about how bad I felt, much less my dad but I wish I would've. Eventually, I got distrustful of people, I started making less friends because I was scared they'd turn out like the ones who bullied me and I felt really lonely. The little moments we were together were always overanalyzed in my mind and my pessimistic way of seeing things always ruined it. 


After some time, my anxiety got worse, I had times I'd just faint whenever the weather was a bit too hot and start crying, sometimes it was so bad I'd talk about my suicidal ideation out loud. There was also a time I was doing a group presentation and I hadn't even talked yet but I just felt sick to my stomach, I was really anxious about the time it'd be my turn to talk to the point I ended up throwing up. Hopefully I managed to get to the hallway so no one from my classroom saw me but it was really awful walking home with clothes full of puke.


 It got to a point it became unbearable, I told my dad I was feeling homesick and he managed to move his work back to our country. My mom didn't want to leave so we left without her and went back home. I got into a new school and things didn't get better, I unfortunately had to drop out and do my classes with the very limited material that were in the school manuals. I started feeling a bit better and my dad started looking for ways I could get officially homeschooled and I even started seeing a therapist. I felt a bit happier although questions about school from her really made me feel bad. 


However, things didn't stay this way for long because my mom suddenly decided to come back home with us and I really didn't want her to, my dad said it was her house too and she could come back if she wanted to so I had no choice but to comply. The thing is, she came often to see us since she was unemployed and every single time she caused me a panic attack and a long session of crying, so my mind was warning me having her CONSTANTLY there would make things much worse. Unfortunately, my gut instinct was right and those types of outbursts were super frequent. They weren't even about major things, often they were about me taking a little too long to do her chores because I wanted to finish what I was doing first, even 30 seconds was too much for her. (END OF THE CONTEXT) Here are some of the outbursts she had recently: 


- One day she went out with my dad and came back to see I'd forgotten to do the dishes, I apologized and told her I'd do the dishes right this instant, no 10 seconds, no nothing. What was her reaction? She asked to take my phone away and when I asked her why since I was going to do it, she got even angrier, took it away AND slammed it against the ground. Basically, she broke my phone over some dishes. Then, she insulted me, called me stuff like a manipulator, a liar, a selfish person and mentally ill, she said I should get locked up BECAUSE I FORGOT TO DO THE DISHES. She kept going for 2 hours (really) and I ended up crying and panicking because I was still trying to understand, what did I do wrong? Plus my self-esteem was already low so hearing different insults about myself for hours really made me feel even more worthless. My dad confronted her about it but she blamed it all on me not giving the phone away which caused  my dad to give up and he simply sent my phone to repair as I needed it for my homeschooling classes.

- 2 days later, my dad said he wouldn't get my phone back despite it being already fixed and I asked him why (I'm sorry, I ask why a lot but my overthinking brain REALLY needs a reason so I can avoid doing it, of course I never actually get one) which made him mad and my mom joined in for no reason so now I had TWO parents angry at me while I was still stuck on the question of why they were so angry. I ended up crying and suffered a massive breakdown, I really got angry because my mom started doing something she does often which is basically mocking my crying whenever I do it and I yelled at her. Then, I locked myself in my room and before I knew it, I was stabbing my hand with a blade. I really needed to take out my frustration somewhere and I really felt awful because I kept messing up, it was the first time something like that had happened twice in a row so I felt like I was the one at fault there. My parents noticed it and my mom said she should lock me in an asylum, i felt so awful I begged her to go there, I really needed someone to vent my suicidal and self harming thoughts to that would actually take it seriously. We packed my bags but right after I was ready to go, my parents decided not to take me there because I'd spend months there. 

- This one happened yesterday, I was working at my desk on an essay I had due for grammar when my mom came into my room and asked me to push my chair because her shoes were there, I told her I was busy and focused on my essay because I'd finally understood what I was supposed to do and was being efficient at it and she bursted (again) and said I was selfish for letting her do that especially when her back and hand (she has arthritis) hurt so much. She insulted me and yelled so loud my dad had to stop his meeting just to ask what was going on. As soon as he did, I burst in tears and tell him I didn't understand what I did wrong, that because of her I lost focus on my essay and felt awful because she insulted me out of the blue. My mom of course repeated the whole arthritis thing and every time my dad gave her a counterargument it was ""Yeah but I have arthritis"", not a single ounce of regret was there nor was she actually sorry for what she did. She did ""apologize"" hours later but it felt so fake I didn't take it into account, if she cared she wouldn't have done it in the first place.

- Okay, this last one happened exactly today, that's what led me to write this down in the first place. So, today I was watching a series and I was almost done with the episode (I had 2 minutes left, even less if you count the ending credits) and she called me to bring her the vacuum cleaner. I told her I had to finish watching this and I'd be done in 1 minute and for the first 10 seconds she didn't complain but then she got bored and told me to go do it right now. My sister went to do it in my stead and that's when she got mad, she called me selfish, self-absorbed and a bunch of other stuff. She said I was rude for letting my sister do it (keep in mind, my sister did it unprompted because she didn't want my mom to get mad at me) and she kept going, I eventually went to check what was going on with the vacuum that was so important and she started complaining about her back problems, saying I should feel bad for making her do it (I was gonna do it, why's she acting like I said ""no""?) and then, she became even worse with the insults. This time she said I wouldn't ever have friends because of how I am, that nobody would like someone like me and I replied back and told her ""How'd you know? You're in your 50s, the people in my age range are almost 40 years younger than you"" and she then said my autism (I forgot to say it but I've been diagnosed since I was 11) is an excuse and she crossed a line and said my suicide attempts were excuses and a tactic to manipulate her. She didn't even stop there, she eventually started talking for super long about awful stuff (I didn't hear it because of the vacuuming over her voice) and after she was done, she told me to go to sleep. I cried for so long, I wanted to self harm, I wanted to die again, I was really looking for ways to die tonight but my sister told me not to. I texted my dad about it since he was out for work and he said he'd talk to her, I stayed awake until late to hear the conversation and I really wish I'd fallen asleep instead. My mom said stuff like ""I'm tired of being nice to that ungrateful girl"" or ""Her autism isn't an excuse, she's a bitch, that's all"" my dad tried to defend me but my mom turned a deaf ear and kept going. By the way, it'd been 3 hours since the whole thing had happened and she was still mad about it, still calling me this kind of stuff. 


And now, I really can't sleep, if she said it again 3 hours later then she probably thinks I am, why can she insult me for hours but compliments me every 3 months or something? My mom really hates me despite me doing everything I can to please her. Seriously, I never say no to her unless I feel vulnerable. I always try to rush and do the things she asks me to do asap but every single mistake I make is all she ever remembers, she treats me like garbage when I don't do stuff the way she exactly wants me to and it's been draining, truly draining to tiptoe around her, to fear the moment she comes into my room because it could be yet another scolding for something super small. My mom doesn't care about my mental health, all she cares about is having someone do exactly what she says. My sister becomes her favorite when she does the chores and vice versa, it's not genuine and I'm tired of pretending it is. I don't think I'll sleep tonight, I don't know how I'll manage to do my classes in the morning and that's the least of my worries right now.


Okay so... I said you could skip the context but actually this whole post was long as a whole, I wasn't sure if I should post or not but I ended up giving in because I need to share my thoughts. By the way, asking me to call cps isn't going to help, I already tried it and my mom pretended she was a really understanding nice mom who cooks, cleans and takes care of me and my sister, I told everything I could to them but they chose to believe her over me and called me a liar to my face. They went to check the situation at home after that and needless to say, they didn't find anything worth of note so they left it alone after that. I forgot to mention I felt guilty and may have unconsciously kept some details to myself because my mom basically guilt tripped me over it for 2 months, I couldn't enjoy my summer holiday because everytime she had to talk about how I told my therapist about what she'd done and how I'd never see the therapist again in fear I say something again (I never saw the therapist again, yay...)"
1oyhx49,am i being manipulated by my crush?,Advice,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"so basically i (13f) like a guy (13m) and we’ve been texting a lot. lately he’s been super confusing about his feelings — he joked about “swapping crushes,” and when i didn’t respond the way he wanted, he blocked me out of nowhere. later, he unblocked me, but the whole situation left me feeling really anxious and unsure about what’s going on 

(note that i also have pretty bad abandonment issues, so stuff like this hits me way harder than it probably should. when someone suddenly cuts me off, even for a few minutes, my brain goes straight into panic mode. i get super attached to people really fast, and once i start caring about someone, i kinda cling onto them emotionally without meaning to)

 after that, he started guilt‑tripping me, saying stuff like “enjoy hell mate” just because i wouldn’t tell him my crush (??) and acting like i did something horrible when i joked about liking someone else.

it feels like he’s trying to control the whole situation, making me question myself, and even using religion/morals to make me feel guilty. sometimes he flirts and acts sweet, and then suddenly he gets dramatic and intense for no reason. it’s honestly stressing me out.

am i overreacting, or does this count as manipulation? and how do i deal with him without losing my mind?

  
p.s. sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this, but this is the only subreddit i actually read so i’m hoping someone here can help"
1oypc02,I swore at my girlfriend,Relationship,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"It was just a stupid debate about me arranging to do an assignment in an interview format instead of a video with a slideshow and commentary. She was insisting that I would still have the 3 minute limit that applied to the multimodal assignment but I was saying that's ridiculous. The debate just kept going and it was in a group chat with our friends and they were all joining in against me. 

School is just finishing up and it's been the most horrible and stressful year of my life and all of these people condescendingly telling me (without knowledge of whether it was true and against a lot of logical assumptions) that I would only have 3 minutes to deliver my presentation to my teacher on the spot just made me really mad.

And I was just getting increasingly angry and then stupidly called her a dipshit which is honestly not an insult I can take seriously because I find it corny, but for whatever reason it's what came to mind at that time. I think in the same sentence I told her to fuck off or something. I think it was especially impactful because I usually don't even swear casually, but also just because she's sensitive and I think it was really unexpected for her. 

I messaged her the most genuine apology I could write a few hours later. I feel so guilty and mad at myself, and a lot of my friends are going to be mad at me too because what I did wasn't okay. I hope she'll maybe forgive me but idk if I can forgive myself 😞 it was so stupid and impulsive and I don't want to lose my temper and do something like that to her ever again."
1oxl35h,Confused with myself,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"This is a throwaway account I’m making. But right now, I’m really confused of my sexuality. I’m a 16 year old girl and as I’ve started dating during my earlier years I only ever went for women. My relationships though, were always a little rocky and I thought that meant I had a lack of attraction to them because at the time I had many issues surrounding men and was weirdly attached to them for reasons I’d rather not go into. I had crushes on fictional men but still dated girls. My previous ex, who I met online, came to me as a boy. But this was during probably the worst time in my life surrounding men and what they’d done to me. 

She eventually came out as a lady and I loved her still anyways, but she was always suspicious that I preferred boys more despite my overwhelming issues with men. In the end our relationship became incredibly toxic and bad and I took a liking to a boy in my friend group after we were talking about personal experiences and he was the only one who could relate. He seemed like he understood me and like he wouldn’t hurt me as they did, so I was infatuated. So I left my ex and now I’m with him. 

But as soon as I got with him I felt as if I didn’t like him, I felt out of place. He’s told me his feelings towards wanting to be a girl and everyday I’m desperately hoping he’ll take those steps to do that. Sometimes during intimacy I don’t know what to do or how to act because I’m wondering how it would be if he was a girl. I feel disconnected and as such it makes me stray from the relationship sometimes and become mean and lash out. I feel terrible since he’s a lovely boy but I want him to become a girl one day as he said he wants to. I keep wondering what it would be like if I could just be with a girl, as I appreciate how beautiful and clean and sweet they are. He is many brilliant things but I just like the essence of a girl more.

I can’t tell if I’m a lesbian, I don’t know what this means for me and I feel guilty. Please give me advice. Please nothing about breaking up since I don’t want to do that. "
1owq4ku,update 4: my cannibal boyfriend cancelled my escape flight and now i think he knows everything,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"update 4

it is one twenty six in the morning here in okc and i swear i have never felt this kind of fear before. the apartment feels dead quiet but i can hear every single movement he makes like it is right next to my ear.

i had a plan. i was supposed to leave next week on a flight out of will rogers airport. i told him it was to visit my aunt in arizona but that was a lie. it was my escape plan. i only have one friend in oklahoma city and no family anywhere near here so that flight was literally the only way i could get out without him noticing.

he found it.

i woke up this morning and he was sitting at the table with my laptop open. he never touches my laptop. he never even asks to use it. when i walked in he didn’t look surprised or guilty. he just said he noticed my flight date was “different from what i told him.”

he turned the screen toward me and the cancellation email was already there. flight gone. money refunded. he cancelled it at four in the morning while i was asleep right next to him.

i asked him why he was in my email. he ignored the question completely and just said i should not keep secrets from him. he said it in this calm way that made me feel like he already knows everything i have been doing. like he is waiting for me to slip up.

he has been watching me the entire day. following me from room to room. not saying much, just… observing. every time i pick up my phone he suddenly has something to say. every time i stand up he asks where i am going. even when i went to the bathroom he waited right outside the door.

i tried texting my one friend but the messages will not send at all. i tried data and wifi and nothing works. every app keeps shutting down except reddit which is the only reason i am able to write this right now.

i cannot leave without him noticing because the front door makes a loud click when you unlock it and he would 100 percent hear it from anywhere in the apartment. and at this point he is barely ten feet away from me at all times.

i genuinely think he knows i was planning to run and i have no idea what he is planning now. i think i messed up and there is no easy escape anymore.

i am so scared."

And it turns out that my best friend also has severe depression. But i personally do not want him to dropout becuz he got A\*A\*A\*, in a-level, and he had huge ambitions for college, he was passionate. i feel guilty, i think my drop out affected him to have such thoughts. And he told me yesterday that he was so depressed the day before, and he tried to call me but he didn’t becuz i didn’t answer to his texts. he didn’t want to wake me up.

1osp5g4,Am i a bad friend for this or is this normal,Social,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I’m 17F, and I have a big, really nice friend group at school. They’re sweet, buy me food, give me gifts, and include me in everything but sometimes, I just don’t feel like being part of it. On some days, I get so mentally drained walking around school with them, listening to gossip, and constantly moving from one place to another. I’d rather just sit quietly in class during break and relax. The thing is, I feel guilty for it. I usually lie and say a teacher gave me some work just so I can stay in class or sit with the few people who don’t go out. It’s not that I don’t like my friends they’re honestly great but I just get socially exhausted sometimes.

It’s like I’m “betraying” them somehow, even though we’re not together or anything. I end up feeling like I don’t deserve them anymore because I imagined someone else.

I don’t want to go into too much detail (because it’s a long story and I don’t want to explain it) but to keep it short: I was very bad at respecting peoples boundaries and knowing when the time was right to do things and when I should have stepped away. Long story short, I exposed things that I wasn’t supposed to at the wrong place and the wrong time, I did some…not so great things to people at the wrong time (and by that I mean some REALLY not so great things), and now I have a really bad reputation. To make it very clear, I DO NOT CONDONE/DEFEND MY ACTIONS IN ANY WAY. I completely own up to it and I want to improve as a person. Unfortunately though, rumors spread kinda quick, and a kind of decent chunk of people know about it. I haven’t mentioned anything about it to them and I probably never will, but sometimes they still give me looks and make some small comments about what I did. Luckily, the chunk of people that do know about it are in one of my electives which I’m planning on quitting before the second semester, so I wouldn’t have to worry about what they say. I still feel super guilty about my actions, and how bad it’s affected my already terrible reputation. I was already being bullied before (I’m the “weird kid”) and now it just gets worse. Knowing that all these rumors are true doesn’t help either. How do I deal with these rumors? Do I just ignore them? Any advice is appreciated :)"

1osey7h,Parents might’ve heard.. can anyone relate?,Relationship,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Sooo I did some sexual exploration with my boyfriend for the first time and it was awesome! BUT. Both my parents got mad and I’m pretty sure they heard..

Initially they said it was because we took a long time when he needed to go (because we needed to put stuff back on) and then they said they were uncomfortable. 

Before anything happened my mum said it was okay to do sexual things but to not have sex (we didn’t necessarily have sex) and now she’s upset

I talked to her and I feel guilty that I lied, but atleast she feels better.. I think

So yeah sadly we are edaters but are working towards it being long distance soon, We have been together for 3 months now and im 15 almost 16 and shes 15 

We were on facetime when she said it and she felt guilty and awful for it and I reassured her she shouldnt be and that its okay since they are her bsfs and known them for 3 years 

I dont really have friends to begin with my life is just studying till she comes back from school and we facetime right after, I communicated to her about it and said i felt like im not enough and i really cant help but overthink i thought of maybe pushing myself to do more for her and i told her and felt like i fucked up i dont want her to think that the way im treating her is because i want to be her top priotery and it feels transcational and i really dont want anything in return i just dont want her to think that its not geniune


She kept apologizing for it and said i already do too much for her and i feel awful i get that its normal that she puts her friends first then me but i dont know why it hurts me and i dont want her to feel awful about it it wasnt my intention to make her feel guilty or bad i geniunely dont know how to navigate this and i dont want to overthink about it 

Its our monthly anniversay too today and i already planned so much for it to be special but i feel like im going to ruin it for her since i dont feel okay and i dont want her to notice that 

I thought of pretending that im fine and save it for later since i want her to be happy today and im really trying my best to be okay 

I feel awful that i cant make her understand properly that i do love her and that i know its normal she puts her friends first and just feels like shes fucking everything up when she isnt

Maybe another thing to mention is that she hasnt told her friends about us yet and its rough for her since well we are edaters sadly and its killing her that she feels like im being hidden but i do understand and i told her to take her time

What do i do? i really want to communicate better with her

1ooypoi,Am I going crazy or is it all real?,Discussion,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Hey, first post here. So like for the past few days I have been really thinking like whether social media is just weighing too much over me.

 For context, I have had troubles with friendship before. My friendships before were formed since we were like in primary (1st or 2nd grade) and then it went on till like 10th (I left the country atp). Because the frndship was deep, many comments and actions were passed on which I felt really embarassed or sad or offended for, but weren't kinda a big deal for them. I have seen couple of of my frnds also leave our frndship for someone else (a lot of general middle school drama and all blah blah). After this I shifted school twice. The first school after shift was hard. Used to go there like many years ago and came back feeling like I had done the worst mistake for coming from somewhere abroad. Again rude comments and everything. And then I shifted schools again...and it been a ride. It's been 3 years and I had difficulty forming frndships and trusting people.

Now back to social media, I am kinda on the emotional side of reels. And after like doom scrolling a lot, I feel like I'm exaggerating my experiences... Like... I feel guilty thinking that maybe I really was the issue or like this was never a big deal... 

So have I officially gone crazy or its all normal? 

Sorry if this feels like a rant... Just want some ideas if this normal among us or not"

1omgmvd,I (17F) feel guilty and conflicted about a married relative (32M) who once crossed boundaries with me,Advice,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"

I’m not looking for validation or excuses. I just need to say this somewhere because it’s been weighing on me.





I (17F) have a relative, A (32F), and her husband, B (32M). They’ve been together for years and have a small child 2yr old. A and I have always been very close she treated me like her little sister and I’ve always admired her. I thought she and her husband were the definition of a perfect couple. They made me believe in real, lasting love.

When I was around 15, I stayed with them for a while during my school break. Everything felt normal, i had my best time with them. She was pregnant at that time. We would laugh and joke till 2 am. But the next year, I started noticing things, her husband began acting in ways that crossed boundaries like groping me I always tried to make it stop, but it confused me and made me question myself. One time i was aroused by his touched, I tried everything to remove his hands off me.

Even after all that, I couldn’t bring myself to completely hate him, which made me feel worse. I didn’t visit them this year for that reason. But recently, he reached out and started texting me. His wife doesn’t know. The messages are mostly casual, but sometimes he says things that feel inappropriate, flirty texts. I don’t respond to that kind of talk, and I’ve told him not to cross to touch me, he said he feels remorseful and won't do it again. Still, I haven’t fully stopped the conversation either, and I feel extremely guilty about it, our conversations are daily chit chats, sharing anecdotes and about our day.

I know it’s wrong, and I feel incredibly guilty for even talking to him. I don’t want to hurt A she’s someone I love and respect deeply. But at the same time, I can’t deny that I still feel attracted to him, and I hate myself for that.

I know it’s wrong that I’m even replying. I plan to stop, but I just needed to get this off my chest because the guilt and confusion are eating me alive. I wish things had never gotten to this point. I love A  and i don't want to ruin the relationship between us but deep down i'm actually attracted to the him, I like talking to him. I might have innapropiate thought for him, although I never acted on it or ever encourage such behaviour. Our daily chatting has started to feel more intimate now, not something i anticipated. Hence I'm going to stop talking to him. I feel like a vile, evil, disgusting person. They have a perfect life and i ruined it. 

How is it possible that he loves her soo much, even a blind person can see it, yet he flirts with me? I just cannot fathom that thought, i cannot believe he can ever do anything wrong. 

Anyways there is no justification to my actions, I just want to put it out there."
1on0047,I feel super selfish 😔,Serious,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Sometimes my mama will get ice cream, since both me and her love it.

I’ve gotten in trouble for this several times, but it never stops. 
I’ve been exercising and eating less to lose weight, which I thought would be a great way to lessen the chances of doing this again, but it still happened anyways. 😔 now I’m fat, guilty, and my mom’s upset at me.

1ompoga,I feel incredibly guilty.,Rant,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"For context, I went to the biggest amusement park in my country for Halloween with my friends A and M (we're all 13), we went with A's mom because she offered to go with us. We were there since 12 PM and my dad was going to pick me up at 8 PM, there are like three exits and my dad was going to be at the tupper (that's the name of the street) one. We had a fun day and they went with me to the exit, the exit wasn't the one we had said but oh well, I thought my dad changed his mind and told A's mom. The thing is that A's mom didn't go outside with me, she left me right before going outside the establishment and told me to go. I called my dad and told him that I was at the exit next to the tupper one (like a block or two away) and he told me to go inside and walk to the right exit from the inside but I couldn't, the guards wouldn't let me in again. Atp I was scared af and started crying a bit, A's mom asked why I was crying and I told her that my dad was going to be mad at me, I don't remember much  so I'm telling what I remember. My dad told me to walk from the outside so I walked like two blocks through a very dangerous street at a very dangerous time of the year, not ideal lmao. I finally got on the car which was right in the middle of the street when traffic was crazy and I told my dad what happened before I texted him before I was still scared. My dad got really REALLY angry at A's mom for letting me walk the street alone and not going through the exit he told her to go through and overall her being super irresponsible. The thing is that she answered the long ass message with a long ass voicemail where she was bordering hysteria saying that it was understandable that my dad insulted her (thing he did not do) and that i lied and it was my fault, she also texted me and told me that I shouldn't have lied to my dad (thing I did not do) and that now because of me everyone was angry at her. She also started gaslighting me into thinking that I should've communicated better, which in my opinion is ridiculous that a woman in her late 40s is blaming a 13 year old for nearly having a meltdown lol. The thing is that now my friends are distant with me and A's mom said she didn't want to see me ever again and that I was stubborn or something. Now, should I feel guilty? Because I do. "

1omirwv,Strict Muslim dad thinks I was with a boy — he’s going to check my phone and I’m scared. Need advice. 17F,Advice,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"Hi, I’m 17F Muslim. My boyfriend (17M) is an atheist but open to Islam since some of his dad’s family are Muslim, and he genuinely wants to learn about it. We started talking in September, and started dating about a month ago. We go to the same school.

We’ve only kissed/made out — nothing sexual. I know dating isn’t allowed Islamically, and I do feel guilty sometimes, but this relationship feels real and mature. We respect each other, we’re patient, and we’ve talked seriously about the future.

My parents are strict, especially my dad. My mum isn’t very strict, she has rules, but she's reasonable and understands I'm growing up. My dad, on the other hand, enforces Islam very heavily. He keeps pressuring me to wear hijab (I don’t wear it, but I dress modestly most of the time). He threatens me about it sometimes, even though he doesn’t follow through. He forces us to pray even though he doesn’t pray himself. He expects me to come home straight after school and hates the idea of me hanging out outside.

For context, I usually go home straight after school. On some days I stay out for maybe an hour with friends and sometimes with my boyfriend. In the mornings, I sometimes go to school early to revise and occasionally my boyfriend walks with me. Nothing crazy — just normal socializing and studying.

Recently I was out with my boyfriend sitting on a bench talking for around an hour. Somehow my parents got suspicious (they’re very street smart). My mum texted me saying my dad was going to check my phone. My dad used Family Link to completely lock my phone so I couldn’t delete anything — only calls worked.

My mum called yelling, and I panicked and denied everything. I asked my boyfriend to block me from socials just in case. When I got home, I left my phone for them. My mum “checked” it — but I know she didn’t actually look deeply. She knows how strict and intense my dad is, and I think she was trying to protect me by saying she checked it properly when she didn’t. She’s upset but not furious.

Later that night I unblocked my boyfriend briefly, but the next morning my phone was still locked and my dad said he’s going to “properly” check it when he gets back from the gym. I used my laptop (they forgot to restrict it) to re-block my boyfriend and clear my Snapchat chats, Snapchat call logs, and memories. Snap calls don’t show on my phone’s call log since I’m on Android.

The only thing I couldn’t remove was a TikTok-style clip where we spin and do a tiny peck kiss. It’s harmless, but I’m terrified my dad will find that.

Right now:

* Phone still locked
* Dad plans to inspect it
* Mum pretended to check it already to protect me
* Boyfriend re-blocked
* Only safe communication is at school
* Parents now don’t want me staying after school or going early anymore

I’m scared. I don’t want to lie forever, but I also don’t want my dad reacting harshly. I genuinely care about this boy and we’re taking things slow. My parents met at 16 and married at 19, so it frustrates me that they don’t give me the same space.

I need advice on:

* What to do if my dad finds the video
* What to say to stay safe and calm
* How to handle strict religious parenting without losing my mind
* How to maintain my mental health when privacy and trust are so strict
* How to be safe while still having normal teenage feelings

Please don’t just tell me to break up, I want guidance on managing this situation safely and respectfully.

Thanks for reading."

1olv80e,I get turned on by tortas and femboys😔🚫,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I’ve never told anyone this, not even my closest friends, because I know how absurd it sounds. But here it is: I get… drawn to tortas. Fat, short girls. And femboys. And somehow, together, it makes my heart feel like it’s going to explode in ways I can’t explain.

It started innocently enough. I was out one day and saw a torta walking by, her confidence, the way she carried herself—it hit me differently than anything else. I felt a strange, almost guilty rush of excitement. I laughed it off, thinking it was just a passing crush.

Then came the femboys. I don’t even know how to explain it. There’s something about their soft energy, their aesthetic, the way they move—it pulls at me in ways I can’t rationalize. I’d never felt anything like it before, and the first time I realized I was staring longer than I should, I panicked.

The thing is… when the two collide—me seeing a torta and a femboy together, or even just imagining it—my chest tightens, my thoughts scatter, and I feel this mix of awe, shame, and fascination that I can’t put into words.

I try to be normal, I really do. I tell myself it’s just a quirk, just a fetish, just something silly. But late at night, when I’m alone, I replay every moment, every glance, every feeling, and I feel this ache in my chest. I want to understand it, control it, maybe even be proud of it—but I’m terrified that anyone finding out would think I’m broken.

So here I am, typing this into the void, hoping that maybe someone out there gets it. That maybe I’m not the only person whose heart races over tortas and femboys in a way that feels shameful but also… undeniably me."

I don't want to be going out of pity, I know it's not going to be much fun because my friends tend to go home two hours after the plans.

I feel like I should also say I love my friends, but trick or treating isn't fun anymore to me. Nobody in our area participates in it and it will just be us running around a bunch of unresponsive houses with 6 year olds again... 

Idk, I feel guilty that I'm not hanging out with my friends now and need some reassurance even if it's stupid"
1oi1oas,Best advice for this situation?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),My friend got in contact with an old classmate who i really liked named soph back in high school. I wanted to apologize for crossing boundaries in the past. I feel so guilty and want to seriously apologize for what i did and said to wrong her. Should i move on? Should I just forget it. I wanna apologize cause i hate myself for never telling her how sorry i am and how i really feel so horrible for how i treated her
1ohv08g,Are mental health days from school okay?,Rant,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"SUPER LONG RANT THAT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE-

**||}** I have the kind of mom that will get mad/upset if you ask to stay home from school because you're sick (Only if you don't have a fever). There have many tons of times that I've literally BEGGED her over text to let me stay home because I feel sick (nauseous and feverish). In 3rd grade I had migraines for three days straight and for two of those she picked me up after the nurse called but acted all upset and said I couldn't do anything but sleep if I didn't want to be taken back to school. She makes me feel guilty for being sick sometimes as if it's something I can control, and as if she isn't a whole nurse.

**||}** Besides the point, I suspect that I may have a kind of depression (BPD most likely) and a few other things, and this literally drains me throughout the school year where I'm basically isolated due to my lack of friends and the fact that she's at work all the time. But, she has a youngest complex for me so I have to act all babyish, clueless, and innocent around her for her to be satisfied with my personality. Some days I literally ignore my alarm and wake up late so I can get an extra 40 minutes of sleep since I have to wake up at 6 am. Other days I can barely keep myself awake during school to the point of exhaustion as if I'm working a full-time job. I have a super hard time waking up in the mornings and my mom just ignores that.

**||}** I hate field day and I always have. One day at school we were only going to have one class (which would have been with the teacher both me and her hate) and field day for the rest. To convince her to let me stay home I made a list with 10 reasons, one of which was that ONE day off would be a good break from the 10 tests and essays I had had in the past few weeks. To this she yelled at me, calling me useless and lazy and saying I do nothing and don't deserve a break (not the first time she's done this). I was literally in the backseat of the car SOBBING, and she kept yelling. Just for her to tell me the night before the field day that I could stay home as long as I went to the last day of school which I haven't gone to in years and is only 3 hours long (I didn't end up going to that either). I feel mentally drained so much, but my mom acts as if it's my issue and that I'm too lazy to be exhausted/drained and can't stay home for one day out of the entire school year just because I can't even handle it anymore.

**||}** Also, a few days ago we were at lunch/dinner with my brother, his girlfriend, and his girlfriend's mom. I sarcastically said this one teacher makes me want to jump off a bridge, something I say a lot despite the fact I keep my actual suicidal thoughts hidden. To this she said with an irritated tone, ""Really? It makes you want to jump off a bridge? You can’t even handle a shot, and you want to jump off a bridge? Yeah right."" Like yeah, I have a phobia of pain, that's like one of the only reasons I haven't attempted yet."
1oi07j3,Idk how to feel about this…,Rant,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"So I (16m) was at a friend’s house (15f) for her fifteenth birthday. There were supposed to be four of us, but one girl lied about not being able to come, which annoyed us, so it ended up just being the three of us.

We started drinking — a lot. I usually handle alcohol fine, but I got way too drunk and even threw up for the first time in my life. Not exactly the best moment. After that, though, I sobered up pretty fast and stayed aware for the rest of the night.

My friend (the birthday girl) asked me to keep an eye on things so her family wouldn’t wake up or so none of us did anything stupid. The other girl (around 14, I think) was really drunk — loud, emotional, just not in a great state. After she calmed down a bit and we ate some food, we all decided to go to sleep.

The sleeping setup was kind of weird: me and the birthday girl on her couch, each on opposite ends, and the other girl on a mattress on the floor in front of us. Since my friend was exhausted and still a little drunk, she asked me to make sure the other girl didn’t do anything dumb while she rested.

But then things got… uncomfortable. The other girl started, um, touching herself. At first I thought I was imagining it — like maybe my brain was just tired or I was misunderstanding what I was seeing — but no, it was actually happening. She was doing it right there in the room, while we were both awake.

I froze. I didn’t say anything or look away. I don’t really know why. Part of me was just shocked and confused, and part of me — which I feel guilty admitting — was kind of turned on. I do find her attractive, and in any other context maybe that reaction would’ve made sense, but this wasn’t that kind of situation. It felt really wrong to feel that way, especially since she was clearly drunk and not fully there.

She stopped and went to the bathroom, and I told my friend just that part — that she went to the bathroom — because that’s what she’d asked me to do. I didn’t mention what I’d seen. And I still haven’t. I don’t know if I should.

It didn’t just happen once, either. She did the same thing a few more times that night, always when she thought we were asleep, and every time she’d try to sneak off afterward. Each time I told my friend she was getting up, but I never told her why. I just didn’t know how to even begin explaining it.

Now I feel really weird about the whole thing. I can’t stop thinking about how I didn’t look away, or how I was kind of turned on even though I knew it was wrong. And I keep wondering if I should’ve told my friend the truth, or if it’s better that I didn’t.

The next morning, the other girl didn’t seem to remember much of the night, which honestly made me feel relieved. But still — the whole situation just feels heavy and confusing, and I don’t really know how to deal with it.

Thanks for reading this — I just needed to get it out of my head for a bit."

1oh4d0l,How do you guys get the motivation to make things?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"(14m) I see so many friends, family and fandoms on the internet make cool things like cosplays, games or songs and it sucks because I want to make things (wanna do game design as a career) but never get the motivation to do it once I get home from work and weekends are just for recharging with gaming or yt. 

One of my friends made a full on Tenna from deltarune cosplay for a convention / haloween and it’s super impressive (lmk if you wanna see it) and is working on a RK costume too. But I never feel like I have the time to make my things and am super overwhelmed with school/work/scholarships anyways which makes things harder but when i do what I like i just get guilty and don’t change much.

Btw it’s not like im making no progress, im learning python for fun and bc godot is similar right now but only in free time during school and not outside of that so i still feel screwed for when im an adult and needing to be my own boss, what do u guys do to help with motivation?"
1ogqg45,I can’t get over my ex,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I can’t get over my ex of 2 years, we’ve been broken up for several months now and I can’t stop thinking about her I’ve tried talking to different girls, staying away from girls completely and tried even thinking about other girls to try and stop thinking about her and it doesn’t help that her birthday was last month and I found myself sending her a birthday message as if we were still together 

It’s entirely my fault we broke up because I cheated on her i and deeply deeply really regret it (more micro cheated then actual cheat but I still really really regret it and feel really really guilty even to this day) does anyone know good ways to get over her? "
1og8m4g,I hate it here.,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I’m 13, and the second oldest of my family. My mom and dad aren’t the best when it comes to good habits or keeping their emotions in check, which has caused all of us to have our problems from it, not even mentioning both of my parents are on the spectrum and so are all of us. I have struggled to get into good habits on my own, because my mom couldn’t be bothered to teach me routine when growing up, or was too fed up with my shit already to do it; as a result, I have problems with brushing my teeth, showering, and cleaning my room regularly. It’s also partially my anxiety and depressions fault, because the thought of getting up in the morning (let alone brushing my teeth and cleaning my room) makes me feel nauseous and guilty, like I’m gonna cry. Now, I have tried to get into good habits, and have particularly succeeded, but something always happens that breaks that habit for me; like when I got good at consistently brushing my teeth before bed for nearly a month, but I accidentally left my stuff in the bathroom one night and my younger sister put my toothpaste all over the door and dropped my toothbrush on the floor, which was covered in cleaning chemicals at the time. Or, when I got good at consistently going to class, and my mom had me watch my baby sister for a whole week. At this point, I can hardly imagine trying again, because what’s the point of trying if my little sisters are just gonna ruin the habit, and my mom isn’t gonna say anything?? It’s a waste of time and energy. I wish I was an only child. (Also, my depression is a bit better than normal! I’ve gotten better at ignoring it and pretending I don’t feel it, it’s better for everyone. And I know I’m not completely perfect, and that I play a part in it, I just hate having my stuff ruined right when I finally get into the habit.)"
1og5929,I just can’t anymore,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Dude i hate my family so much. I feel my my dads goal is to make me feel worthless. Hes openly told me im not special. And ya idc anibut i was like 11! My moms excuse is “oh he doesn’t know how to be a dad” YA OFC SO I SHOULD JUST TAKE HIS ABUSE THEN! I’ve tried to tell him how i do not feel loved he doesn’t care he actually said “i dont care”

Not to mention he makes me feel bad like openly guilty trips me because i wont hug him. I was SA by my bothers friend at 13 bro i dont let anyone touch me but he thinks because hes my dad he has the right to do what ever he wants with me.

Also spoiler alert im Bisexual. And my parents have already cut off my half sister because shes gay and trans. Like his own daughter he cut contact with. I made the mistake of telling my mom i thought i was gay back when i was 12 and she brought the whole church in for a intervention. So now i have to act like the perfect little Christian girl while screaming under the pressure of not being able to even cut my hair to my shoulders as “it shows gayness”

And then she wonders why i dont trust henor tell her shit. She fucking black mailed me and now expects me to trust her. I cant talk to anyone because its a small town and they will tell my mom. No one at school can know but then again they will not talk to me because i wanna take a “mans job” (im going into military/law enforcement) instead of being a vet or a something girly. 

Also im not allowed to have online friends because “they all wanna kidnap me” (spoiler alert i do but im scared they will find out) and if i even get close to a girl my mom starts thinking im gonna make out with her any second or something.

I have to keep everything bottle up and its slowly killing me from the inside out. I love the moon its docile and beautiful but apparently the moons evil and represents the devil so thats out. At this point im not even sure i believe in god any more because of how much its being pushed on me and I can’t even read the kinda books i wanna read because “its not lady like” what book was this? Harry potter. Its the devil apparently. I love fourth wing but because its Smut im not allowed to have it. 

Also anything about history. I use to love historical books but no killing of the devil. 

I just feel trapped. I hate this family and to make it worse my mother is trying to stop me from going to my grandparents where they have all my show goats and donkeys cows horses ect because every time i come home i have a “bad attitude” or maybe mother i have a bad attitude because from the moment i walk in the damn door my dads yelling at me and he don’t appreciate shit i do. I clean the kitchen? He yells at he for not cleaning the living room. I could clean the whole damn house and he would still bitch at me.

I just wanna disappear and I cant. I wanna curl up in my room with my puppy under a blanket and not come out. 

Oh also get this. I cant go to a college out of state because my mother doesn’t want me to leave home. And shes paying for college so i have to agree. So on top of one more year of high school i cant even leave and get away at collage. 

Theres so much more like how my dream for acting or writing was destroyed and SA was swept under the rug but if i rant anymore i might break Reddits servers. 

I feel better after this short rant but i still have so much bottled up and im just so tired of fighting. I just feel like i should disappear if you know yk. Me and the cat are one in the same.

1ofju19,The weird in between stage of teen and adult and seeing other people your age actually live freely,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I'm 19F, starting nursing school at a commuter school, and lately, I’ve been feeling left out. I had amazing friends in highschool, it was so much easier making and keeping friends.

I’ve also never had a boyfriend, and I feel like everyone else is having experiences I missed out on. Nursing school is mostly women and it's a challenging program, so I’m even more dreading the loneliness bound to come from the years I'll be there.

When my friend who lives in campus talks about all the fun she’s having, I get guilty FOMO and it makes me feel miserable when she’s happy, and I hate feeling this way. I feel like a horrible friend. She's trying her best asking me if I wanna come to her school but since I also have bouts of horrible self-esteem I just can't see myself actually ever breaking the coddling my parents instilled in me

Does anyone else feel like they’re falling behind? How do you handle these feelings? It feels like I've tried everything but holy shit the mindset is cooking me

1ofhwfi,I want to break up with my boyfriend... sort of?,Relationship,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I've spent over 30 minutes trying to get this post right and I just don't know what to do. I tried making an alt for this but I don't know how karma works and I just want to get some advice from somewhere so... yeah. If he sees this (which... he might...) I'll feel even worse...

I don't know what to do. I want to break up with my boyfriend... sort of. There. I've got that off my chest. I've been thinking about it for a little over a week and it's a huge decision, considering that we've been together for just over a year, and he's my first boyfriend but I don't know what to do anymore. I do love him but we aren't working. And I don't know if he feels the same or not. I don't know what to do.

I'm never excited to message him, I don't like looking at pictures of him, I don't want to talk to him or him to talk to me all the time, I'm not finding value in the conversations we do have, I don't want to hold his hand and I don't want to be with him. I know we're not going to last until after school is over for us. I don't want to last that long. We're so different, we complement each other in some ways, but he and I aren't working.

I find the smallest of things that he does annoying, I'm ashamed to admit it and I feel like a horrible person for doing so. He's not socially smart and he's been gentle parented his whole life so when things get hard he basically just cries. I understand crying when frustrated, even I do that &lt;/3 but this is different and I don't want to be in damage control for him all the time, especially when he slips up socially (which he does... sort of often...)

I'm an overthinker when it comes to popularity and social groups etc. etc. He doesn't give a shit at \*all\*. Some other habits and mannerisms he has drives me crazy, he can be immature when things go wrong and can't work as a team with anybody and is overly sensitive so every time we get into an argument I have to watch what I say so I don't upset him even more than I have. I never tell him what I really think and I'm sick of it. I know that I sound like a horrible person right now but I'm just not happy in this relationship and I don't know what to do. I promise I'm not a bitch, I'm just struggling here. I don't outright hate him, I just don't love him anymore and I don't want to be with him.

But even though I don't want to be with him, and I don't think we'll be able to be friends for a while... I don't know what I'd do without him we are a really big part of each other's lives and the thought of ending it is so horrible and daunting...

I've talked to him about not talking as much and just not being inseparable, but I feel little improvement has been made. I want the freedom to be myself and I don't want him to be with me. I can't imagine a future with us and I can't imagine a near future (end of school year) without us. I feel sad and almost sick when I think back to times we've made out, I feel guilty when I think of us as a couple because I've been holding in this secret and I can't tell anybody about it because it's going to get out somehow, through gossip etc.... I have a gift for him for our anniversary. That's another thing we have so different about us. I do commitments after school over 5 days a week and he does nothing. I don't have any time this term, I'm so busy and we've planned a date for next holidays. I don't even want to go anymore, but what do I say? His mum really likes me, his sibling is nice too and I just feel so horrible. I feel horrible. It's not fair. It's not fair that he's a nice kid and my reasons for wanting this to happen is because ""we're not working"". It's not fair that it's because of me. It's not fair that my personality conflicts with his and that I might have to explain that to him. My lousy reasoning doesn't feel serious enough, it doesn't feel like it's going to cut it. It's my first relationship and I don't know what to do.

If I do want to break up I'm going to do it gradually. I won't talk to him as much and get used to living my life without him. I need my independence back. I'll do it after I give him the present I spent so much money on... fuck it was like... all of my birthday money and so many hours hand making and finding the perfect themed gifts... dammit...

Basically, I don't know what to do. Please help me. I need somebodies opinion here, what do I do? This thought is really scary and I've thought it before but never this seriously. I'm terrified and I don't know how he feels or if he feels the same or how he'll react and I don't want to hurt him but I'm going to have to eventually or this will hurt myself and eat me up inside, I'll feel so much guilt every second we spend together. This post is sort of vague about him and details about me because it's on my main and I don't want him to see it and realise it's.... about him...

Edit: I did it. Thank you for your support. It was really hard in the moment but I already feel so much relief because it's off my chest."

She makes me feel very nervous in a good way and her laughter is very contagious. Not only that but she can literally play any instrument how is that not attractive.

Problem is she has a girlfriend and they’ve been together for two years now. I know her girlfriend and we used to have the same class my junior year. There is also some family ties there. 

I feel so guilty because obviously im not going to get in between them or anything but every time im around her it makes me forget she has a girlfriend.

It’s really bad i even had to start praying. Super confused and i dont know what to do. I know she just wants friends but i need some space but i also dont want space. Sos…"
1odd40x,Alright this is way more complex than I thought I need geniune advice what should I do?,Relationship,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"So back in 2022 I met a girl who I liked talking alottt she kinda knew I liked her within a week or 2 maybe a month idk it's just how she expressed from her eyes,talks,hints so I thought she find out I liked her but we are not done yet. Me and her always spent time almost every day we went at so many good places as together,as group (bunch of friends we both knew) and these same things goes by. Also I remember we hugged alot like alottt didn't seem like a friend hug tbh but yeah we hugged at a garden like straight up more than 20 times lol and 5 months almost goes by and in the middle of the 5th month she adds me up in a close friend list on Instagram and I found out she had a long distance boyfriend oh my god I was in literal shock like 5 months??? And u never talked about it? I even conffesed her that I liked her but omg I didn't see that coming.i could go through all stages of emotions but I chose to be quiet she knew she was guilty about it and yeah we slowly stopped talking within a few months (wild we still talked for few months). And now all the way to current time 2025 randomly I got a friend request from her on Instagram and I found out that she broke up with that long distance boyfriend an year and half ago. I instalty knew what was going on but I still thought no buddy don't think straight to that point maybe she just wanted to talk to u (lol).
She planned a dinner with the same group we used to spent time with and my confirmation got more confirmed when one of her friends started to ask me hey what's ur type blah blah blah what's your desire? I didn't say anything to that I mean I don't even remember cuz I said something so casual and lame but yeah I wish I knew someone would ask that so I'd just come up prepared but nvm I told my type,desire to her friend secretly so it wasn't lame and casual anymore. But yeah now she added me in close friends again posting reels giving me hints again. But she was done giving me hints and asked for me to start an evening walk with her I agreed on that and yeah it was a really good conversation with her ngl she seemed geniune to me and she even said I wish I didn't take 5 months to tell u the truth and she even said I wish I was in a relationship with u instead of my ex cuz she found out her ex had cheated on her like so many times (her ex cheated on her when she went to his state like they were long distance relationships couples like I said so she went to his state WHEN IT WAS HIS BIRTHDAY and a day before that she found out about it. Which is sad ofc but yeah other than that she said she don't regret leaving him cuz she even gave him a 2nd chance but he didn't change. So she just left him and yeah other than that we talked and had fun,made few plans and she asked if I ever got confessions I said yes I've got like 10-15 proposals she definitely made a sad face like not sad but like yeah disappointed face but then I said those proposals were before 2022 so she lowkey got relieved and then she asked did someone else conffesed u after me? (Me as in like did someone else come in ur life) I said yeah no ever since I stopped talking to u I didn't wanted to be in relationship much and I also started isolating myself alottt so no interactions with new people and yeah our conversation ended and we both went our homes and I started scrolling through phone and *A MESSAGE POPS UP* HEY (my name) I've got feelings for uuuu and then she said I didn't get scared sending this message to u cuz I wanted to confess to u ever since we met but I couldn't confess to u when we met in the evening walk cuz I wanted to make sure there was no one in ur relationship cuz if someone was I didn't wanted to come in between...
What should I do? 😭 Like I want her but 
She's an drug addict (every weekends with her dad sometimes)
She literally hid about her relationship for 5 months to me and she ssly used me as a friend for her emotional support ofc it's a classic thing as much I've seen relationships 
But in my case i didn't knew she was in a relationship.
If she cameback to me does that not mean I'm the second option?
Also what if i accepted her proposal and we build a big long relationship and i found out she has a friend just like how I used to be her friend back in 2022?

In case you're unaware, studying abroad is expensive. It is a huge investment so I can't imagine how much pressure it brings to my parents to mentally prepare themselves for this decision. 

A way I can support them financially is to find a job and earn for months worth of expenses in Australia. My family members have been telling me to do so since early September which I have agreed to. Why not earn some money when I've got the time to work?

However, I just couldn't be less motivated to find a job. The process of searching was easy, but applying? With visa statements also on the line, I just couldn't get myself into completing the letters for my applications. After I was done with the visa, I was completely burnt out from filling in applications. Fast forward to late October, I still haven't gotten a job which I feel guilty for.

To add insult to injury, my older sister keeps on babbling about me still not working. For well over a month, the first conversation everyday often starts with her telling me to find a job, lecturing me on how I'm being ungrateful for not preparing myself for study or how much my parents sacrificed just so I can study abroad and finally end with insulting me for being a useless parasite. (My parents probably don't know about this)

I am fully aware of the situation I have set up for my parents because of my grades, I am also not taking their sacrifices for granted, but shaming and ragebaiting is not the kind of motivation I need. I tried staying nonchalant and not taking her words to heart, but her insults still seeped through. I guess words from your family always hurt the most. The self-esteem I've gained fled with the rest thanks to her.

Here I am lying in bed, blaming myself for not giving my best to find a job and being mad at myself for being so unmotivated, lazy even.

My deepest appreciation to those who read through the whole thing. If you have any advice or tips (whether it's about getting motivated or less self hatred, whatever you have), please comment. 

Much love everyone. Never give up on yourselves."
1ocwfyl,Is it weird that I want to suffer from something really bad so that my dad finally feels guilt?,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I have had issues with my dad since forever. It's just annoying bc he never recognizes my suffering is his fault. I sometimes wish to get into an accident that is somehow his fault or something like that. This desire used to be even worse, I'd think about ""the self x"" every now and then and about writing the letter to finally make him feel guilty. Ik he'll never feel it, but I want to know if it's just me who feels like this from time to time."
1ocb5hl,what do I do? 😓,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Hi, so uh, I don't know if it's the right community but I want to think it is? So, my crush (16M) just asked me(16F) out, and we were in a hurry so I quickly answered and said yes? 
I'm actually pretty happy, but at the same time I'm so sad and nervous. 
So, for the context,
I was with a boy (16M) before, and he was my first boyfriend. The thing is, it didn't go well at all. He would do things without my consent and all, I don't really wanna go into details, he was just a very bad bf. And It's been like 4 months since I finally broke up with him. And since then, I was realy stressed about getting into a new relationship, because I'm scared that my new bf might act like the previous one? I don't know if I really am ready to date rn

But like, my crush, so now bf(?) is like the sweetest guy ever. Like really. He's sweet to everyone, helpful, pretty, funny, and I'm not even lying! I really like him. But now that we're together, I'm scared he'll become like the previous one. That, he'll get angry at me for not wanting things or doing things.I'm scared he'll force or make me feel guilty and all..

And rn, I don't know if I should already break up, even tho it's been like half an hour since we're together. Or if I should tell him everything and let him decide? I don't know at all, I don't wanna lose him. Even as a friend he's my best friend. And he's in my class and all. I don't wanna lose him or make him sad, and I'm scared that it will happen no matter what if I tell him everything..

I'm so sorry if this seem idiotic, but like, maybe you've been through that too and you could help me? You guys are literally my last resort, I'm so sorry :("
1oc1eut,how can i help my severely depressed brother?,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"TW self harm, depression and suicidal thoughts talk. 

my brother is seriously depressed. he self harms and has had thoughts of suicide before.

he has always struggled with friends, and he doesnt truly have any real good friends. he never really ever has. 

he has people he talks to at school, but he is severely depressed. he told me he just wants one person to invite him to stuff and hangout with him.

he is on medication, goes to therapy, etc. but they dont really help. we have tried so many things, and i think he feels misunderstood. 

im a full time college student and i have a busy schedule. i dont get to hangout with him as much as i would like to, and i feel so fucking guilty about it.

my parents can be assholes like all parents. my mom has been giving him and i hell for literal hours today, and we have both just been sobbing. it really affects him more than it does for me. i know he hides a lot of his struggling because he knows how much it makes me worry.

i can hear him sobbing in his room, and every night before i fall asleep i am deathly scared of him hurting himself or worse. i asked him earlier to please never leave me, and he just broke down sobbing. 

i dont know what to do, he just needs one good friend to hangout with him and invite him places. we are best friends, but its different when youre siblings. 

someone please help me. i dont know how to help him more and i wouldnt wanna live on this earth without him. 

i hate that he is hurting like this. i love him so much. please help me. i will do anything to help him. im so scared. "
1obu01r,The future (poem),Social,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"The future



They accuse me of remaining wounded,

of offering nothing, of burying a priest,

of returning in January with the same face,

of covering up for the guilty, of devoting myself to lying,

of devoting myself to predicting the fate that awaits me,

and all the fallen have disappeared over the horizon.

We take to the hills, to rest and die.

I am dazzled by the beauty of the unknown,

of everything lost to disillusionment,

they haunt the bars of despair,

through the alleys where they are hungriest,

and if I did nothing at that moment,

and I tell them, I'm truly sorry,

I just want to rest and not die.

And the future

They have found me guilty of confessing,

to my staircase, which connects heaven with reality,

with all the people who are always the same,

and I have yet to pour out my sorrows upon a shower of arrows,

and the freshly made bed that is my life, which never rests,

and I already know that loving is tiring. Not dying, and the future

It makes me dizzy to hide my future from my past

To rent the desire to always continue secondhand

He is the angriest king, the most bitter coffee

He who with his pain lives without suffering

And without falling into the abyss that is always trying to be happy

And wanting to rest but not die, he does see the future

I feel united to the terror that storms pass

With their brutal, slow cloud that invades here

And I who fell, and I who didn't understand

My blank pages nor my reasons for dying

And the future

I become other ghosts that pass by me

What if I come out badly? What if we leave here?

and move away and learn not to recover what was abandoned

and I don't try to force or make your desire to always relive the same sorrows climb entire hills

to the winners, who win to rest, not to die

and yes, for the future

I sometimes find myself alone talking with a seraph

who is afraid to promise me not to leave the end in my hands

at the funeral of the violent Cinderella life

that you no longer take into account, that I don't understand and never will

that the train that takes me to bed will never get worse

and the branches that rot in the gardens of Eden

don't try to return, don't try to rest, don't try to die

pay attention to the future

I have dedicated a lifetime to seeing what fails

and it's become customary that tomorrow doesn't leave home

I hoped it would truly be so

we didn't grow up to die and the future

have told me their secrets, their fears, and their worst fears

and I've been counting on my fingers the lives that I miss them

and when they attack you, you never think about running away

or about the future

the movie never ends, the cinema never closes

they never finish announcing the next battle

the detective never passes away

he always appears in his office

what's the revolver for? Who loved me?

but if I could really

afford the medicine

and the darkness lurks around every corner

it's increasingly elusive

from cemeteries and burial sites

and the barking of dogs and Iron Man

in the end, it's all your desire to die

they are the cause of the future

today it's easier to chase petals

and if you want to, leave them, and if not, it's okay

than to chase happiness, than to leave the pack behind

you can't search for it, you can't live to die

pay attention to the future

1obkrph,My ex boyfriend wants to get back together but my best friend is against it,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Hello, for starters and a bit of background me and my best friend are 16 and my ex boyfriend is 17. We we're together for 1 year and 1 month before I broke up with him. It's been 10 months since we stopped talking but are now talking again after my other best friend surprised me by bringing him on my birthday with a cake. He wants to get back together but my best friend is against it because of what happened during the relationship and after the relationship. 

To make things easier, I'll hide our names
Me - Shell
Bff 1 - Aubrey
Bff 2 - Hannah
Ex - Ryan

Aubrey's my friend since 3rd grade, we talk about everything and she knows me inside and out. She's my therapist at this point haha. Aubrey has been there while me and Ryan were dating, heard all the problems in our relationship and was even there when I broke up with him. I have a really bad memory with remembering things and feelings and that's why it's so hard for me to decide whether or not I should stop talking to Ryan. Aubrey wants me to remember the feelings and tears I felt when I was with Ryan, to stop talking to him. But I'm scared that if I do that then I'd go back to the same cycle again of me stalking and checking up on him. Crying when he reposts something that made me feel guilty. If I continue to talk to him then I wouldn't have to feel that pain anymore but it might lead to the same cycle of us not talking again and losing the spark of the relationship. It's both painful being and not being with him. 

You might be wondering now why we broke up and the reason we broke up is simple, I lost myself in the relationship. Who I was, my ideas and beliefs, and how I started to isolate and distance myself not just from him but to everyone elsande because of my nature to be alone and feeling overwhelmed with socializing with so many people. I'm not the type to be affectionate, so I felt that I wasn't enough to meet Ryan's needs(he's a clingy person and loves physical touch, I don't) the reason for the break-up was legit just me being insecure. I wondered why he wouldn't just leave me, knowing full well of how I am and how that affects him. Then Hannah brought him to my house to surprise me for my birthday. 

We started talking again despite Aubrey's protests against it. He wanted to get back together, to pick up where we left off, but this time I was cautious, I'm unsure if I should even be talking to him. But I was curious when I asked him why he wanted to get back together. He said he sees something in me, something that's hard to explain but it felt like he was winning. Which only confused me more and peaked my curiosity.

I want to stay and continue talking to him, to know and learn why he doesn't want to leave me. I'm not good for him, not good enough. I don't deserve someone who's as amazing as him. But I'm worried about the future, too, what if this is the reason me and Aubrey might stop talking? What if things go bad? There's a lot of things to consider. But deep down I do want to get back together, it's just that the fear is eating me up alive. He's my first boyfriend, first everything, first love, so it's not so easy for me to move on. He said he changed, but I'm not sure if I can trust him still.

So, in conclusion I need advice on what to do. 
1. Follow Aubrey's advice to stay away from him
2. Stay and see if Ryan really did change, this would make us friends to eventually lovers if ever things go well

Your opinions and advice would be greatly appreciated! "

1ob9qyr,Sense of dread after affection with boyfriend,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"To start off with some background info: I recently started dating the guy I have liked for a year ish. We’ve been friends for over a year, but have been closer since around January. We started dating a week ago. The timeline is a bit odd, I know most people say this but I have truly never felt as passionate about anyone before him. He is genuinely so sweet and I feel so lucky to be with him. I’ve expressed this to him and he’s stated he feels all the same.

So yesterday I had my first kiss with my recent boyfriend. It was really sweet. We were having a movie date at his house, just to set the scene it was really cozy and nice. I completely consented, I was more than happy about it. I have genuinely fantasized about the moment we would kiss for a really really long time.
        However I have a running problem with my relationships: to be fair, I’m not that experienced. I have dated 2 other people, one of which in middle school and was barely even a relationship. The problem being, I have this horrible sense of dread after any form of affection/intimacy. Kissing, cuddling, other “acts”, etc.. everything is great in the moment. But then after I have this impending sense of dread and just doom. I get horribly anxious, I feel regret, I feel shame, I feel guilt, I feel absolutely just heavy with dread. And it’s happened with all of my (to be fair, not many) relationships. I thought it would be different but it wasn’t. 
         My mom asked when I got home if we had kissed, she has been nothing but supportive and kind about all of my relationships but I lied and said no. I can’t even explain or name why? There was ZERO reason for me to feel anxious or guilty or like I’d get in trouble because I wouldn’t. She’s never been like that. 

I guess I’m asking if anyone can relate or explain? If it helps at all, I wasn’t sure if it would maybe explain why I feel the need to lie because my mom has always been sweet, I do come from a previous unstable home environment. I had a lot of stress constantly and it was somewhat unsafe. I have a history of mental health issues so I do wonder if that is perhaps contributing."
1oa23uu,How do I ask my parents to buy me a new phone?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Context: I've been using my dad's old phone from 2019. It was a good device for it's time, cost almost 300$ converted to US currency from mine. It runs quite well for its age but chrome often takes like half a minute to load, it just glitches out sometimes when I'm using this or that, stuff like that. I don't play many games but the ones I do play will run at 4 frames per second, takes a second to register input when in match which has left me unable to advance ingame. Youtube videos glitch out very regularly and it's unwatchable at times. Most importantly, the phone is almost chock full of old family photos, videos, stuff about my dad's work etc. Out of 100 gb occupied I think almost 60gb is that stuff. I can't even delete those, but they have taken up a lot of storage space. It's just generally annoying. Oh and the selfie camera is also busted.

So I'm looking to buy a new phone, and I have my eye on a model that costs roughly 130$. But the problem is, my parents have a project upcoming that would cost a lot (around 3.5-4k $) and I can't quite work up the courage to ask. Plus, it feels shitty of me to ask for a phone when they're already working hard to keep us fed.

The thing is, I'm not asking for a new phone so that my online learning becomes easier, I'm asking because I want to play games, take selfies, stuff like that. This phone runs my classes fine, so I'm afraid to ask them for an investment that I ultimately can't return.
So I'm feeling very guilty about asking for a new phone.

I can keep using the one I'm using right now just fine, but I *want* a new phone, not necessarily *need* one.

How do I approach this?

P.s.: We're not financially struggling in any way. My parents' monthly income rounds up somewhere between 1k-2k $ which is a very respectable sum in my currency. 

P.s.2: I have enough money saved up to buy the phone I want and still have extra left over. But the problem is my parents will skin me alive if I even dare suggest that. Idk why? I think that they think that I'm not old enough to make personal financial decisions?"
1o9y94e,Should I apologize to my ex for something I said after our breakup?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So, I dated a girl who’s my classmate and the same age as me. We started dating in class 7, and it lasted for about two years before we broke up in class 9. Now we’re both in class 10 — and we’re in the same section.

Back then, I really loved her from the bottom of my heart. For me, love meant everything — like the kind of love you read about in books or see in movies. So the relationship (and she) meant a lot to me.

For her, I think it was more casual. She used to get clingy with other guys, calling them her “brothers,” and that really bothered me. What hurt even more was that she didn’t give me the time and attention she should have. Instead, she spent most of her time with them, and sometimes she even mentioned that she was closer to her “brothers” than to me — which honestly felt like a huge red flag.

Eventually, I decided to end things. But after the breakup, I was really hurt. It took me almost a year to fully move on. I was angry and frustrated, and at one point, I said something really bad about her — I cursed her. I regret it so much now. Someone told her what I said, and she was really upset about it.

Recently, another girl mentioned that my ex still remembers that incident. Hearing that made me feel super guilty. I know I was wrong — no matter how hurt I was, I shouldn’t have said that.

Now that we’re in the same section again, I see her every day, and it just reminds me of how badly I messed up. I don’t have any feelings for her anymore, but as a human being, I deeply regret what I said and really want to apologize for it.

Should I go and apologize to her, or should I just leave it alone since it’s been a year?"

Do I send this to her instead? I’m a bit scared to send it, but I feel like I have to say this to her one way or another."
1o9hp6s,The text I couldn't send,Rant,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Bro, I miss y'all so much. I just want to move back to Louisburg and go to church and youth, and hang out with you guys and actually have friends again.
 I have no one here cause I'm introverted and shy and hate talking to people. And I have no way to meet people cause I'm not in school, I don't have a job, I don't go out at all. I'm just so lonely and the only person I can talk to in person is my mom and I'm so tired of texting and calling people cause that's all I've been doing for the month I've been here and I just want my life to go back to normal. I want to have money constantly and be able to do fun stuff. I want to be a normal 18 year old, not one who has to be super mature cause of all the shit I've been through. I've gone through so much shit in my life. I've been moving houses every few years since before I was in kindergarten. I thought Louisburg would be my final living place with my happy family, but then my parents separated and my dad moved out, causing my mom to get into a bunch of shitty relationships. One of which ended up getting my mom evicted from Louisburg making me and my mom have to move in with my dad, I haven't had my own room since then except being at your house. I just want this all to end. I want to wake up back in 2017 before my parents got separated so we can live in Louisburg as a happy family. I hate where I am in life, I just want everything to go back to normal. I don't even know if I could go back to normal now. Would I just forget this all happened or would I feel guilty for hating this life when there's people who are homeless and would love to be in the situation I'm in right now. Idk what to think. Should I want to go back to normal or should I want to stay in this life since we have it better than some people."
1o9gi2d,Update to this post I made last week,Social,Uncertainty About Boundaries,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Good news! M (the friend) isn’t mad at me at all! We’re both doing just fine now and talking just like usual. In fact, I feel like it brought us closer together. I feel kinda silly now because I was really worried it’d be the end of our friendship.

The friend who told me hasn’t really been at school this week, so I couldn’t tell if it was supposed to be a test or not.

But there is bad news. The guy started trying really hard to reach out to me. It’s no longer just like “have a nice day” or “how are you?” He’ll go out of his way to compliment me, joke with me, and just always talk to me if I’m in the same room. I know he isn’t doing anything illegal, but it still makes me uncomfortable for some reason? I feel guilty.

I tried to just act disinterested, but he still persisted. I think if I want things to change, I’m going to have to speak up. But I’m scared of people still. I’m also scared I’m going to seem stuck up because he hasn’t even formally asked me out yet. But I know I need to do it myself because there won’t be anyone to speak up for me when I’m an adult. Someone give me the confidence to actually reject someone pls🙏"

1r26yzv,What should I do?,Serious,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"It's the 12th of February, 2026. 
I'm a student, my boards are coming up soon and I have still not gotten admission in any school.
I've always been a bright student, but STEM was never my first choice. I'm very inclined to arts and humanities. My father who is the sole earner of the family had made it clear that i WILL take up Science, like my brother. I protested but eventually quit.
A random saturday night, when he was drunk and arguing with me about something, i said something that caught his attention(about news) and he gave me permission to take up Arts in 11th. I was overjoyed because it was a dream come true to me. Immediately after, i started checking for admission portals and resources. It was still very early so I had to wait a long while. Throughout this phase I believed my father was finally supporting my dreams to study arts.
On the 30th of January, when my preboards ended, I successfully submitted my results and documents.
On the 3rd of February, I got selected for an interview in my DREAM SCHOOL. I went and i gave the interview. Guess what? I was selected and the provincial admission was done.
The authorities said that the fees concerning the admission and the grade 11 should be cleared out, in case of any financial difficulties, we can submit an application for an extension.
While we were at the office, my father grumbled about the fees but i thought it was usual nonsense(ps:my father wastes a lot of money).
On the 6th of February, the date of payment, my father said he won't WASTE money on a child who is taking up arts. He said that as if i'm some asset that he is investing in. Completely withdrawing his support last minute and leaving me devastated. He didn't pay ultimately and I have now lost my seat as well as admission.

I have always had family struggles since my father is abnsive(physical+mental), this blow was too much and ever since that day i have been crying every time i get reminded of the issue.

Please help me with some advice, i had already lost the will to l!ve, i was hanging by a thread, this did not go well and now i've even lost the urge to study for boards. I've tried mental helplines but the call doesn't go through for some reason."
1r2brcw,So recently I saw something very stupid (this is political),Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So recently I watched this [Video](https://youtube.com/shorts/OFKNSl5Oft0?si=Q_AMJXS_kxVFtctu). This guy was yapping about how this representative in Texas  said that “they want to kill white people ” now clearly in the video yes you can somewhat interpret it that way like I wouldn’t say it isn’t like entirely impossible he meant that, except the killing part I don’t really think it is at reasonable to say he’s calling for the murder of white people, but I would say it would be somewhat reasonable to think he’s calling the replacement of white people (I am not believer of the “great replacement theory”)  but I find it very unlikely he wanted to replace white people. Anyways I wasn’t super pissed about that part I was more pissed about the part where he said quote “but an elected official is calling for the elimination of the native people of the land.” THIS SENTENCE IS WHAT FUCKING BOTHERED ME. White people are not the native people of this land nor are black people are Hispanics or Asians the only native people of this land are the native Americans (sometimes referred to as Indians.) So this fucking loser saying that white people are the native people of America says a lot about him as a person. Then when a watched a few other of his shorts he said in one short that not all muslims are violence but islam is and not all christians are hot but Christianity is. That’s bullshit any religion that promotes any form of violence, is a violent religion so if islam is a violent religion then so is Christianity. This truly shows how people don’t read their fucking books for their beliefs and need a pastor to sugar coat it for them "
1r2aoqc,Is he really just not into me,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So I (teen F) was kind of talking to this guy for a bit. We were saying good morning/goodnight, liking each other’s messages, texting somewhat consistently. It felt like it was heading somewhere , not official, but definitely more than just random classmates.

At one point, he told his close friends he was into me, which is part of why I felt comfortable thinking this wasn’t just “friendly.”

But recently I found out that when one of his friends asked if we were still talking, he said “not really” and that it’s “just friendly, not like that.” That completely threw me off because our conversations didn’t feel strictly friendly to me at all.

For context, I’m over a previous relationship and genuinely felt like I had healed and was ready to move forward. I thought this might be a new lead for me. So now it feels less like “oh well” and more like a small setback, which is frustrating.

I ended up sending him something like, “hey sorry if this is weird but I liked you and thought you might’ve liked me too. I just want to know so I don’t get my hopes up.” He replied “hold up” and then disappeared. I just said “mk” and left it there.

At this point, I assume the answer is probably no — but I guess I’m struggling with how to move forward gracefully if that’s the case.

Now I’m wondering:

	•	Is this already my answer?

	•	Should I have just waited instead of saying something?

	•	If he replies tomorrow, how do I not look dumb?

	•	And if he doesn’t, how do I move on without feeling embarrassed?

He’s pretty nonchalant, has had a lot of talking stages before, and replies late even when he’s active. I’m starting to question if I ignored red flags because I liked him.

Be honest , is it kind of obvious he’s not that into me anymore, maybe never was? And how do I move forward in a way that protects my peace  "
1r22kg9,Haven’t processed my breakup yet,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Had absolutely no clue what to tag this as, but it’s pretty much just a rant anyhow.

Let me start off by saying English isn’t my first language, so if something doesn’t make sense grammatically, that’s probably why:)

So, like the title says I’ve just now come to the realization that I haven’t processed my most recent breakup, and I think it’s messing with my head a little. My ex and I dated for almost ten months, but broke up about a month and a half ago, and after maybe two weeks I was already in a new relationship. Awful of me, I’m aware. I broke up with my ex because of our differences, and because I could tell I was feeling different about my best friend (Again, horrible). So, being the worst person at being single, I rushed into a brief situationship with my best friend, and now we’re together. The issue lies in that I feel almost no grief or sadness about my ex, which is odd, because in the relationship I had before him, I was absolutely HEARTBROKEN for months. But I barely think about my ex, it’s like the ten months I spent with him are missing, and I don’t care. I care about my ex a lot as a person, as he’s never wronged me and he’s one of the best people I’ve had the pleasure of knowing. But I think I’ve forced myself to be fine too quickly, and now I find myself almost “wanting” to miss him if that makes sense? I feel as though I’m doing him an injustice if I’m not devastated by his absence. I don’t miss him however, and I LOVE my new boyfriend.

It should also be said that me and my ex were very different, and our “romance”(?) wasn’t all that meaningful nor passionate. We had nothing in common, and barely talked about anything “deep”.

TL;DR: I rushed into a relationship two weeks after a breakup, and now I feel weird about not missing my ex"
1r1wci4,Gf has a guy friend that makes me feel insecure,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So I've been dating this girl for about 11 months now and she is genuinely amazing like I could not ask for anyone better. I met her through a friend because she was best friend's with his girlfriend.  
We go to different schools so I can't see her every day but the 4 of them are together so they have a friend group and sometimes go out. He's fine, doesn't really seem like a threat or someone who would do something and I'm pretty sure he's in a weird complicated relationship with another girl right now and honestly but here's why I feel this way.  
My girlfriend liked him a while ago but it never really got anywhere but in my opinion most of the time when you like someone even for a bit those feelings kind of stay in the back of your mind even if it's just based on their looks. He's objectively way better looking than me (taller, better body and just overall more handsome) so that coupled with the fact that my girlfriend had feelings for him at some point make me worry a bit. They used to talk through instagram photos a lot and it kind of bothered me so I talked to her about it. She understood and kept giving me reassurance that she would never do anything to hurt me and that even if we weren't together, there's no way that she would go for him. She said that she would stop sending him photos but it never really stopped permanently. Just stopped for a few days and picked up again when he was sending her pictures of his trips and stuff. Also a little while ago I saw her TikTok saved videos and saw one that was along the lines of ""2 Boys, 2 Girls, Endless Memories"" which was very obviously about a friend group where both girls are dating the other 2 boys. I asked her about it and she said something along the liens of ""Ohh i thought it was just about friends"". My girlfriend also unfortunately has a pretty lengthy past with guys because she's kind of clueless when it comes to getting hit on and never catches any hints until it's too late. My girlfriend and he started talking more because they used to be a friendgroup of 3 people: her, her best friend and my friend, but then my friend and her best friend started dating so most of the time she would just be a third wheel but then my friend brought the guy i've been talking about for so long into the mix and it became a 4 people thing. My girlfriend claims that he ""saved"" her from being the third wheel and doesn't want to stop talking with him because those 3 are the only friends she has due to her going to a very small school. Am I just delusional and insecure or do I actually have reason to worry? I've talked to her so many times about it and I feel like she's getting tired of me overthinking so much so I'm contemplating whether it'd be best to let go so both of us can be at peace."

1r1rn7g,7 months after i left the server btw😂😂,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),Pretty popular tiktok artist and their mod saying this behind my back. I dont know what i did because im pretty sure i said nothing about their mother. What do i even do now.
1r1s35g,"I punched a friend at school, what do I do?",Advice,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Idk what to tag this as, but today I punched my friend at school.

So, we got into a stupid argument. We were trying to spell words on the calculators we have, and he was going ""Try to get this specific letter. I won't tell you how. Good luck!!"" and he said that shi like 37 times. He was irritating me a lot. I told him I would punch him if he wouldn't shut up. 

I saw him casually talking with a friend I currently had no problems with. I guess I got really upset that he upset me but my other friends were fine with him. So I ended up punching him. He of course got really upset and said why did you do that"" and I said ""because I told you I would."" I saw him telling the teacher, and I am really scared I'll end up in trouble.

I've been in severe detention before for punching someone else before (back like 2 years ago). And I was told that I would/might get suspended if I did something like that again. I go to a very good school (and I'm an all-A student, too), and I don't want a bad record on my hands.

I apologized to my friend (mostly because I was scared of getting in trouble. I struggle feeling bad for other people, but I knew that it was the right thing to do anyway. I may not feel properly or how others do, but I do have a sense of morality.), and several times. But I'm still scared that the dean (esp. the mean one) will pull me aside and get me in trouble. My best plan so far is to say ""We already resolved it, and I apologized to him already."" But I don't know if that will be enough.

That same morning, my friend also called me narcissistic. It's a really bad word to use especially regarding the community of actual narcissists and people with NPD. I personally heavily display those traits, so I don't mind using it for myself, but I know he meant it in a more offensive way. He also acts like being narcissistic is wrong in some moral way, when it's really a serious condition.

I guess the bigger problem here (just in general), is that I feel like my wants and needs are \*never\* taken seriously. Nobody in my class likes me, my friends don't like me, my parents don't like me, I don't particularly like myself. Nobody cares, nobody will, and the people who do, well, they can't say anything about it. I desperately need therapy and help and everything, but nobody knows me and what I'm actually struggling with, nobody cares, and nobody can help.

I know I have issues, and anger issues as well. I know I'm incredibly violent, but I'm so pent up on the inside and I don't know what to do except violence. I suppose this day, my friend being awful to me and irritating me was the final straw (I also didn't eat anything at all, and I was extremely tired). Just saying this as explanation, not justification. You can decide if it's justified in some way, but I don't think it particularly matters in this context. 

We both did something wrong today, but for some reason physical violence is worse than verbal or mental violence. No one ever takes me seriously, and I can't get the help I need. I'm constantly struggling, but no one ever asks or even looks. I think my signs are obvious enough, but nobody cares, and nobody can help. I'm tired of ""it will get better"" because the future doesn't promise anything, and I'm struggling \*now\*. 

I'm scared, upset, and need help. No one ever takes me seriously, or even likes me. I do have online friends, but that's as far as it goes. I feel like no one understands what I'm going through even remotely.

I guess advice would be good, but I guess I just need some pity and sympathy. I'm not a very good person, but I am a conscious and feeling being."
1r1oseu,i feel hella paranoid rn,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"sooo my (step) brothers old friend ended up following me on instagram and I followed back because he looked older &amp; I didn’t recognize him at all. We started talking and getting to know each other (Age, area, etc) and he gave me a lot of compliments saying that I was beautiful. He asked me if I had any brothers and I mentioned my step brother’s name and he started getting nervous then told me they used to be friends. I looked at his profile better and I seen his name and omfg. this is the kid who I watched grow up with my brother since elementary. He is a year younger than me but my brother is 2 years younger so I felt kind of weird about it. 
In the moment I brushed it off because the age isn’t really a barrier. I told him I didn’t want a relationship and he said he understood. We hung out today and we made out, and he tried to get closer but I told him no. Later on I asked him why he stopped being friends with my brother and he said that he had SA allegations against him… that caught me off guard so hard and made me start to rethink everything. 
When I got home he texted me saying he’d like to see me more often and that he is starting to really like me, and that he felt a connection with me. I got a lot of anxiety from that because he also started saying he wanted to be with me. 

I do think he is cute and I am attracted to him, but I feel like this is all just morally wrong and I’m doing something disgusting behind my brother’s back. I feel like meeting him was a mistake and now I feel like I can’t end this without hurting his feelings. And that makes me paranoid because then he’d start wanting to rant to friends and he will tell them who I am &amp; somehow speculate it back to my brother or any of my siblings really. 

I want to break things off but in a subtle, honest but nice way. plspls clutch😢"

1r1lwcp,“That One Exam Where You Disappoint Everyone — Including Yourself”,Advice,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"My economics teacher called, but my sister answered the phone. He said that your sis  had scored very badly — only 30 out of 80 — and he was completely shocked after seeing my paper. He spoke to my sister for about 15 minutes and said that he did not expect this from me at all. He said he was very disappointed because he was expecting at least 70+ marks from me. He kept saying that I am a very good student, which is why this result shocked him so much.
Later, he spoke to me directly and repeated the same thing — that he did not expect this from me and that I had disappointed him. He even said that he checked my paper four times to make sure it was really mine, because I am not someone who usually scores this low.
I am currently feeling a lot of guilt, regret, and shame. I did not expect this from myself either, because I usually score between 70–80 marks. Looking back, I realize that I was overconfident during the exam and did not pay enough attention while reading the questions. I completely accept my mistake, and I am taking this as a lesson to be more careful and focused in the future."

We see each other in the hall every day but last week, for the first time in months, we talked while walking. It’s been almost a year of liking him. I want him to just know and read my mind or something so I don’t have to actually confess to him. I think about telling him but then I realize how genuinely crazy I sound since we don’t know each other all that much anymore

Do I just send a reel and hope for the best? I can easily avoid him if he rejects me but my worst fear is that he actually will reject me🫩🥀"

1r1czok,can a guy change his opinion of a girl?,Relationship,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"hi guys! i really need some honest perspective.

there’s a guy of my age in my school that i’ve liked for a while (i’m a 16F). there were some rumours about him liking me (they started literally out of nowhere) but all of these were most definitely a lie. his friends were teasing him for “liking” me. a couple of weeks ago he told my acquaint that he doesn’t like my appearance which hurt like hell…

A BIT OF CONTEXT: we have completely no contact. like probably a month or two ago i reached out to him but he said he didn’t know if he wanted and that he was not really looking for communication (please don’t get me wrong now i’m still confused because the signals are so mixed, like a couple of months ago he literally told my teacher that i’m the most beautiful while discussing girls with his classmates and my teacher). at school we make eye contact almost every time we meet but he looks at me like at a piece of furniture idk. like completely ignoring. i’ve made so many first steps already so i don’t think i’m ready to do more…

i’ve been on a huge glow up journey recently. i’m not ugly and considered conventionally pretty… like a lot of ppl tell me that.

so my questions are:

• what are the chances of him changing his mind about me?

• what should i do for him to like me?

• have you ever had any situations when you’ve changed your mind of a girl? how did it happen?

guys i beg you BE BRUTAL, i really need your advice. i feel so lost and i have completely no idea what’s going on and what should i even do… and please don’t tell me to move on. i have a huge, i mean HUGE crush on him and wanna be with him"

1r1akhb,So My school had some illegal tik tok  thing and I need your opinions (read body text),Serious,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"So basically today in the middle of 5th period today some high ranking teachers were telling ppl in my class to go talk to them etc. It was mainly the popular kids who get in trouble sometimes and get on social media i.e. tik tok. I heard some ppl talking about a tik tok account, and how the ppl being sent out were following the account (im not on tik tok so i havnt heard of the account at all)

So like 10 mins after that all started (ppl were still getting sent in and out at this point), another high ranking teacher came in, closed the blinds to the windows that show the hallway, and told our teacher that we cant leave for the next period until they say.

Because of all this i asked a kid in our class, whos friends with most of the ppl who got sent out, what happened, bc i expected he knew. He just told me ""I cant tell anyone"". 

Like 20 minutes in i heard ppl in my class talking about police. The teacher told us about some law we have here (UK), and how its illegal to use AI to do bad stuff etc. Pretty much, he hinted that the ppl being sent in and out for interrogation did some bad stuff on tik tok with AI.

Once we got sent out for 6th period, i was talking to this other guy who saw someone try to unalive her self in the school by jumping down something (which would totally unalive her, its like 3 floors). 

After school i spoke to a yr 10 and said that someone *did* try to unalive themselves, but they thankfully get caught before they could jump and is safe.

I have a contest coming up, should I submit this?

&gt;!Him!&lt;

&gt;!I don't really care all that much, but I feel as if I should. I don't really know what to think anymore; things are just getting so confusing. I have no idea what I should do. This is a dumb thing to be worried about, I know it is. If he were still here, he would be kicking his feet and laughing his head off. That reminds me, I wish he were still here. After giggling for a minute, he would've held me while whispering me to sleep. It's not like he's gone gone or anything, he just moved really far away. The thing I was worried about before was whether I should text him first. I don't really believe he would want to talk to me, but a few weeks before he left, before the ""fight,"" he told me that I could text whenever and he would always answer. I'm starting to think that's no longer true. Right before he left, he never answered my apology texts. As I said, if he were here, he would find it funny I was freaking out about texting someone, he would snatch my phone and somehow composed a message that said everything I was thinking. I wish he were here, so he could write himself the text, the text that tells him how much I love him, and how I didn't mean to ruin everything. He's always been able to read my emotions, except for one, but that doesn't matter. I'm sure he knows how I feel right now, but if he did, why wouldn't he text back? I wish I had answers, but maybe I should just wait for him to text me first. I'm not ready to let go; I still need my best friend. I still need him. !&lt;

&gt;! Things like these shouldn't bother me anymore. I should simply move on. Why can't I move on? It's been months, and I haven't gotten a text. Maybe he has moved on, or maybe he's simply waiting for me to be the first to text. Yeah, he's just waiting for me. I should go and text him. But what if he really does just hate me? I mean, he has every right. If I text him this late after the ""fight,"" he will assume I'm some creepy dude who can't get over an old friendship. Yeah, I won't text him, I shouldn't. This is for the better, for me and him.!&lt;

&gt;! I texted him. He hasn't even read it yet. Maybe he blocked me. Wait, it doesn't let you send messages if you've been blocked. Maybe he is just ignoring me. What if he changed numbers? Perhaps I should check his social media, just to see if he is alright. His account has barely changed since he left. I guess I expected his bio to say, 'I have completely moved on, and I have tons of new friends. I mean, just look at my awesome photos,"" but when I check it's just his name whereabouts and a few emojis. His photos only includes landmarks, and there are no new friends in sight. I was being silly, I'm just worrying over nothing, he'll text when he is really. He knows I need him. He has to know.!&lt;"

I asked them why, they said that a ""socialist was running it"" or something. I dont know and frankly dont care.

Either way, the first act of the set was this generic country band that I swear to god sounded exactly like all other modern country bands. ""bmm-tss-bah-tss"" drums, slide guitar, and the vocals that every country singer ever has to replicate.

Also kid rock was there but he looked like darth sideous and could barely sing at all because he was so old. The song he performed was cut short because he's so old and horrible.

But at least it wasnt the first act... Genuinely Id rather listen to old ass kid rock than modern country. Now I gotta ask if anybody in this sub actually listens to ts🥀"
1r11zwy,How do I become his friend?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Okay so I saw this reallyyy cute guy in one of the lecture halls last month, and he seems like exactly the kind of guy I wanna get to know. He's tall, wears glasses, doesn't really talk to people, and sweet too. He's held doors open for me after lectures end and stuff, which isnt as common as u might think. He's almost always alone, seen him maybe talking to one guy but thats it, has headphones in. But the other day I saw him watching the rookie, and I loveee that show. So ive been wondering how to use that to talk to him for a month now😭 the thing is, im always with my friends, in a group of 9, and they never leave me alone. But its not just that, im also really introverted too, so im wondering how that would go...? Its so bad, I even dreamt that I became his friend the other day💔 pls someone tell me how I can start a convo with him🙏🙏

A month later: 

I saw him sitting alone in a corner again today, and I decided to talk to him after 1 month. My heart was beating like crazy and im pretty sure my breathing was off. But I did it! I walked up to him and asked him if he watches a show ive watched, cuz I saw him watching it, he said yeah. Then I just said I saw u watching it the other day, I love that show too. Then I asked for his name, he asked for mine and I said it was nice meeting you😭 the whole thing didn't even last a minute, but hopefully I catch him walking back to our apartment soon and ask if he wants to be friends? He's rlly introverted and so am i but he has only 1 friend, and I dont wanna scare him away or annoy him though. He has kept the apartment gate open for me and stuff, so im not totally no one to him. Should I continue trying to talk to him? My heart was beating so fast though, idk how to stop that from happening whenever we talk... maybe until I get a chance to talk to him again i should just wave and smile? I wanna explain my awkward behaviour today and possibly become friends with him. Maybe get his insta? My friends found it by stalking but I dont wanna request to follow cuz that would be too obvious...  Not too sure how to go about it though, and how to make him comfortable around me because hes more introverted than me.

My dad drinks bad, no fees for school, comes home late, late as like 5 in the morning typa late, and all of us can't sleep thinking about him. He's like the best person when he's not drunk but one drop of this dogshit can change him into such a bad person. I vented all this out to one of my friends. He suggested separating from him for a few days so maybe he realises the consequences. And I'm pretty sure I'm ready. You see, he lives one state away from me, around 500 km away. But That doesn't really matter. He said that he'll book a train ticket, take care of stay, and take care of food and other stuff. The night before I leave (I probably leave on a morning of Saturday or Sunday), I'll write a note with necessary stuff on it (But not where I'm going because then they'll come looking for me), and not to file a missing complaint, and that I would call regularly. Packing a bag without anyone knowing with all the essentials is gonna be hard, but I'll manage. I'm going to stay at his place for a week until things cool down. Also this might seem very unreasonable but trust me, the amount by which I've watered this down is unbelievable. If all this doesn't make any sense my friend is in his 20s and he has a job. So maybe that makes sense. I'll post an update probably when everything is planned out. Also I cycled like 12km to get to a quiet place so that I can type this out peacefully. it's 6 in the morning, I left at 5 haha. it's at a river which is usually crowded but uh most people prefer not to bathe in the cold ass water of 5 clock."

I (15f) have alot of guys friends. Not in a pick-me way, but i just feel comfortable with guys, and ive known most of them since sixth grade. I have this family friend I hang out with alot, and hes older, so i talk to him about my social life to get advice since he used to be a very rebellious teenager. Whenever he sees me with one if my guy friends, or i talk about a convo between me and one of them, he always makes a comment that they like me/want one thing from me.

Everytime he says this, i always get disgusted and tell him to sh\^t up. Today we were waiting for my mom and sister to get home so we could go out to eat for his and my sisters bday, and we were talking aboutwho i would sneak out with.

He doesn’t mean it in a weird creepy pedo way, and i KNOW he doesn’t. Hes worried, and i refuse to believe him. Im definitely not the prettiest girl, but by far not the ugliest. Many of my guy friends have said they see me as a guy (which he also says means they like me), and alot of them has called me ugly so.

do all teenage guys only think about sex with their female friends, or is he out of line??"

I was in the car with my friend and his dad, who was the first to see and point it out, and pull over.

1qzp46x,"hello guys, to whoever hates on AI, don't worry, i hate it too.",Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"&gt;The sad and obvious truth of the matter is that art, once formalized or mechanized, is no longer art; and the few arts that have not been formalized are now being mechanized. There is no mystery or talent required to create ""artistic"" beauty; and if a talentless person can do it, why should we give any regard to those who require talent to produce the same result? John may spend a week painting a tree, but Jane will take a photograph, and then use a workshop program to make the picture appear painted. There is no visual art created before the last century that modern technology would not have allowed a less talented person to make better and faster. Let us be realistic and assume this trend will continue. There is nothing we can do to avoid the solemn fact that Michelangelos are no longer needed.

i just came here to type this quote, it was said (typed actually) by Jack Masters, the author of Poorly Planned Comics YEARS before AI was even a thing, he hid in the 53rd comic as a character's line. Jack suffered from Schizophrenia and various other mental disorders, he occasionally also went by the name of Simon Sane, which he wasn't, in fact, his last entry to his Poorly Planned Comics was a suicide note. I guess i'll have to say this, AI was not made to replace humans, it was made to replace human error."

1qzljza,I am slowly loosing my mind because of the arguments in my household.,Serious,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I need to vent and I thought maybe you guys could help me on this one. It's a long one so buckle up.

I (14M) live in a household that is usually great but the arguments are the issues.

Like the argument that has just happened. So my dad started a argument with my sister (21F) who was annoyed at dad acting like he must be above all people. Like my sister mentioned something she recently saw about and my dad replied ""You two live in this"". And when I joined into the fight (I didn't even hear the argument which has turned heated a bit) I gave a example to make my dad understand that we don't actually look at this news constantly (because we just watch what comes on the for you page). My example was about a train conductor who recently was... let's just say deleted in Germany after a passenger just attacked him because he didn't want to step off the train. My dad immediately went with ""Where did you find this news? On your YouTube Shorts stuff. You were at least an hour on it before you found it"" which just doesn't make sense at all.

And that's when disaster strikes because my mom enters the argument. She got woken up by my loud sister. And what did she start with when she heard about our side of the story ""I am very annoyed with you (sisters name) because you leave your dishes in the kitchen and I have to constantly clean up the kitchen for 3 hours after coming home from work"". 

We were obviously confused about what she was talking about because that was a topic change that didn't make sense.

Anyways my mom started acting the victim (like always) when my sister started arguing with her. 

At that point I just was trying to do what I always do and that is trying to be the coach basically because I was trying to make this argument actually calm. Like always my dad just told me to shut up.

And then my mom went at me because I said that I will go to sleep, and then she also started to say aggressively (like always mind you) that I didn't do my laundry which was still sitting in the dryer and that she told me like 100 times to get that done (she didn't btw). And then she made a small mistake of using my excitement of my PS3 slim arriving tomorrow against me (she told something equivalent to that instead of doing laundry I constantly talk about the PS3).

For me it then ended with me telling her to shut up before I went into my room.

Dude I at this point know that I have the role of being the coach here because otherwise it gets messy. But I always seem to fail.

And also my mom is someone who makes me mad quietly on the inside every day because if only even one thing is wrong (like someone forgetting to put their cup in the dishwasher) she will start being passive aggressive, being aggressive and also she will start screaming at you.

While my dad is the person who will tell you to shut up. But honestly for him I lost all of my trust in him because if I don't want to go to church or I feel sick (somehow we are a Christian household) he will punish me by not giving me WiFi and or doing something else... Not to mention he cancelled my therapist appointments (which were paid by the Health insurance. We live in Germany btw), because after 8 months of going there I barely made any progress in his eyes. He did not even ask me anything he just decided it. And btw I did make progress and I started being less aggressive at school (that's a different story but basically in my first elementary it got so much bullied physically and verbally that I started doing it as a coping mechanism), but he just didn't care.


Sorry about this being a big mess but I just wanted to be able to blow my anger out somewhere without blowing up on my parents or someone else."
1qzhxxq,How do I teach my father (50male a lesson),Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I (17 female) am so pissed….at this point I think I’m pissed by his existence. I love people. I love learning about many things about different people and (obv) automatically I have respect for people. Plus I’m kind… a little too kind and I feel like that’s something I have to fix.

However I wouldn’t say I have respect for my dad as my respect for him is slowly declining.

1.He is lazy : he has never cleaned the house or cooks. He only cooks when my mom goes on a business trip to Durban… and that was 2years ago. If he doesn’t cook it’s my brother and I.

2.he complains yet he never fixes his problems.

3.he’s an Uber driver : not that it’s a bad thing…I thinks. The problem here is that  I’ve NEEVERR and I mean NEEEVVVEER seen him use his money for important things. My mom is struggling with paying for my school fees and my sisters school fees, paying for groceries, for clothes, and I bet paying for the house too. And the only thing this guy is paying for is his BMW he has to pay off

4. He’s full of hatred : homophobic, racist, yada yada and all the good stuff😑

5.he has the mentality that adults are always right

Anyways

TW :

Last year he hit me… hit me for what you ask? For not ironing my school shirts on time. I told my school counsellor and she said she’ll speak to my mom. My mom later on told me that the counsellor said that if  he does this again she’ll call CPS. My mom had a conversation with me and told me all the things I did wrong. I admit that there are things I have to fix when it comes to my behaviour and I am very much ashamed of it. Yet mom made excuses for him saying “you know how he is, although he is not willing to learn you have to still listen to adults”…..

Istg. She made me feel bad for even talking to my counsellor saying that if I talk to her again CPS will be called to separate my sister and I. My brother will be fine bc he’s an adult, but my mom and dad will be arrested….. alrighty I guess🫤🧍🏾‍♀️

Few days later he didn’t apologise, instead he said, “ if you listen to me then I’ll listen to you, I don’t want to fight with you, give me a hug”. My respect decreased and I’ve been avoiding him like the disease he is.

Anyways Leme make this quick,this year when I made food, he complained that he was still hungry (my mom made him more food…wierd). He threw a hand cloth on the floor for me to pick up bc he said it smells. He leaves things on the counter after making food, I told him to pack up when he’s done, he agreed but he continued doing that. Like today he left something in the shower bathroom, the bathroom my brother and I use.i put it infront of his bedroom door to know that he needs to put that away but my mom said I have to do it for him.i AGAIN told him to put things away but he made excuses.He always pressures my mom to go somewhere she doesn’t want to go and she ends up going anyways.  He also pressures her financially. And he talks to me like I’m a dog. I want him to stop. But I know if I “talk back” or set boundaries  he might hit me again.

What do I do?

Plus his stupid cologne is flipping suffocating

Edit: have I mentioned that I also suspect him of cheating….. what a lovely man he is right?"

Anyways stuff didn’t work out and we stopped talking. Tbh I was over him within like a month and a half but now FOR SOME REASON i want him again.

A month after we broke it off I randomly encountered (drunk) and we started chatting and basically (drunkenly) i asked him if he’d want to talk again and he just said not at the moment. That was 5 months ago.

Between that and now he’s been reposting stuff about “missing her” but tbh idk if that’s about me or not cus i also have no idea about his dating history. One time after a party, i heard his friend talking to one of my friends about how he “felt bad for me” about what had happened with me and the ex talking stage. Our break up wasn’t anything serious so I tried to listen in but i couldn’t hear and then when my friend told me later, i didn’t really believe her because what she told me also sounded pretty stupid.

Last week I went to a party and he was there and we made insane eye contact the entire time and had a (very) embarrassing interaction for like 2 seconds. He then liked my post from that night and he’s been STARING at school so much. His friend also just snapped me a pic of him. (i’m not snapping his friend in a weird way)

When i was younger, like 9-12  my cousin used to inappropriately touch me. I didnt understand it at the time and i guess i thought it was normal or just didnt want to say anything. It always happened at night so nobody would notice, but my younger cousin eventually found out what was going on. Sometimes when we went to sleep he would lie inbetween us on purpose, so he wouldn't do anything. Then we both knew what was going on, but still nothing was said or done. After some time it just stopped.  Partly i think on my side, that i had just tried avoiding him or even declined if he tried anything. After it happened im pretty sure i told my grandma something, because we used to hang out at her place, she didnt believe or just didn't understand what i was saying. I mean yeah, she couldnt believe that  her sweet little grandchild would do something like that.  A few years ago i actually realised and rememeber what actually happened and tried talking about it to my parent's.  They kind of understood and told me he was just young, and bored.He was  12-15.

1qyxldv,I saw the girl I liked making out with another guy,Relationship,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I just need to vent

Basically, last year I was interested in a girl from my class. She's smart and, although not conventionally atractive, for me she was beautiful. So, I asked her out and got rejected. Alright, that happens. No hard feelings.

So this year our class is basically the same and so she's my class too. Although I said to myself I moved on, I was lying. I still had some feelings for her.

Yesterday (Friday) we were in a party. I was with a friend and we were looking for our other find who went missing. We found her, but stumbled upon the scene: the girl I liked making out with the new guy who joined our class. We left the scene to leave them to their privacy and went back to the party. I was quite bummed out. It seems he did not even like it that much, he said it was ""ok"", it seems. And the people of the party, her ""friends"", said he settled for her as he is ""too much"" for her. I thought that was quite mean, but did not say anything as most there didn't know I had a crush on her at all.

Today, that's all I can think about. I can't take my mind out of it. I can't concentrate, can't play guitar, can't do anything without remembering the scene. What should I do?

Edit: I should probably add that last year she was giving me some mixed signals. She was talking to her friends how helpful I was being to her (I am the smart kid of my class and help everyone, me helping her was not a way of me trying to be with her, just me being nice), how a nice I was and how she loved me being at another party we were, because she saw ""another side of me, a funnier one she wasn't expecting"". After this my friends started hyping me up and I thought she liked me."

he came over and knocked on my door. i opened it just slightly, about 4 inches only. he forced it to open wider, while i pulled cuz i really didn’t want him in my room. it was like a tug-of-war, one forcing it open, and the other forcing it shut. 

the guy’s like, 30-40kgs heavier than me, it’s no surprise he won and the door flung open. he then squatted, wrapped his arms tightly around my knees, carried me, ran to my bed, and dropped me there. he immediately plopped his full body weight on top of me, against my body with my legs open. i wanted to cry, i thought i was gonna get raped. i wriggled to make space for my hands to be able to push him off.

my mom saw the last half of what had just happened, because guy friend forgot to close the door. as soon as he saw my mom, he didn’t bother to get back to me and left my room. 

my mom knew of me and my boyfriend’s confusing relationship — “together, but not together.” 

she might’ve thought guy friend and i were (consensually and voluntarily) making out, so she brushed it off.

even with my confusing label with my boyfriend, i told him all of this cuz i just felt he should know. he texted my mom about it immediately. 

my mom barged in my room and asked what happened. it hadn’t even been 5 minutes since he left our house, so i haven’t processed it then. she was asking too much questions which i didn’t know how to respond to.. “did he try to kiss you?” “how long has this been happening?” “what did he say he wanted to do to you?” “did he want more?” “has he done anything like this before?” — it was all just so overwhelming, she was asking questions that required me to process what had just happened first before knowing how to respond, and she was already forcing me to report it to my dad.

i yelled at my mom. it wasn’t because of the questioning, it wasn’t because she was trying to have him exposed asap, it was because it’s my story, so i felt i should be the one telling it when i’m ready. 

expectedly, she got hurt i yelled at her. but what i didn’t expect was that she’d drag it so far. she told the rest of the family i was “like a wild animal,” crazy, narcissistic, manipulative. 

now my parents are against me, and the only person on my side is my younger brother. my mom starts victimizing herself further, merely because my brother was defending me.. “you two don’t care about me,” “maybe your lives would just be better if i were gone,” “nobody appreciates me”

i’m just so puzzled as to why my SA experience led to my mom becoming the center of attention. things got really heated, and now it’s as if we’re all living separate lives (i’m only in talking terms with my brother). i don’t know how this all became my fault, and it’s gone to a point i began blaming myself for the SA too.

was it my fault? was it bad that i needed time to process? if the SA didn’t happen, the family wouldn’t have broken overnight.

And I find him cute and all, I wanna talk to him. But there's a problem, I find it hard to approach him because my friend told me that he'll probably ignore me because he's not talkative. And the only time I see him talk and have fun is when he's with this friend who also seems to be autistic. (My friend said, though I also am ND), and I do enjoy their jokes when I'm just listening when I'm with my friend. Their humor is funny and all for me. And the only time I've ever approached them was when I jokingly asked his friend if he could give me some of his hand sanitizer that was hanging on his ID lace. Then that was it. My friend though warned me that his personality is trash because he supports Nazi and he's 'racist'? I don't know what to do because I know she won't help me talk to him. Help?"

1qyfncw,I wanna share something bad and dont mind me cursing.,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I'm a highschooler and I have been living in my neighborhood for almost 10 years. There is a restaurant 2 streets away, and I walk that way to school every day—my usual routine.  
It's a famous restaurant, and there's a gutka shop nearby, and that is where disgusting mf's stay. Shockingly, there was an employee who used to stare at me like I was the only female he saw. Fucking bastard.  
Once, I was walking alone that way, and he was right there. He muttered something in Hindi and called me baby. I wanted to choke him right there. I was so nervous that I walked down the busy street without looking back. I was about to cry, but I just cursed him so bad I could feel the rage in my veins. Fuck it.  
You know what? I'll tell ya'll how he looks. like a monkey with rabies. 5'0, acne so bad I could see it through his pants on his ass, and that fucking hair. It was wavy at the front like bangs, and straight at the back. I could kick his balls without lifting my leg. He is that short.  
I seem so crude rn, but actually, I was so sensitive before. I had anxiety attacks because my dad had always said my body was too big or curvy. I believed it until i cant. I might seem like I'm overreacting, but I soon started noticing more men staring at my chest or face. This is so sickening."

After the event was over, i came home however my friend stayed at school. She was waiting for her dad ig and she saw my crush with his friend. She texted me and I told her to send me snaps of him. She sent me three snaps of him. She was just staring at him the whole time i guess and he noticed. He approaches my friend after his friend leaves. He asks her if they know each other as she was staring at him continuously. She was embarrassed and got caught lacking. So she told him EVERYTHING. Like starting from the fact that i had crush on him, my name, and all. She told him that i wasnt approaching him because i thought he had a gf. And the reason i thought so was because i have seen him several times with a girl. We have a park infront of our school and the other day he was walking in the park with a girl and he was even holding her bag. He waits for her outside the school sometimes. Which makes it pretty obvious that he has a gf. I had accepted my fate. I was ready to move on but then this happened! My friend told me that when she mentioned it like him having a gf thing, he didn't say anything. Because if he had a gf he would have said that but i really think he has a gf. Anyways, so I tell my friend everything like about the girl and she thinks that it could just be a friend. He's in 12th, commerce. I'm in 11th, commerce. His boards are near and he'll soon leave this school. Idk man i think i dont want him anymore. Like its honestly very embarrassing for me. Like yk people often confess their crushes like its not really a big deal for them. But for some reason its a big deal for me. I feel exposed idk i feel like a creep.

1qydwsa,I am so tired of people not givng me a proper advice in some subreddits. So Ill ask for advice here about my family problem. My dad is ruining out family.,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So I'll just say it again. 

I have a problem. Family problem. 

This will be a long post so please bear with me, I really need help.

And in this past two days some truths came out that I learned, that hasn't been out in an open.

For background:

Me (18F) and my older sister (22F) doesn't have a close relationship with our father. It was due for the fact that he is an overall horrible person with an old mindset and close-minded—leading both me and sister depressed in the past. 

I'd just like to add that we have an older brother (27M) who is a physically and mentally disabled, so our dad mostly do the duties for him.

And we aren't Americans, so we still live with our parents as our culture is very family oriented. 

Now onto our cousin: 

My cousin (21F) lives with us when pandemic came. She started to live with us due to her horrible brother being violent, and since we are close, we used to have lots of sleepovers until she eventually stayed when pandemic came. She is basically like my best friend and like another older sister. She doesn't have a father, so seeing her and my dad grew close, I felt happy for her. I dont really mind it at all since I dont like our father, and if she's happy then Im okay with that.

Everything was fine.

I only noticed something weird was going on when 2 days ago :

Me and my older sister went to buy a gift for our dad. We were having a hard time figuring out what our dad's size may be. We couldn't pick a different brand other than Levi's because it's the only thing my dad actually wears and he's very picky with jeans.

Luckily—our cousin—who is closer to our dad than we are knew his size pretty well. 

But we noticed that she was wearing a Levi jeans too. We thought she bought one for herself but our cousin says that our dad actually gave it to her, even calling him ""daddy"" as well as she tells us about it.

I dont really mind it that much at first. Afterall, my cousin had told me before that our dad gave a permission to my cousin that it's okay to him for her to call him her dad. And Im good with it, I just really assumed that it's like a father figure thing.

Then afterwards, we went to eat some food. My sister and I discussed our plans on what type of nurse we're going to decide in the future (since we both are a nursing student), then I asked my cousin, who is a criminology student, what her plans were.

She then told us she wasn't planning to be a cop anymore. 

Which me and my sister didn't like, since our family paid for her college tuition. 

So later that day, when we got home, my sister went to her room while on a call with our mother (who works overseas). 

My sister then later called me to her room so that we can talk. 

My sister told me that she felt off about the whole thing. Not just the whole jeans thing or nickname thing or the fact that she doesn't plan to be a cop afterwards, but their relationship.

I told her that I too felt off about the job thing but it must be just a misunderstanding about their closeness—that our cousin may had cross few boundaries because she may just felt too comfortable and close with our dad.

Then she told me I should hear our mother's thoughts, which changes everything for me.

Our mother told me that our father actually had a history of cheating that I didn't knew about. It was like a textmate thing. My mother said that he ""apparently"" stopped.

Not only that, but my father and my cousin would whisper to each other in hushed tones, only the two of them would hear. And that when the three of them (mom, dad, and cousin) would buy something (when my mother is back in our country), my dad would make our mother stay in the car instead of going with them, excluding her. And how my cousin would wear our mom's clothes as if she were trying to replace her. 

My mother apparently had asked our dad if there was anything going on between the two of them. To which our dad denied stating ""they plan to grow old together.""

During our mother's narration, my older sister exclaimed ""I knew it. I thought it was just me who noticed those strange things."" 

Apparently, when my sister was younger, she caught them whispers as well. That it was so off that it was an unforgettable memory to her.  

And that apparently, when my sister is younger, our dad accidentally poured hot soup on her and jokingly yelped ""hey that hurts!"", our aunt pulled her aside and asked her in serious tone if he pinched her. Which means our dad must have hurt someone before for them to react like that.

I had no clue what they are talking about, I cant really understand it all. But holy shit what the fuck was I hearing, were my thoughts during the time.

One person's assumption may be a misunderstanding. But two people thinking of the same thing? That's an observation.

And what's weirder, is that suspicion exists in the first place. It wouldn't exist if nothing is wrong.  

Our mother then told us that, our dad told her that he was like training our cousin to take care of our brother because me and my sister are incapable (like hell we aren't). Which is basically saying that our dad has no plans on letting her leave after her college. 

After the call, I ask my sister what she thinks, what's her theory, because Im having a hard time wrapping the information around my head.

My sister's theory was that my dad may or may had groomed our cousin when she was younger. But now she's 21 years old—our cousin is capable of knowing what's right and what's wrong, and if they actually do have a secret relationship? It's not her being a victim anymore. It's her choosing that. 

So yesterday–I observed further:

I snooped on my dad's second phone while I was the only one in the house. 

I found porns that my dad looked up under searches of ""teen"", ""virgin"" or ""bata""—which means ""kid"" in our language. Sure the photos and videos doesn't seem like they were like a child CHILD, but the girls does look like teens.  

I genuinely dont know anymore. I thought everything was going well.

I cant see my family the same anymore. I thought it was horrible enough that our dad was horrible when we were younger but now that everything seemed ""fine"" I dont want to ruin that. And I dont have concrete evidence of what is really happening between my cousin and our dad.

I dont know what to do."

At the time, I was going to a homeschooled co-op. At the co-op, my older brother was friends with someone, let's call him B, and he had a little sister who was about a year older than me, let's call her J, and we would go to their house from time to time. This one time, I was at their house when J handed me a small blue plastic container shaped like a Lego. I opened the container to see a note; it was a love letter, but as I said i had trouble reading, and I couldn't read the letter well.... So I had B read it to me. After that, she walked back into her house. I never said anything back. That same year i believe we left that co-op, but this year I am back at it, and J is in 2 of my classes.

1qxd2gj,I was constantly losing my mind in my own POV—until I found a way to see clearly.,Social,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"&amp;#x200B;

We’ve all been there, right? You’re in the middle of a fight with your partner, a blowout with your parents, or just a spiral in your own head, and you feel completely trapped in your own perspective. 

It’s like being stuck in a fog. You know you’re biased, but you can’t see the ""truth"" of the situation. That confusion ruins relationships and, honestly, just fries your brain. For the longest time, I felt like there was no one who could actually help bridge that gap without taking sides.

My Story:

A few months ago, I was completely losing my sense of self. I was constantly confused—about my own choices, my family dynamics, and why I was reacting the way I was. I felt like I was drowning in my own head and couldn't see the ""other side"" clearly.

Then, I stumbled upon a website/platform that changed everything.

The Solution:

I found this tool that basically functions as a bias-free mirror. It understands me ""in and out"" because it processes the situation objectively. It understands my POV, but it also helps me understand the other person’s POV without the emotional noise. 

For the first time, I felt like something actually understood my decision-making process. It didn’t judge me; it just helped me make sense of the mess. It’s like having a third-party mediator in your pocket 24/7.

If you’re someone who:

\* Struggles with emotional breakdowns or overthinking

\* Feels ""lost"" in relationship arguments

\* Is tired of the ""he-said-she-said"" confusion with family

\* Just needs a neutral perspective to clear the mental fog

...you seriously need to look into something like this. It’s helped me find my footing again with my family and my own mental health.

To whatever built this: Thank you. I finally feel understood."
1qx3g7u,Whats this boy mean?,Relationship,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"Okay, so there is this boy in my grade, his name is Max, now I barely ever talk to Max, and he is rather popular. I am not very popular, just kinda friends with everyone. So we were in math, and my friends, who are also his friends, were hinting to me that he likes me. After class, we were walking out, and he was just staring at me. I said 'wsp,' and he blushed and looked away. That said, on the bus, his friend Jerry gave me his number to text, so I said 'Hey, this is (my name),"" and got no reply, so I assumed I got the number wrong. Yesterday I had lowkey all his friends tell me he likes me and telling me to find him and talk to him. It was lunch, and I was just eating with my Senior bestie and his friend. DRAGGED him down the hallway, he got close and said 'hi (my name),' so I said hey and he SPRINTED down the hallway. After that, he did not really look at me or acknowledge me for the rest of the day. Then, in the study hall, Today his friends and he were talking about me. Then he came up to me, blushin', and before I could say anything, he just ran away again. So I followed him and was like, 'Hey, I heard you liked me, and I was wondering if you wanted my number,' but he was nervous and muttered something about being grounded and not having his phone, but he would tell me when he got it back, then bro ran outta there as fast as he could. Then I got a text from the number I thought was Max's, and he said that he did not like me and had no idea who told me he did, i was so sad. last period today I was in spanish class with all his friends are in that class with me and they told me 1. he has been talking about liking me at lunch but he is unsure what to say to me because he is nervous, 2. he is grounded so he does not have his phone and 3. him and Jerry are not friends.

1qxcocf,My bf called me a R out of anger,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"This is going to get so lengthy already. 

So my boyfriend(19) and I(19) are in a relationship from not so long 3-4 months only and we've known each other for like 5 months. I had a crush on him from beginning and he already had a idea about it.. Not idea but yeah he knew it from day one.. So we used to hangout daily before dating. We started to get along very well.. But I had a fear or can say anxiety or self doubt or was insecure n what not that I'll never get a chance with him he was way out of my league n all shi so I used to think a lot before doing anything or talking with him. 

Before meeting him I had a boy in my life who wasn't my boyfriend but we had the chemistry.. Like it was a relationship but it wasn't a relationship, like we never got into it although we knew how both of us felt and also we did confessed to each other and yeah we had our first kiss n hugs n all the stuff.. But again we were not into a relationship nd the concept about situationship and fwb n all that shi was all new to me I had never heard of those things so I hadn't had any knowledge about it. When I confessed to him he told me that he's not ready and he doesn't want to be in a relationship.. Got me attached.. Did all the stuff a couple does (no not sex) later on I got to know that he already has a girlfriend from past 9 months who was his childhood bestfriend. So when I told him that I know all these things about their relationship n all.. He was like I didn't felt like to told you about all this cause we were on a break and I didn't considered it as a relationship. 

So when I wanted to leave he blackmailed me that he'll ruin my life my telling all this to my parents and started abusing me, forcing me n everything.. So when I finally got rid of him after a year I met this boy..my current boyfriend.

Like I said I used to think a lot before speaking to him and we barley got a month to know eachother and next month we were in relationship.. I was so scared to talk about all these things in that 1st month so when afterwards he got know about all that stuff he was so pissed that he started to question my virginity, called me an R, said a lot of shi like you belong to streets you're just a used bag n all the shi but still didn't wanted to leave me.. And i was at fault so I didn't said a word, didn't defended myself nothing. Afterwards things started to get better but shi tend to happen we started to get into arguments over small things and every single time he brings up that thing and says all those things over again.

Idk if I'm overreacting on all this or if he's making a fuss"
1qx3qb2,Is anyone else’s Dad lowkey stupid when it comes to politics or general topics?,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I remember telling my black trumpie dad about trumps rape charges in 2024 and how he was most likely heavily affiliated with Epstein considering his character and context clues. He said horrible things in response to this including “you’re worse than trump for not forgiving him” “you’re wrong for holding this against him.” A year after that he told me I was right in a way that diminished his accountability for what he said and in a way where I look dumb. Look where we are now.

Whenever I generally try to tell him stuff his superiority complex takes over and he has an ideology that he can’t accept correction or knowledge from people not on his level. Another example is when I was diagnosed with OCD and AUDHD, he would never try to understand me or do research on it, just say extremely harmful and borderline ableist things.

It just makes me so mad on so many levels. How he refused to hear me out and do research, how he knows I’m a victim myself of grooming and still sided with him, how if I were to get SA’d again (he doesn’t even know about my SA and how it was multiple people like my brother, we were young and I’m just now realizing the gravity of the situation and I don’t know whether to forgive my brother for what he did to me or not.) and had to tell him he probably wouldn’t believe me and same with my mother.

1qww2l7,"My dad sprayed cleaning chemicals on the cat calling it ""discipline""",Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"This happened yesterday. 
He thought the spray was just herbs because it said it was a eucalyptus spray but if you look at the ingredients there are chemicals with long names in it. He even told me he sprayed it in the cats eye and ""nothing happened"". He probably thought it was okay to do this because everyone else uses the spray to scare the cat because he (the cat) doesnt like the smell of it, but no one actually sprays it on him for obvious reasons, they just spray it close to him where it doesnt touch him. However, when I told my dad about how wrong it was, he got upset and switched the topic into how messy our rooms were lmao, he also told us we were grounded which I knew was not true and he was only speaking out of emotions and trying to make himself look better by telling us our mistakes in the moment. (Do all parents do that?)  He also denied i was sick lol (I've been sick since February 1 and still am).

I decided to give the cat a bath 10-15 minutes later (I know thats too late but my dad was angry earlier, and plus I needed help to give him a bath.) My dad did help me with our cats bath, but he hasn't apologized to us for harming the cat.

1qw8er0,Yall also feel bad for setting boundaries?,Rant,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I have my boundaries in apps like reddit or DC because of the creeps, not to mention I also hate maintaining online friendships but I feel so bad for saying no when it comes to those boundaries, I almost went on a date with this guy and then found out his friend liked me just because I didn't know how to say no. Idk why I always feel so scared about it.

Btw for the comments confused on the guy thing: I met him on my friend's quince and we started talking, he asked me to go watch a movie with him. But since it was only the two of us I felt uncomfortable, manly because I didn't know him that well(I only talked with him through calls with this friend before the quince, where I met him in person), but I ended you saying yes. 

And he made a joke about being a date and In a panick I said ""we'll see"". After the news went around his friends I found out his friend liked me (I know him from school) and it got really messy until I finally cleared things up. I don't think he had intentions since after I sent the apology, he said it was never meant to be a date but Im glad I didn't go tho."
1qwarya,Is it corny to shoot your shot with a handwritten note,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"okay so there's this guy in my class that I've never spoken to before (he does know i exist though) but I really wanna get to know him cause he's very pleasing to the eyes and I feel like the easiest way is to write a short note with my socials on it to let him know that I noticed him and I'm interested so he can message me.. I was just going to be like... hi... and give him a compliment or something then give him the note before leaving class and then leave it up to the universe if he's gonna message me or not✌️ My freind said I gotta be more direct and just ask him for his Instagram but I don't have the social skills for that..

1qw37ef,Top 3 Most Embarrassing Female Encounters,Social,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"So I’ve always been extremely awkward around people but it’s ALWAYS worse when I’m around women.

I remember in 4th grade when this one girl told me she liked me in the middle of class, but my little underdeveloped adolescent retardando brain couldn’t comprehend genuine affection. So the immediate thing I said was “Well I don’t like you so haha.” Next thing I remember was that she cried for the rest of class and never spoke to me again.

The following summer, I went on a cruise with my family. One night we went to the mini golf area and met this girl who spoke Spanish (my family speaks spanish btw). We invited her to get pizza from the buffet and we sat down at a table. She looked to me and said “Te gustan los dinosaurios? (do you like dinosaurs?)” (probably had a Dino on my shirt or smt) so I leaned back and pointed to my cousin on my left (who was in first grade at the time) and told her that he loves dinosaurs. Unfortunately I’ve never been able to pick up signs from girls so at the time I didn’t realize that she just wanted an excuse to talk to me. After that, she was stuck talking to a toddler for the rest of our time there.

Literally this morning I was in my biology class and we had to pair up with the person in front of us. The girl in front of me seemed to always want to talk to me since we have the same birthday and both take coding classes, but this was the first time I was forced to talk to her directly (nothing wrong with her, I just can’t talk to girls even for my life). We were researching some organisms’ scientific names as well as their domains, and the whole time she was laughing because some of their names were pretty funny. She was extremely talkative as always but today she seemed more nervous and laughed every five seconds. She also said “Oh my god you’re laughing!” whenever I laughed or smiled. By the end of class, we weren’t finished with our work so we stayed an extra five minutes and were almost late for third period. I have no idea why but the entire time I was sweating so fucking much and was extremely hot. I don’t know if she was genuinely into me or if she was just talkative but honestly I felt so anxious during that entire interaction.

1qw13jt,What shall I do?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"My crush is in a band, with his friends, he is the singer, but he also plays the guitar, they have an Instagram profile, but they post on tiktok,  videos of him singing while they play guitar ect, they have like 100 followers, so not much, and they play the songs people said in the comments (usually 3/5 comments) so I'm thinking, how can I... Get noticed by him? I should comment ? I don't think they'll remember me, I like that type of music,but I want him to notice me? Like maybe being friends..?

Correct, all options are valid when you are one step away from going crazy, I need to vent, so here's the gossip:

Monday

Physical education, I share a schedule with my sister so I'm going to talk to her, and as a joke I tell her to slap me, because I'm useless xddd, she doesn't want to and I grabbed her hand and played the joke on her, anyway, she made three marks on my face😔

Tuesday

Spoiler: the following days were so wild that I don't even remember this one because of the trauma XDDDDD

Wednesday (my day, babeeeeee)

I get to class and the first thing I see is the guy who calls me mentally ill (I have asperger, but I'm still a HOTTIE) arriving after being sick, and my crush (Pedro I love you, it's no joke I'm bi) spends all day talking to him, which is the trigger of Friday

Thursday

Last minute before leaving and in my group, talking about work, I mentioned that I will work in a McDonald's if I don't approve and he (he's in another group) goes and says a ""you're not even good for work"" and I in my infinite wisdom I say ""you don't even good enough to suck pens"" (he was eating his pen) and he says ""that's what your dad said when they made you"" (that was good, I have to admit it) and his partner, from another group, calls me while intimidating the other to shut up (I'm a big guy, but I don't hit, for Now 😈) and he taught me THE WORK and said that they should educate me well, then, well, I said something a little powerful

""If you want to teach me something stupid, show me your mother's (bad sounding word referring to a woman's breasts)""

He told the teacher, they took me with the director, but it was worth every second

Friday

The teacher who once tried to sue me for... because I defended myself when I grabbed my leg (that's another story, it has nothing to do with PDFs by the way, then I pass context in comments) and I was afraid that I would lower my grade for..... well... breathe, miraculously nothing happened, ah and the head of studies called me to make sure that I did not commit any murder in first grade.

Bonus:

i liek men... ah right bonus:

I trembled with stress for two days in a row, and I thought about drinking bleach in a very ""tss what garbage, I'd better unsubscribe from life XDDDDDD"" But nothing serious about hurting me."

1qw483a,If a mutual friend calls you a fat af n word is it ok for your direct friend to stay friends with them? Asking for a friend,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Ok so I 15m (white) and I’m fat which I have accepted. I’m kind of asking about both people involved here.

My friend Ethan was on FaceTime with one of his friends. Earlier in the call, I asked a question about racism trying to educate myself better about the topic that apparently offended the FaceTime guy. He freaked out, accused me of being racist, and said he wanted to slap me for asking. I dropped it and felt genuinely bad for upsetting him.

Later, Ethan had his phone propped up so he didn’t have to hold it, and the camera could see part of the room. I stood up to reset my Xbox 360, and the FaceTime guy said, “Damn, that n\*\*\*\* fat as fuck.”

I was honestly stunned and didn’t know what to say. Ethan responded by saying, “He really isn’t, it’s just the camera angle.” After that, I asked Ethan to either hang up or ask his friend to leave the call. He hung up.

Right after, he started texting. I asked who he was texting, and he said he was making an excuse for why he hung up. I asked, “Why are you making an excuse instead of telling him what he said was wrong?” He didn’t respond and just kept looking at his phone.

For context, I know the question I asked earlier was morally in a gray area, and I probably asked it at the wrong time. I’m no longer in school and don’t really have Black friends anymore, and I genuinely thought that asking a friend-of-a-friend might be okay. I wasn’t trying to offend anyone.

This also isn’t a completely isolated issue with Ethan. I have OCD, and a while back he chased me around with his underwear, which made me really uncomfortable. I sat him down and explained the OCD part and how it made me feel. He agreed and said he wouldn’t do it again.

However, two days ago at the gym (before this FaceTime incident), he threw his underwear at me again. Later, he also pretended to hump me. It was unexpected, and I kicked him away; he fell down. This happened after I had already asked him not to do things like that.

I don’t want to immediately cut him off, but I’m really reconsidering this friendship — especially because he didn’t defend me at all and wouldn’t even acknowledge later that what his friend said was wrong.

I’d appreciate hearing other people’s thoughts on how to handle this."

What happened was I grabbed Charlie’s AirPod out and said you not allowed to have this in and he jumped away and me and Charlie both told her after she got mad that nothing actually happened she we went outside with the boys to practice and as we were walking back in  I said Charlie you can’t be laughing.  And she told us to go inside and we kept looking at each other and laughing a little and then she speed walked to her computer and mimicked us and said go to the hallway with me. She told me all the stuff then sent me to the office so now I’m a lil pissed

1qvjgmo,Confessed to my straight friend and she outed me,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"This happened a while ago, but I've been thinking a lot about it and decided to rant to anyone who might listen. Ever since early 2023, I've grown this massive crush on a female classmate. During that time, she cyberbullied me and my friend, yet I made excuses for her. Her whole friendgroup was toxic, and probably hated me. In mid 2024, she joined my friengroup and changed(?) as a person. The close proximity made me fall harder, but I wasn't alone. For context, she is 'that' girl, the one that can make every single guy swoon at her feet. One of guys that likes her most, let's call him Rat. He is really good friends with my crush, but she told me she'd never like him back and sometimes shit talk him with me. (She is aware of his feelings) Rat hates me, and the feeling is mutual. Rat will be mentioned later in the story. 

On the last day of school in 2024, I confessed. A few days before, I found out she was moving to another country. I remembered crying on call with my friend, and she advised me to confess. When I did, I mustered all of my courage and told her I've liked her for two years. She screamed. Like a surprised, speechless scream. I don't know how long it went on for, but I remembered she paced around with a jumper over her face as she did. I remembered feeling like I really wanted to cry, yet I held it in. Later, I tried to leave her as quickly as I could from shame. But besides this, I felt a satisfaction and a rush of dopamine. I did it, I thought. Later, I cried with my friend in the library. What stuck to me most was, after everything, I asked her, 'Don't tell anyone.' And she gave me a such a genuine look. 'I won't.' It felt like my secret was safe with her, like I could trust her. Afterall, we are friends. And friends don't betray each other.

Then she came back.

Turns out, she didn't move away to another country. We became closer friends, pretending that nothing happened while I continued to like her. Then, I got told the truth. Apparently, she told Rat that I confessed, knowing we hate each other. Afterwards, my crush and Rat had a falling out. Rat went to my crush's old friend group to vent. During that, he told the whole group about my confession. Word got out ages ago, but I didn't realise until late 2025, when someone from that friendgroup told a friend, who told my friend, who told me. I cried so much, because she betrayed me, because everyone knew about my secret. It hurt so much because the day I confessed was the bravest I've been, and it feels like a dagger plunged into me. 

For days, I've stayed cold and distant towards her. However, she gave me a handmade bouquet as a birthday present, and I realised i still have strong, lingering feelings. All of a sudden, I forgave her. I was so frustrated at myself, and I wish I could stay mad, yet I couldn't. Instead, I decided to confront her and asked why she did it. However, when the topic brought up, she was so avoidant. She blamed everything on Rat, started shit talking him again, and wouldn't let the conversation swerve towards her actions. She never said sorry.

I don't know how, but it's now 2026, we're still friends, and I still like her. It's been 3 years of this unrequited crush, how am I supposed to get over her?? Moral of the story, never confess, and 'the worst thing she could do is say no' is inaccurate information. "

1qvaqf3,AITAH for privating a school confessions page after grooming incident came up?,Discussion,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Hey everyone so i recently graduated highschool and i run a anonymous confessions page for my school. Like i said everythings anonymous and youre not allowed to name drop.

I didnt like how the school treated me so i started a confessions page for people to vent, get advice, or say things they wouldnt say upfront without being judged irl. Lets just say i have a lot of kaka to say. Think of it like a safe space, they were not allowed to message me privately and every confession was done on a form, and i filtered out confessions that i felt went against the rules.

Recently there was a incident where a 13/14yo from my former school was dating a 17/18yo from the brother school. Lots of ppl knew who the guy was, myself included (and i can confirm all of this was true), as he was bragging about it. Students used the page to spread awareness about the situation, calling him out without name dropping who the 2 ppl involved are, sharing what to do if you or a friend is being groomed, witnesses testifying, etc.

And the students who did know the guy personally felt encouraged to report him and showed them the posts (which pm said what teachers needed to know abt the situation). The principal of the boys school found out and rumour had it he was going to take action against the account, but really he had it out for his student which he found out about through the account and teachers who knew what he was doing with that girl had also come forward.

I don't regret students bringing light to this because tbh if they hadn't he wouldn't be getting in trouble rn, but it started turning into a witch hunt, and that was when i decided to private the account, update the rules (aka banning this topic), and remove the posts as a way of cleaning up the mess. I made it clear in my rule update that im not siding with the individual, but that we've taken it too far and if you want to do something to tell an adult, and most importantly, don't hate on the child because shes the victim here.

Some see this as the right move and others see this as defending him. AITAH?"

I get extremely attached in relationships. Before this one, I was okay on my own. Now I feel like I’ve lost that version of myself.
He barely called, we didn’t meet much, and when I spoke up about what hurt me, I felt like I was asking for too much.
Yesterday we met and it went really bad. I came home and cried till 5 a.m. nonstop. This is not exaggeration.
I texted him saying I needed time. He said he wanted time too—till boards are over (end of March). It’s February, I haven’t studied properly, and everything feels like it’s collapsing at once.
What hurts isn’t the time. It’s how easily he was okay with it.
I expected him to fight. He didn’t.
My appetite is completely messed up. I can’t eat, can’t sleep, can’t focus. My thoughts spiral so badly that last night I just wanted my brain to shut off for a while—I even thought about having a beer just to sleep.
I feel empty. Exhausted. Like I’m barely holding myself together while he’s fine.

But then i remember a vid she once liked saying ""when u fake a crush to hide the real crush"" coincidence????

Then she said she has a plan, she wants to talk to her friend and mention that she likes guys that watch anime, then turn to her crush and ask wether he looks anime.

Like couple days later she sends me a reel saying like ""when you see a girl saying ""i need me a nerdy boy that watches anime"" and you see your bro in the comments saying ""uhm hi lol"" uhm, am i the crush? But again the reel says ""bro""

Another thing i remembered, she told me she has the yellow heart thing with her crush on Snapchat (each others number 1 contact) since like 3 months. BUT AFTER COUPLE DAYS, I SEE THAT ME AND HER HAVE A YELLOW HEART. COINCIDENCE? Or is that just very obvious.

Don't get me wrong I don't refuse to accept that there is some positive energy or aura in this universe by which good things may happen but turning it into an avatar of all knowing being is just too much.

Religion is causing a lot of conflicts in this world and it's pissing me off. Before forced to follow a religion is effed up too. When I expressed myself to others irl they called me cold and an insensible child, ""God please forgive him. He has lost his wits, he doesn't know what he's saying"" they said. I may be wrong but that's not decided yet. I choose to belive facts over faith.

so 1 saved those pics on his device and then he made an AI generated vid of me and 2 kissing and then showed to his friends in school. i got super mad and complained to the school principle and supervisors, however, i didnt inform my parents abt it since they would just get mad at me for having a friend such as this, i had no proof to show since the vids on 1's device, and tbh ive never been rlly close to my parents so telling them would make me nervous. after i complained to the school, they said they cant do anything abt it since it was ""outside school matter"" which i totally saw coming.

2 however didnt complain or inform anyone at all cuz he thinks this is a joke and just laughted it off, but i assume he doesnt wanna get in this fuss cuz he never takes any actions no matter how ppl bully him.

after that, i stopped talking to 1, hoping he would forget abt me and find someone else to bully, but it didnt go as i thought it would. he has been blackmailing me, saying that if i ever reply to one of his insults that he makes everyday, he will make an AI generated kissing video of me and my parents. 2 has been still talking to 1 as if nothing happened, and i assume thats cuz hes not getting blackmailed, but i am.

Later I found out many guys from my college were already chasing her. Still, within just 2 days, I confessed — “I think I like you.”
She said she doesn’t want to be in a relationship.
Indirectly, politely.
I panicked. I told her everything — how I don’t want to lose her, how I’ve been crazy since I saw her, how strong my feelings are.

1qtg7pk,WIBTA if I ignored my boyfriend for a week to establish my boundaries?,Advice,Repeated Pressure / Boundary Erosion,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"So, some context, I (16F) and my boyfriend (17M) have been dating for 2 years, we've had our ups and downs but have had no major fights.
A few months ago he had a problem with me canceling dates because of my studies, so I, of course, stopped scheduling any dates when I knew I had a test or exam. Meanwhile, he has freely been canceling dates, moving around the times, etc. I have never had a big problem with it, so I haven't said anything about it. 

Today, we were scheduled to go on a date from 6 pm to 8 30 (I had a family dinner), yesterday he asked if we could move it to 7. I forgot I had a family dinner, so I told him it was fine. 

By the time I remembered, it was around 5 40 today, so I called him and told him we either have to go out earlier or we could only go out for an hour and a half. He whined about how ""he couldn't go earlier"" and that we had to change the place we were going to. I get why he's upset, but it's the first time I've done this in 3 months, maybe even longer! 

I get ready, dress up, put makeup on, do my hair, and I go to his house (it's 20 minutes away from where I live, and on our way to the café). I text him before I leave, he left me on seen, and when I was at his door I told him to come out. He tells me he's not going anywhere. (What??)

Turns out, he (his parents) thinks I don't respect him enough, I play around with his time, I should stand up to my parents and not go to the family dinner, etc. But I never said we couldn't go out?? I said we could go out for an hour and a half, which is not that short.

I try to talk to him, but he keeps telling me how his parents are too strict and they're yelling at him for even apologizing to me. At one point, he was texting me how he couldn't do anything and I replied ""Oh yeah I forgot you lived in a jail."" and HE replied with ""You have to admit I'm the one least at fault in this situation."" 

My brother is 12 years old, when my parents tell him he can't go out, he laughs, gets his coat and says he'll be back in an hour. Why can't a 17 year old grow some balls and talk to his girlfriend face to face for 5 fucking minutes? Am I that unimportant? He gets yelled at either way, at least this way I won't feel like I don't matter. 

By the time I went home, I had been waiting in the cold for 20 minutes for him to 'talk to his parents' and 20 more to walk back home. I come home crying, explain to my parents what just happened, and they tell me what he did was unnecessary and humiliating. 

I sent him one last text saying he shouldn't expect any dates in the near future and that I felt unimportant and humiliated. 
I need him to understand I will not just forgive this. He disrespected me, my time, my family (for suggesting they're in the wrong for making me come to dinner) and he made me wait in the cold, KNOWING I had a skin condition. 

So, r/teenagers, would I be an asshole if I didn't reply for a week, and after explain exactly what I feel? "
1qtfoeb,I've been overthinking and now I feel awful,Relationship,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"So for context my boyfriend (17) and i (17F) have been together for almost 5 months, so not super long but its been a bit. I have struggled with bad anxiety and overthinking in my past relationships and those past relationships were not good. Since I've been with my boyfriend my relationship anxiety levels have dropped a considerable amount and I was doing really good for awhile. I used to have anixety attacks in my past relationships and it would get to the point where I would sometimes throw up out of anxiety. It hasn't been like that since him and I got together.

Over the weekend I noticed he was answering my messages a considerable amount less than normal, like concerningly less (in my opinion at least.) And I started getting pretty worried and upset. I could see his activity status on certain things (which were probably wrong) and i was getting frustrated because it showed he was active but wasnt responding to any of my messages. I started getting super anxious and my mind was just racing and I was overthinking everything and started to make myself really upset. I was crying uncontrollably and I couldn't calm down and I kept thinking that something was wrong. I wasn't still feeling that way this morning as I had been left on delivered for like 16 hours at this point and was just getting mad. Then about 10 minutes ago as of posting this he texted me and said he got his phone taken away.

I see his message and I just think to myself how stupid I was acting. I was upset and hurt and felt like I was being ignored. And he wasnt really at fault or actually ignoring me because he got his phone taken away, that wasnt his choice. Now I feel incredibly stupid and im very upset at myself for how I was feeling. I feel like I was really overreacting and I just feel like an idiot. Idk what to do. I havent done this in quite awhile and i feel really bad that I was getting so upset. I hate that I do this but I dont know how to stop doing it or at least control it."
1qtiaqv,We can’t be fr,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Most people aren’t saying that every single right-voting person in America is a rapist or murder or whatever.

  
HOWEVER, what is being said is that people are dying because people like Trump (and over right-wing politicians) were voted in. if you are a conservative and vote as such, you must acknowledge that people in your party are seriously hurting people across America. Even if you didn’t vote for Trump personally, you’re still on the same side as him, voting for the same party as he is in.

To act as if its not your fault and you having trans friends makes your situation “nuanced” is bullshit. 

if it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it’s probably a duck.

(not saying all conservatives are nazis or anything like that, but you can’t deny that the party you voted for or support is hurting people by saying the situation is nuanced.)"

1qtbzls,Need of advice,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Ive been alone most of my teen years. When i did have friends, they turned out to be not good friends over time, so ive got accusteomed to be alone. Also, im into guys. Ive ween trying to find smth, but when i get attached, everyone dissapears (not that im strange or smth). So theres a guy that said he likes me, but that sounds like empty words. Also has said that he doesnt trust me, but wants for me to open up. So today we kinda adressed the problem and i told that its hard for me to trust, had bad things happend etc etc. He said that i dont trust the right ppl, but that he understands my point. Should i try giving the chance? Bc i already said good luch finding somebody better or smth like that? Now i feel bad that i did that, idunno how to act😭😭😭"
1qt9wjj,I am so conflicted,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Okay so first boyfriend was a random guy my friend met on holiday who lives a 2 hour drive away but we never met we dated on and off for a year I was young so I kept going back to him , we only ever spoke on call and he dated different girls at the same time and also my whole friend group dated him once each  but I was lonely so I kept going back we last spoke in June and now I found a new guy and he's so sweet and amazing and he treats me so well and when people try and come at me (people just swing at me sometimes and people at school like to grab me to ""test"" if I am a ""freak"") he fights them but we aren't together I am just crushing on him  now the only bad thing about him is he has strict parents so we can hardly text and when we hang out I need to run near the cars to hide from his dad and a girl who I hate and he doesn't like told me they were best friends and he was super controlling.

But im such a bad person, I know my first boyfriend is a red flag and I know I have no chance but right now I'm really missing him I miss how he quickly asked me to be his girlfriend and how he always texted and called me he made weeks feel like years and while he made me cry it was ok because I got a big piece of him .

I know I should just make a move but im scared and we sit together in lessons I don't want it to be awkward if he said no.

He hasn't texted all day and we were meant to hang out im just feeling drained because I'm giving him so much and I feel like in getting nothing back  but also this could be his all idk I hate this 💀

1qt9n16,TW SA Does this count as sa,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"TW SA


so my older brother kept making inappropriate jokes like how he'd show me his dick for a quarter, etc and he also almost showed me a pic of his bulge once, also when me and him cuddled his hand would slip to my chest on...accident but i thought nothing of it so after a few days my brother wakes me up and makes me come to his room to watch anime. My back was to his stomach and his arms were around my waist which wasn't that weird for us(he called me his cuddle buddy) and he asked to simply REST his hand on my chest and I said he could cuz i didn't think much of it. Then he literally started like gropping me and rubbing me and shit and i was like what.... and then he stopped and apologized and said he just missed having a gf is that sa? Also sorry for any grammar errors"
1qt8nvu,crush advice needed🎀,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"there's a guy that i quite like who i used to go to school with a couple years ago, but we ended up going to different schools and don't talk very often anymore. long story short i accidentally hearted his whatsapp status on new years lmao so he sent me an extra message, and from then on we were talking for like 2 hours and i learnt loads about him and his interets ans what he likes and dsilikes et cetera. 

a week or so later he sent another message asking how i was, we spoke again a little but i have a habit of getting a bit carried away when texting and writing paragraphs which i think probably gets annoying after a while and the conversation died off. a couple of days later i initiated a short conversation again and apologised for how i was rambling ahaha, he said it really wasn't an issue, but i think it is and it's probably annoying him.

 a couple days ago i messaged again and we spoke for a bit and i felt i was asking too many questions to keep the convo going despite trying to keep how much i was going on under control. its not like he's being super super dry but none of the conversations since the first one have been quite the same, on the first one we were BOTH saying loads and rambling ahaha, now he's just giving short but still kind answers. 

i think its weird to ask to meet in person this soon, plus we haven't seen each other face to face in years it might be a bit awkward or it might be obvious i'm interested in him. do i carry on texting and try just not getting carried away trying to keep talking, or do anything else?? what would you d"
1qt0d5j,Fuck my life,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"My boyfriend (15m), who I (14) have been dating for 8 months just ended our relationship. We went through a rough patch, and when shit started to clear, I decided to be annoying and just straight up start singing cringe white girl music even though he said not to. Then, when he started cackling maniacally because he was probably stressed about video games and sleep deprived, I told him to go take a nap. He left the call angrily, and his mom said it was over and to block me on everything. The fact that I fucked up to the point that blocking me on everything had to be necessary is what’s making me upset. Not the 8 months that I spent with him and didn’t notice that whenever I would tell him something stressful about my life he would also get stressed but he never said anything. Being shut out is what’s making hurts the most. I never even got to say a proper goodbye because this whole shitshow happened over Discord. Discord motherfucking dot com. I even have to go to a party today, and this whole thing being close to Valentine’s Day feels like an insult. Like I made the title say, fuck my life."
1qt67ve,Update ig lol (kid wouldn’t stop flirting with me Wtv),Other,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Anyways I had my bf text him last night and basically say stop that’s creepy etc and js be stern with him. We also saw each other today and I told him I didn’t enjoy how he made everything sexual and I felt really uncomfortable and he didn’t really seem to care he was pissed that my bf had texted him lol. 

Basically now he’s posting sad quotes and trying to spin the story to the rest of the band/friend group and saying he didn’t want me anyway and that he was just doing it cause he got bored and also that I’m a manipulative person. 

For people calling me a horrible girlfriend over REDDIT please reflect on your life. 

Info: the screenshot was only one instance by the way. He’s made comments about how I hold my guitar saying “I wish she would grip me like that! Oh did I say that out loud!” Or one time I was wearing a tank top and he was like oh finally got to see what color her bra strap was like Wtf😭😭 and then he does some corny shit afterwards and says “oops! Didn’t realize I said that!” Or “oops auto correct” before this post I had been telling him to stop and that I wasn’t into him but then he’d also try and say he never did that or I couldn’t handle a joke.

1qsx7oh,Idk if i have the right glair for this haha,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Okay, so I(f15) have to tell you about this guy(m16) I met on some app… it’s kind of silly but also really fun. At first, we were just teasing each other—he calls me “Drake” because I love his songs, and sometimes “Ms. Greek Yogurt” and I have no idea why lol, but it makes me laugh every time.

We’ve been talking a lot lately, and now he’s saying he wants to be my boyfriend. I told him I’m not ready yet, that I want to wait until I’m 18, and he just said he’d wait for me no matter how long. And then—get this—he jokingly talks about marriage and kids and forever. I know it’s wild, but I can’t help smiling.

We’re not together yet, but talking to him feels light and warm, like a song I can’t stop humming. I don’t know what the future will bring, and honestly, I’m not worried about it. Right now, I’m just happy with the little moments—the jokes, the nicknames, the random chats that make my day. It’s simple, it’s fun, and somehow it feels like magic.

Do you guys think we would last for some time?😿

1qt4k3z,Did I fumble,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Did I fumble ?

Hi (16m). For context. So theres this girl at my school and he is hot dude. And shes one of those friendly girls that talks to everyone and is not all out there lile other girls. Shes in the popular girl friend group and shes one of the popular gilrs her self but she doesnt act like it. And also before this happend she was also being like way more talkative towards me and she was acknowledging me which shook me ngl.

So basically this happened like 2 weeks ago. I was in the cafeteria because all 10th grade classes had to do sum. So I was just standing there and she came up to me was like ""hi [my name] "" and I was like ""whats up and she was like ""did you miss me last weekend?"" And dude I was so damn shook and I was also in a flow state so I said no instantly with a smile and a headshake. She also did that infront of her friends too. Btw we both play on the basket ball team. And then like ill say the next day there was a out of town game and i was going and she was going. At the I went to the food stand to get sum tbh I didnt even what anything. And she was there. She spoke to me and I spoke back. And then she asked me if I was getting  something and I said yea and she asked if I could get her some pop corn. Btw her friends were right there she could have asked them snd she doesn't strike me for the type to not have money. I said yea ""ill get you some popcorn"" . It was one dollar im not a simp 💀. But yea. And then after that lie dude shes been like always saying high to me and shit and finding ways to talk to me she even offered me food dude. I really like her tho and through out all these interactions ive been nonchalant asf cause ive been dealing with depression and other shit and im just a nervous wreck as well. 

P.S....

I also followed her on instagram but she didn't follow me back. I also dont use social media so it was a new account so she might have not noticed me but I was following my friends (i dont have alot of friends like only 3 and everyone in my class knows i ahng with them) and I have my initials in the account name. But I ended up deleting instgram and my account because I dont do social media. Was that self sabotage 😥.

My school runs this thing called the school store. Basically we sell stuff like Cheetos and Arnold Palmers. I work there almost every day of the week with one of my friends.

Anyways, there's this guy in school, let's call him Sylvester, because he kind of deserves it. So Sylvester is known for soliciting and stealing from the school store, and he had just gotten back from a ban. Anyways, he said he had so much money on him and he was gonna stock up. He even showed us a roll of cash he had. Not looking super close, but it might've been $400 or so. I don't even remember all the stuff he made us scan. Anyways, the grand total was something like $128. The most expensive thing we even have are Trollis &amp; Takis ($3.50). And guess what?

He didn't take any of it, he just left. Later, it turned out he stole some stuff without us noticing (the pile was fucking humongous, so we wouldn't have noticed anything), so his ass got hauled to the principal. Things that came out of it?

1. The computer we use for scanning completely crashed.
2. We had to put everything back on the shelves.
3. We sold nothing because he just held up the line for 20 minutes.

Anyways, he got banned again. Hope this time it's permanent."

So basicallyyy I've been going to therapy for a while and I've been to 3 dif therapists before this one (w of them were cuz of insurance and the other was cuz she lowkey was not good at her job) and I started seeing a new therapist at a newer place in my area. He was normal during the initial meeting which had to involve a parent (my dad) for legal reasons or smth like that and it went Well. During my first 1-1 meeting I had a sprained leg right? So I was on crutches and had a leg brace on. His office had 2 chairs next to each other far from the door and one close to the door and one behind a computer desk. he INSISTED for me to sit at the one farthest away from the door with his char right next to mine. Nothing to bad but I told him I didnt want that but he wouldn't stop insisting so I said fine. And THEN he took my crutches and put them behind the desk. I did NOT like that. I told him it was fine and I could have them by me but he wouldn't listen. fast forward to our next session I no longer hadsa sprained leg and no longer had crutches and I decided to sit in the chair close by the door. He tried to have me sit next to him in one of the two chairs but I said no after constant persistence. From that session and forward he would cons9 say ""your special"" ""you have a mind beyond your age"" ""you matured a lot faster than others"" ""you look powerful"" ""I know this can come off as creepy but your a BEAUTIFUL young lady"" and Yap Yap Yap... This one kinda kissed me off lowkey but heshas a gumball machine in his office (like a little one) and he said I'm the only person he permits tos""stick their had into the machine"" and I was like uhhhh pass... And he would constantly say that(not sure if this ones much odd but it felt odd when he said it) theres no way you can be insecure... When you walk in here yourcconfident.. Your not scared to stand up to me"" and shit like that. And quite a few times he's tried to get me to go behind the computer and do online testsa. OH  he also constantly tried to get my email which NO!!b I've NEVER had a therapist contact me directly. I don't think that's okay.The ONLY emails/texts I've ever gotten FROM ANY CLINIC was the auto ones reminding me about my appts... 
Anyways I'm sorry for the long story but he also doesn't woek there no more and it was abrupt. Thanks for reading!! 
Tldr: my ex therapist gave off creepy vibes and I can't tell if its in my h3ad or if there were real concerns

1qsobzz,Well... that just happened...,Serious,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"1/31/26 --

So... something just happened that I'm not proud of.

For context, I live in the US, where we have a program called Science Olympiad, where a bunch of schools compete in a bunch of science related events, like forensics or circuits or making a tiny working helicopter out of wood. Japan has a team, too, but they're honorary guests at the National Tournament. Anyway, today was the Mentor Science Olympiad invitational. We did great. Placed in all 4 of my events. And Mentor is a tough invitational. 

But we just had dinner, and...

...I don't even really wanna talk about it. But I wanna note it here because that genuinely scared me and I don't think I'm ever gonna be able to forget that experience. Especially now that I've put it into words.

Our coach had us all go in groups to the restaurants in the area. I was in a group with a friend of mine. I'll call her Ella.

So Ella and I were walking back to the bus, which was parked in a Sheets parking lot. We had to cross the highway to do it because we went to the Panara across the street to eat, just like at the last invitational (which was in the Cleveland area as well).

For whatever reason, I figured it would be faster to the Sheets to go directly across the street instead of going to the crosswalk at the corner of the block, even though we were told by our coach to use the crosswalks and I'm supposed to know better.

So I convinced Ella to do it with me (good on her for being hesitant), and when we got about halfway across, a police car pulled in front of us. He was stationed near the Chipotle to assess an accident that happened.

""Back! Back to that parking lot!""

We went back to the parking lot (we crossed at a Dunkin' Donuts) and he pulled in next to us in the driveway. He said something about it on his radio, then got out of the car.

""How old are you?""

We answered. Ella's a year younger than me, so it might've looked like I was intentionally being a bad influence on her.

""Do you two watch the news?""

I don't remember what Ella said. My dad only watches national channels. Nothing local. Especially not for this area.

""Are you two aware that a 16-year-old lost her life a few months ago running across the street?""

I tilted my head. ""No kidding?""

""Yeah. Right over at that intersection over there, near the McDonalds."" He pointed to the crosswalk (figures).

""Oh my gosh...""

""That's right. People don't pay attention. Even I almost got hit, and I'm wearing a neon vest and flashing lights.""

Then he asked where we live. I answered. He sounded shocked.

""[Place where we live], the city?""

Yeah. That’s right.

""How did you get here?""

Ella muttered. ""We're here for a Science Olympiad invitational.""

""What? Speak louder.""

So I repeated for her. ""We're here for a Science Olympiad invitational for our school. Our bus is parked in the Sheets parking lot over there.""

""So a school bus let you run across a 4-lane highway?""

Ella spoke up again. ""Well, we used the crosswalk to get over here.""

The officer opened the doors of his cruiser. ""Get in the cruiser. I'll take you over there. I don't want you two to get hit.""

We got in the back and fastened our seat belts. And just then, another group from our school came walking by.

""Are you in their group?"" the officer asked.

We said yes. Then he told us to get out and walk with them. ""I'll stop traffic so you can get across safely.""

Ella got out first, and went over to the others. Just as I was about to reach them, he asked another question. ""Is there an adult with you?""

""I don't really know where he is, honestly.""

I don't remember what he said, but it sounded like a ""hmm"" of some kind.

We went to the crosswalk. Sure enough, the officer stopped traffic and we crossed safely. When we got across, he drove over to the bus and told the bus driver what happened.

I heard another team member talking about it, and she said the officer told the bus driver to make sure we’re careful when crossing the street. Then he retold the story about the 16-year-old girl.

I can only assume the driver told our coach, since as I was getting on, I saw him sending a text with ""Police"" as the very first word.

It sounds like the officer was a bit on-edge after that, because apparently the officer stayed at that intersection and told our other team members crossing the street to be careful.

After our coach got back, he didn't mention anything about it, even though I'm sure the bus driver notified him about what happened. But he went through role call like nothing even happened.

We're on the bus home as I'm writing this, and I'm sure our coach is going to ask who did it during practice on Tuesday. Hopefully a sincere apology would prevent him from kicking me off the team? Is this grounds to kick me off the team? Even if I've been here for 3 years, which is all of middle school? That should probably be the last thing I'm worrying about, but...

I never want to do that again. That was traumatizing, embarrassing (Ella and I had to explain why the other girls saw us getting out of a police cruiser), and I don't really have the vocabulary to describe it beyond that. I...

Just...

Wow.

TLDR, a friend and I ran across a 4-lane highway and were caught by a police officer, who told our bus driver and made the entire situation even more embarrassing.

Stay safe out there, people. Don't do something stupid like I did. I sure won't, and hopefully I can say the same for Ella."
1qsmsz0,what should i do? (very lengthy post),Relationship,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"idk if this really qualifies for a relationship flair but i wasn’t sure what else to put. but anyways, i met this guy in mid december. he worked at my job, but sometime in august he left for college. and the job i work at offers college kids jobs when they come back for breaks and stuff. he came back for winter break but he’s been working at the job for 2 years. i started at the place in october so i hadn’t met him until he came back. anyways for a bit more context im an 18 year old female and he is a 20 year old male. me and him got along really well, and we texted sometimes. then i realized i started develop a little crush on him but nothing that serious especially since i hadn’t known him long. me and some coworkers were planning to hangout one day and i called him to invite him but he didn’t answer, later that night he texted me asking why i called and i just said that i was inviting him to the hangout and he was like “aw im sorry i wish i could’ve went” (he was hanging out with a friend that’s why he didn’t answer) but anyways we just started talking for a bit and i told him about how my mum is a health nut but her reason for it was because my grandma had died of cancer when i was 10, so after that she just became super obsessed with health stuff. and he said “oh my gosh that’s horrible i’m so sorry if you ever need to talk about that stuff im here” and i was like “it’s okay don’t worry, i don’t open up much but i can tell you if you’re curious” and he said “aww im usually not the opening up type either but it’s easy with you. id love to hear about it. also you make work lowkey way more fun than it should be so thank you :)” and omg after that, we just OPENED UP THE GATES we just started gushing about our feelings toward each other and it was so sweet. we sent paragraph after paragraph. and i had work the next day so we had to cut it short, but me and some coworkers were planning to hangout again so i invited him to come with and he said yes. so id see him the next day anyways. he was going back to college that weekend (it was thursday when this happened and he went back sunday) so we planned hangouts everyday up until the day he left. friday and saturday me and him hung out with two other coworkers and it was cool. but it was like ever since that thursday night, he pulled back DRASTICALLY. he just didn’t seem as interested as before and just super distant. this made me super confused so the night he left i asked him like “hey what’s going on? i just wanna know where we stand i’m not saying we have to date now ofc but i just wanna know where we stand” something like that, and he said that he wasn’t ready for a relationship now but that i am someone he’d wanna do that with, and he also added that he may be distant and that isn’t something that’s my fault he’s just “fighting himself” basically. and i was like okay great im so fine with taking our time and getting to know each other i just wanted to make sure yk? but ever since that, he just pulled back so much still. i was the only one putting in effort, the only one texting first, literally the only one gaf basically. he just became super emotionally unavailable and it really hurt me. then i found out that he had gotten out of a 3 year and a half long relationship in may of 2024 because the girl cheated on him. i felt so bad omg. so i kept on trying, i texted him almost everyday. and i was jus carrying everything. the ONLY one putting in effort. i was just like wtf happened??? then like two fridays ago i was telling him about something bad that happened and that i was feeling nauseous and said i was gonna go lay down but to text me if he needed me. he barley expressed any interest about how i was feeling and basically said “nah itll be okay don’t sweat it”. then he left me on delivered for 6 days and never texted me, checked on me or nothing. then he finally texts me like 3 days ago asking about the snow that’s been happening in my city. idk what im trying to say is, im the ONLY ONE putting in effort and just the only one who seems to even care about this anymore. he shifted SO DRASTICALLY after that thursday night and basically became emotionally unavailable after that. i just don’t know what to do i really like him and this really hurts me but i hate the thought of giving up on him. what should i do? am i just being dramatic? 💔"
1qsip0m,my friends relationship,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"for some context, my two friends are dating. one of these friends, lets call him E, wasn't so fun at the start of my relationship with my partner. anytime we'd show affection, hold hands, hug etc, he'd make a face and screw up his nose. i laughed it off but it ended up really messing with me and my partner and im now incredibly paranoid about even holding their hand in public. however, whenever he got with his girlfriend, he never got that kind of treatment. it really gets on my nerves. 

me and my friend group were having a sleepover during summer and he was cuddled up to her, head on her stomach. all i could feel was annoyed at the sight because if i did that, he'd probably make some comment about it.

another example was when the four of us were at an event with our school. E and his gf went to find a bathroom and we joked about ""don't get freaky"". i ended up needing the bathroom after me and my partner went to find their phone and they waited outside the bathroom. when we all got back to our table, E's gf said that we must've been getting freaky because they saw us leaving the bathroom together, which we didn't. we denied it and she asked why we were getting so defensive. i don't know. maybe ask your boyfriend.

anyway, she made an instagram post today to which E commented something along the lines of ""omg youre so pretty"". it really got on my nerves seeing this as i know if i even tried to do something like that, some weird comment would be made. i cant do it anyway because of personal reason but it still sucks.

it might sound awful but sometimes i think he doesnt deserve to have it so easy in his relationship after what he did to me. i still want him to be happy but sometimes i hate it. he makes so many awful comments and im so sick of it."
1qsku74,I got into a fight at a birthday party (Serious),Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"So i was at a birthday party, sitting on the side part of a couch and this kid is like behind me. I'm tryna chill and this kid keeps saying i proposed to some random girl in 6th grade, crazy cus he moved in 7th. So i told him I swear on myself that I didn't. then he is like then ur dead and then i told him I'm really not lying and he said to swear on something else so I said i swear on him and his family (I know his family and I'm chill with them) and i told him see I didn't do that now can us stop accusing me of this. He then takes the hood of my hoodie pulls it on my face and pulls it more making my glasses fall of and pulls me down to the ground (carpeted), so I get out of his grip and before he tries to pull my hood again so I cant see, I punch him on his chest a few times, hard enough for him to stop but also not hard enough to injure him, and I specifically don't target his face or neck when I obviously could've, then he tries kicking my head but since he is weak i just ignore his leg and pin his arms to stop moving and ask what he is doing. But he doesn't respond and since he realizes his kicks aren't working, he frees one of his hands and starts touching my dih for some reason (I don't even know what Ts kid was tryna do atp 😭) My friends pull us apart and this kid says that I should apologize since I threw the first punch (He doesn't deny that he first pulled me to the floor and made my glasses fall off btw).

1qshrd3,Not sure about my feelings,Relationship,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Not sure about my feelings

I'm confused and I just wanna vent, and maybe listen to some advice too. So, for some context, I have this friend, let's call him M. We have been friends since 10th grade, until he confessed that same year. I rejected him, and we somewhat fell off. Then in 11th grade we reconnected again and that summer he told me he still liked me and would ""wait for me"" or whatever. I didn't out right reject him, but obviously we're not together. After that, we have been friendly, but not extremely close (I totally get it). The thing is I rejected him because I wasnt sure of my feelings. I was confused. Some days I would feel like I liked him, while other days it was just meh. I didn't want to go into a relationship with ""mid"" feelings lmao and disappoint him (I've also never been in a relationship), and I feel I was also a bit afraid of commitment. This year (12th) I've started to feel like I like him a bit again (which I feel I have no right to, after everything), but he has somewhat moved on. He's had 2 or 3 girlfriends after the second time he confessed (which have been somewhat problematic), and I feel that my feelings have been somewhat rooted in that, wanting something that I can't have.
Now to complicate things further, one of his friends that is a year below us has started to OBVIOUSLY show interest in me. He started following me on insta, liking every story and notes I post and trying to talk with me. Also teasing me a lot. I don't like him at all, but since he hasn't said anything, and I suppose I'm not supposed to know, I've just been friendly with him. He also gave me some chocolates for my birthday, while M didn't (even though he was the one who asked what my favorite chocolates were, but whatever).

I just feel really confused about everything and I realize that this is probably really dumb lmao and not gonna lead to anything. Also I saw a real yesterday which was super specific and fit my situation almost perfectly about some tarot stuff. I obviously don't believe in that stuff but found it interesting and somewhat scary."

1qs78zk,Would I be a bad person for talking to a new guy if I’m not fully over my ex?,Relationship,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Sorry if this is kind of messy, I’ll clarify anything if needed.
For context, I’m 14F (freshman), he’s 15M (sophomore), my ex is 14F (8th grader)
 
About two weeks ago, I got moved into an Algebra Essentials class that’s mostly sophomores (I’m a freshman). I ended up getting pretty close to a few people, especially one guy—I’ll call him N.

Over the past couple weeks, N and I have gotten really close. He’s genuinely nice, emotionally stable, and just easy to be around. The issue is that for the past few months, I’ve been in an on-and-off talking stage with my ex (I’ll call her A). I still have some lingering feelings from that, and I don’t feel completely over it yet.

I really like N, but I don’t think it would be fair to him if I’m not 100% over my ex. About a week ago, I talked to one of my friends, and they told me that if I wanted anything serious with N, I needed to block A so I could actually move on. I ended up doing that.

I’m not 100% sure N likes me, but there are a lot of signs. He starts conversations with me and sends me things all the time, and he compliments my hair pretty often. He also went to our school’s winter carnival activity day specifically because of me, and he stayed around me basically the entire day. He seemed disappointed that I wasn’t going to the school dance and even said he would’ve gone if I went.

There was also a moment during the winter carnival where he tried to trip one of my friends, and her boyfriend told him to stop because “N wouldn’t like it if I did that to her,” and instead of saying my name, he looked directly at me when he said it.

I’ve asked two of my guy friends what they think, and both of them said N definitely likes me. I like him too, but I keep wondering—would I be a bad person if I tried to start something with him even though I’m not fully over my ex yet?"

1qs0g1u,Coach taking it too far?,Advice,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I’m 17 and I got a tongue piercing earlier this month my coach finally had something to say..

my main coach tells me to go say hello to the girls coach so she sees my piercing because she apparently didn’t see it before. She says why would you do that to yourself doesn’t it hurt?

She says that’s why you have a lisp and spit everywhere now.

I say I got it for me, it was a Christmas present.

She says you know people are you going to perceive you in a way that’s not true but we know your not like that since we’ve know you for yada  long and I said something and she said so you want to be perceived as that? I said no?

I walk away and roll out my leg

He comes over, standing while Im sitting on the table and starts to mention my tongue piercing. he says that I’ve been hiding it and he’s notice, which I haven’t? He says it’s unprofessional if I want to get a professional job

I should dress a certain way if I don’t want people to think something’s of me ( I think someone might of sent a post from my instagram idk) later mentioning  that this piercing is something I would have done in my freshmen year that this is experimental

Before hand he asked what did your mom say about this I said my sister got it for me and I got the piercing later I showed my mom she said alright

He started to tell me how to behave with my mom saying I should start asking her permission for things and before I go out and do stuff with certain people just to try and better out relationship comparing mine to his moms

after he says you don’t have to answer but “ is your dad in your life? “

My heart drops and I say no with tears in my eye because it’s a sensitive subject obviously indicating that everything I do is because of my lack of father figure.

He says imagine what your dad would say about your tongue piercing and how I dress adding he’s only says this because he cares and he’s watching all of us

he was talking as if he were my” parental figure” saying in that point he cares

I say my mom cares too

He uses the stick and says if I were your mom I would have been hit with this hangs it on the table

I get up because I’m already on the verge of crying hugs me

And he says don’t forget to smile

Idk how I should deal with this, I’ve been thinking about it all day and it’s rubbing me the wrong way.

plus I don’t get why every grown man that shows up in my life wants to play “daddy” in my life because of my lack of father figure??"
1qs0cqv,am i an asshole,School,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Context im nearly 18y M technically in high school (here it is a bit more complex but it doesn't matter) 4th grade. I have some colleagues and Im quite neutral for everyone.

So... there is this guy lets call him Carl. Carl is autistic u can see it by the very first look at his actions plus I heard some teachers say it. I knew he didn't have friends so I talked with him few times in the spam of 2nd and 3rd grade. And this was a mistake. He is rather pushed out of the class for being annoying but he has some friends outside.

To the point, I switched friend groups cause (a long story) and he sometimes talked with my new friends but when he saw me talk to them he started to push himself into our group. We are all nearly 18y we sometimes talk about more serious things like relationships and in the middle of a conversation while I was talking about a breakup with a friend, this Tony Montana guy walks in and interrupts my talk and starts to talk about Clash Royal. U get the point? Sometimes u are talking and than he stops u in the middle and he says exactly what u said but with different words just to let u know that he wants to say something for attention. And its not subtle its every 15s he does something so u remember that he stands there. Carl doesn't shut up. Other example in the hallway we stand in circles idk why maybe because the hallways are narrow and its quite comfortable, but we stand  shoulder to shoulder quite close together AND CARL just tries to squeez himself inside by grabing u by the shoulder and trying to make a gap. This started to piss me off since the start of last year and its been worse than that. I had the luck to date 2 girls in the spam of 4 years so he asked me what should he improve in himself to make girls like him and i was suprised so i told him directly to talk less about random shit and try to listen more. He ignored it the next day because he explained basic minecraft to me for the 178278123567123567132 time and most of the things that he says are irelevant next day. Like those ai characters on the internet that after every conversation reset. Also its not that easy to just let him speak and dont give a shit because he does something like this: he speaks and than ""do u know?"" and he waits for your reply. Also he is everywhere. I had screamed at him few times for just making me mad like this when i was really mad but in span of 2years it happened like 3 times so not bad. Worth mentioning is that Im a bit introverted so i like to have 20mins of peace walknig to my sisters school with nothing but music on my headphones. Ofc as u can imagine he pops up from nowhere and starts to go in the direction that im going and the talk beings ahhhhh....

Okay enough, so u might see me as a mean motherfucker but look at this he isnt doing this shit for a month ITS BEEN 2YEARS of talking to him nearly everyday. I undestand that he is autistic and i shouldnt be mean to him, i tried to help him but he is clueless and also Im not his nany. I have been more mean to him, but not like ""go fuck yourself"" type shit but more like ""can u please be quiet for a minute"" when im doing something or i want to continue a topic we talk about. He sees me as a friend and i dont want him to do so so i subly try to leave me alone and he doesnt undestand it like a little child.

So. am i an asshole?"

I’m Jay, a 17M in high school, and I am shit at relationships. That being said, I’ve never been in one because I always find some way to blow a crush. I’ve only ever had one girl like me, and I didn’t like her the same way, since she’s been through a lot of Trauma with other guys and I don’t wanna add to that melting pot.

Anyways, I just watched some cartoons and one of them was that Bobs Burgers Limo Contest episode where Tina has a bunch of worries about prom, and then that got my brain all worked up and now I’m sitting in my room hyperventilating cuz at this rate I’m gonna die alone. I’ve never been on a date, and I’ve unfortunately grown distasteful to the premise of romance due to so many fucked up experiences with girls. And yet I’m so nervous about prom because you know, it’s prom. I gotta go if I wanna have any chance at proving I’m not a fucking loser, which I’m not but I kinda am? I don’t party or anything but I’m a theatre kid and there’s just so much I don’t have time to explain.

Point is, I don’t know what to do about prom. I’ve considered trying to get one of my friends to hook me up cuz he’s got a girlfriend who has a lot of friends but that seems kinda weird and desperate, and I’ve thought about just going with friends but I don’t wanna get into Prom without a date cuz that’s pathetic, and I can’t stay home cuz I’d Christmas tree ornament myself, and as you can see I LOVE TO RAMBLE AND IMAGINE DOOMSDAY COMPLEXES AHHHHHHHH.

This dude, J, is in my math and science classes. Every other day, we have double periods where math and science are two classes long instead of one, and these are both on the same day. I have made it relatively obvious that I like him. I look at him a lot in class, and during midterm week in the cafeteria, he caught me looking at him multiple times, but I immediately looked away. We talk on occasion during class. During midterm week, my friends and I were in the auditorium waiting for our next test, which was for math. My friends didn't have calculators, so they went to get them, and I stayed back. While I was sitting alone, I saw J walk up towards my row, and before this math test, we had both taken our science midterms in the same classroom, but he finished the test before me. When he was walking up to the auditorium, I called his name out, and he came to the row behind me (which was empty), and I asked him a few questions about the midterm and what he got for them. He said he was also confused about some of them, and we talked about it for a little bit. Then, my friends got back, and the one who sat next to me (second closest to the end of the row) looked at me with this Cheshire cat ass grin, and I wasn't sure if he noticed or not. But a few days ago, he came up to me in science and asked what my friend's name was. I told him her name, and he didn't say anything else, just went back to his friends. A day or two after that, he mentioned how he fell outside and asked the teacher for a bandage, I went back to talking to my friend after hearing it though, and I didn't notice if he got one or not, I also had a cut on my finger, and I had just washed my hands a little bit before class, so the bandaid I had on the cut needed to be replaced, so I took out my mini first aid kit, and grabbed two bandaids and offered him one from across the room, but I guess he already got one because he said no thanks. He apparently looks in my direction during class when I am not looking, but I heard that from my friends, who have science with me, which can be pretty unreliable most of the time. I asked my math teacher for advice on the situation, and he told me that unless I drop the literal most obvious hints, he probably won't even know I like him unless I talk to him directly. So, I decided I need to take his advice, and I am planning to talk to him on Monday morning and ask for his Instagram. Any advice on how I should go about this?"
1qrns2j,What advice can i give here?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"i’m unsure about what flare to use so i just picked this.

anyway, my boyfriend has this friend “Karl” (19m). Karl is in a relationship with another dude “Pete”(19m) Karl and Pete are doing long distance, Karl is in basic training for military and Pete lives further south. they have been together for around 2-ish(?) years now, and they often travel to each other. 

recently there has been a lot of drama between them. karl has been ranting to my bf (who has taken it to me for advice) that he thinks pete is cheating and is being childish. karl has noticed pete posting a lot of explicit content on instagram recently, even one in just underwear and a furry mask, one of those robotic ones, which karl isn’t ok with and has brought up. pete responds to this by ignoring karl, leaving him on read and even when karl is there, just pretend like he isn’t.

yesterday, karl told my bf (who again told me) that pete wanted an open relationship, and gave an ultimatum, it’s open or break up. me and bf told him to just end it cause it’s getting to a point where he is open about the fact he wants other people, but he decided to sleep on it.

today, karl came and said they compromised. that comprise being involving a 3rd person into their bedroom life. to me, this doesn’t seem like a compromise, this seems like karl is going against what he wants because.. i actually have no clue.

now to add to this, karl also isn’t perfect. he talks behind pete’s back to bf all the time, calling pete a “wanna be hoe”. he also has an onlyfans so it’s not like he is much different than pete on this, difference being accepting money for the same.

what do i even say here to actually get him to understand what he has agreed to do? karl says he wants to marry this guy, but is it really gonna last when he is actively doing something with someone he clearly doesn’t love, while gaining nothing but more hatred?"
1qrmn3e,My friend got Broken up with and I think he’s a loser for it,Rant,Emotional Pressure,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"A close friend of mine recently got broken up with, and at first I felt genuinely bad for him. From the outside, he seemed like a kind and thoughtful boyfriend, so I assumed he’d been treated unfairly.

About a week later, he told me the ***full story***. I was disgusted 🤢 

He said the first year of the relationship was great but the sex was “lacking.” So after they had s\*\*, he asked his girlfriend if they could open the relationship and be polyamorous so they could sleep with other people but still stay together.

Like are you stupid?? It would obviously make someone feel insecure? ESPECIALLY right after s\*\*. Basically just saying she wasn’t enough. He later admitted that after that conversation, the relationship was never the same ( it was good after but never GREAT)

What made it worse was hearing his mindset. He said he was upset by the idea that other men might not find his girlfriend attractive. He also compared his relationship to his best friend, who constantly talks about hookups n stuff, which made him feel like he was “missing out.”

At one point, that friend even said he wasn’t attracted to my friend’s girlfriend, and instead of brushing it off, my friend took it personally and felt insecure.

By the end of the conversation, my sympathy faded. It became clear the breakup wasn’t about his girlfriend doing something wrong, it was about his own insecurity, comparison, and need for validation.

He told me that on Omegle he ended up meeting a girl who exposed herself to him. They exchanged Telegram details and shared explicit stuff. The girl later found his Instagram ( telegram was the same name as his insta) dude is flipping stupid. threatened to leak everything if he couldn’t send 500£. He was only able to send 150£ and got his yk leaked. To hide it, he logged into his girlfriend’s Instagram to block the account and delete anything before she could see it. He eventually confessed (2 months later). At first she was okay with it but slowly she became colder and more standoffish. It was basically GG’s from there. 

I think he’s pathetic and I couldn’t hide my disgust for his behaviour. He’s recently become 20. 20 years old and doing that?! Ewww"
1qq7k6h,My friend is distant from me because her new bf used to like me,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Shes currently dating a guy I used to be friends with that had a crush on me and she's mad at me because I let him have a crush on me. But like why wouldn't I he was bringing me free snacks at my work and like i wasn't flirting back or nothing I was just allowing it but i was trying not to lead him on by just acting the same with him as everyone else.

But when I met a guy I liked i then started trying to set up my friend with him cause he is a nice guy. So I was bringing her to hangouts and basically bringing up convos they both had interests in so they would talk to eachother. 

So eventually they did start dating and I was so happy for them so I was asking if I could hang with them and stuff and he said yes but she didn't really want to but I was literally the one who got them together. But she told another friend about it who came back to me saying that she didn't want me around him because he used to like me basically.

But she knows im not a threat and I'd never do anything to ruin that relationship, and she knows im taken too so idk what the issue is

1qq6lq6,Help!!! How do you guys date. I have no idea how to.,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I am a 16 year old female turning 17 this Friday on the 30th. I went to a girls school from early childhood years to elementary school. During middle school, I went to a mixed religious school. Over there, I developed my first crush at 11-12. When I first saw him, my heart started beating and I had butterflies. I had never had a crush before that, but I had then knew that, that is the “crush” feeling that people had. Me telling you my middle school was religious is crucial for what I’m about to say. I couldn’t do anything at all because they were so strict about males and females touching and chatting with each other. They were so extreme. We had to playgrounds. They would literally, lock the girls in the other playground during our free time. So we wouldn’t interact with each other. We would alternate playgrounds every week. I had very little chances to talk to this guy especially since he was in a higher grade than me. I knew he was interested in me back because he would just stare at me and say nothing. Also, when he would catch me alone, he would ask me how am I doing and if I am okay and would baby me. But when he was around his friends, he would say mean things about me. At this point I was already losing feelings and my feelings were completely gone by the end of the year. Was going to a new school. This left me confused, I thought to myself, how am I ever supposed to get a boyfriend if I am always being policed on talking to boys and the first person I ever liked was mean to me. So I leave, to my new school and by the time you know it, a year goes by and I am in another grade, this is 13-14. Boom I develop another crush. I didn’t even know his name. He was also in another grade than me. Which doesn’t help because I never got to interact with him. I don’t want to get too deep but I was also battling depression that year because of what had happened to me in that school. I was also all of a sudden insecure with my looks (due to social media). Would always wear a hoodie and a face mask. When I got the chance to, I wanted to be around him, but at the same time I didn’t. Anytime he would come around, I would always speed walk away because I was so nervous.

Fast forward, I left that school due to what I was going through and started doing much better at another school. After that crush up till now, I still have not developed a crush on anyone and this is getting scary. I say this because I will see someone who I KNOW is physically my type and has an amazing personality. But I just don’t feel the butterflies. I feel like I am supposed to, but I just can’t; my body just won’t allow it. There was this boy in the elevator, who just turned and we smiled at each other at the same time. Then he just sighed and told me that he liked my earrings. I wasn’t thinking and I started looking at him from top to bottom. When we exited, i told him thank you and that i got it from my mothers glove box and that i wanted it match my gold rings (probably shouldn’t have said all of that). I just started blushing super hard when I had gotten upstairs, even blushing till I fell asleep. Even blushing the next day.

I had then realized that the reason why I looked him up and down was to give him a compliment in return because he looked so cute. He has had brown wavy hair with beautiful blue eyes and a black trench coat, with black pants and black dress shoes. He was so cute and had this interesting aura to him. Though I didn’t get the butterflies as I did when I was 13, he had like this interesting aura to him that I didn’t know what is was. I really want to run into this guy again because I am so interested. I wonder how people go about dating people they initially didn’t have butterflies for but were interested in and how that turned out for them. I don’t know if this is supposed to be platonic or romantic. But all I know is that I’m interested.

NOTE: I should probably have mentioned that I have very tiny gold hoop earrings and have very curly hair. I was like at a 90 degree angle towards this guy. When I looked in the mirror I could barely see them 😭😭, so I was a bit confused as to what he was talking about."
1qq5cfw,What are your niche hobbies? (Mine seriously affected me deeply),Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"&amp;#x200B;

Mine is reading fictional works with super intelligent characters, and by intelligent characters I don't just mean any smart character but there are actually fictional characters with 50+ layers of thinking processes that are all explained, logical and connected.

Honestly there are characters so intelligent that it's unimaginable how people can write them.

\[Only read below if you want context since it will be long\]

Some context: Examples of such characters are Chen Ran from \[Eighteen Levels Of Hell:Lying Is Forbidden Here\] and Ang Xiao from \[Being A Talent In Chusheng Demon Sect\]

Chen Ran is in Hell where verbally lying is forbidden, but everyone here deceives each other in countless other ways. Chen Ran usually deals with concepts such as Time Paradoxes, Parallel Universes, Causality Manipulation Problems, Infinities, Logical paradoxes, Semantics and countless complex concepts, many many characters in here are super smart that it's unimaginable. People here casually make plans over 40 steps, each step being super complicated and they all take part in complex dozens of layers of schemes.

Ang Xiao is an antagonist of a Xianxia fantasy novel, he is so intelligent that every of his actions has 10+ layers on it which are all explained within the story. Basically the protagonist has the ability to return in time if he dies. In the protagonist's first lives Ang Xiao completely manipulated him and everything around him, in later lives the protagonist starts countering Ang Xiao but couldn't escape Ang Xiao's plan.. More lives later Protagonist starts countering just for Ang Xiao to reveal that he had planned everything from the start, Protagonist keeps on countering and countering but Ang Xiao's planning is simply too monstrous that he had already made countless contingency plans for every possible scenario he coul think of. This continued for a while until Ang Xiao was seemingly defeated just for him to reveal that everything so far was just one of the branch of his countless contingency plans and so the loop goes on again, eventually Ang Xiao was outwitted but his adaptability is too insane that he adapted in such a short time and completely outplayed the protagonist.. Basically Ang Xiao and the protagonist keeps exchanging schemes for 1000 chapters straight, with the Protagonist always countering Ang Xiao just for Ang Xiao to reveal that he had planned it all from the start over and over again... Ang Xiao basically had thousands of contingency plans and narratively he probably had some unimaginable number of contingencies that he had formulated from the start.

Both works aren't famous outside China and Vietnam, so only few people like me reads them.

Seriously I love intelligent characters so much, they taught me a lot of things, I was also already consuming fiction with many intelligent characters at 11 years old but I kept diving deeper and deeper until I arrived this deep, I'm currently 16 right now and it's insane how much such characters taught me.

I said all this because I wanted to share my niche hobby(although it's not truly uncommon getting this deep is)"
1qpz8uo,my dad has no shame,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"i'm 18m. not that it matters that i'm an adult cause that didn't change my dad's behavior one bit. so i obviously like most high schoolers have had times where i had to go into the office with my one of my parents (they always call my dad in because they think he gets more mad than my mom since he shouts at me in front of them. that's what they may think but my dad usually just yells at me then drops it while my mom goes on and on and on even weeks after it happened) my dad has bipolar disorder so he usually goes from the most calm person to the most aggressive in the matter of seconds. the second he finds about something through the staff at the school or anytime he finds something out that i did he will literally scream at me and repeat the same shit over and over no matter who's in the room. after that he either drops it entirely or he brings it up again in the most chill way possible. for this reason after my dad comes into the school for whatever reason i never walk with him knowing he's not going to care whoever is around he will just say what he wants to say then and there. one time i took my one of my dogs collar off and there was huge screaming brawl that ended with the police coming to our house. there were several police and one of them talked to each one of us in the house individually and as the police were leaving he had no problem continuing it. the police told him to stop escalating the situation and he literally yelled ""bullshit"" right at the cop. you know what's funny? he said after that ""we are never going to have another dog"" and a couple weeks later guess what? we got yet another dog. another time at my wrestling meet which my dad attended i hadn't been able to talk to my friend who attended the entire time and i was able to catch him before we were about to leave and i literally said like one thing and he said something back and suddenly my dad started yelling at me in front of him and everyone else to get to the car. another time i had left my binder in the car before school (on purpose because i knew i didn't need it that day) and because he was already mad at me for something else he literally threw the binder right outside the window and screamed ""you left your fucking binder"" and my papers went all over the place and there were people outside. these were just a few of many things that happened and just shows how my dad has zero shame in embarrassing not just me but also himself in front of other people."

And it’s so draining to have him constantly “you never hang out with me anymore” because I’m busy with school and work, and he does that every week, it’s exhausting constantly having to deal with him, and now he’s so dependent on me to hang out with him and he brings it up constantly that I’ve “been ignoring him” even though I’ve told him I’m busy he even said this the day after Christmas and when he said “I don’t think you’re cheating on me and I’m not jealous of your hb” out of no where it’s crazy like why would he bring that up.

1qpsu5z,Wazefuk's Stupid Storytime - The F#ck You Tyson Scandal,Other,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"It was a couple days before the start of 6th grade, around August 2024. I had just gotten back into music producing and was on an absolute roll. Fantasizing about making my next mediocre track was all that I could think about. While riding this high, I had made a satire song poking fun at the idea of diss tracks and needless drama in-between friends, *Fuck You Tyson*. Unfortunately, this song had a fatal flaw in it that I had completely overlooked: I had never asked Tyson, the person this song was insulting, for any consent to use his likeness in the song! This initially didn't phase me all to much.

&gt;*Fuck you Tyson,*  
*You ruined my favorite thing*,  
*You stole my favorite quarter!*  
*Oh, o-o-oh oh\~*  
*I hate you Tyson.*  
*Fuck you Tyson!*

The school year came around, the album was out, and, in a twisted turn of luck, I had accidentally left the song out of the initial release. Instead of using this to maybe second guess if I should even release this song, I was keen on re-releasing the album with the song (and a couple other unreleased tracks). After a few months, I had finally gotten around to making a companion EP to the album, which included this song.

A while later, I had told Tyson about my new album. I showed him a couple songs, he said they were mid, and I had assumed that was the end of it. Tyson at home later that day had poked around a little bit and stumbled across Fuck You Tyson. After listening to the song with what I could only imagine being a jaw that hit the floor, he was *furious*.

At first, I didn't even recognize his resentment towards the song. He'd occasionally bring it up out of nowhere in otherwise unrelated interaction, usually in a rather vague or confusing manner, as if he had randomly snapped. When this happened, I'd have no idea what the hell he was talking about and one of us would usually change the subject too quickly for much to happen.

Instead of actually coming to his senses and formally confronting me about it, he let this *fester*. He just let it boil inside of him, with the fire only fueled by my unresponsiveness to those random bursts, and everything was *flaming*. One day, he had finally had enough and needed to take this loathing out one way or another.

My friend circle is built around collaborative and creative games, like creative writing or glorified shitposting together on Google Slides or something of the like, usually on our school iPads while slacking off at school. Tyson decided that he should administer justice for my wrongdoings by turning these projects in to the school administrators. Before we knew it, me and all of my friends, including Tyson, had their iPads confiscated and inspected.

I tried to plead my case to the principal, claiming that the time we used to make those projects were all fair game, that we hadn't made anything that clearly violated any rules, that these were in no way related to any other thing going on at the time, how the creative aspect might even make them beneficial to our learning. But no, principal wasn't having *any* of it; according to them, if something isn't strictly related to our work, it was garbage.

A few days later, I was called into the office. The principal had a talk with me about the power of art and how it can affect others' feelings, and how things like Fuck You Tyson can seriously hurt someone. To me, this wasn't about slandering anyone, playing with feelings, or anything of the sort—this was merely a work of satire, a statement about the futility of childish and immature drama, rumor spreading, and creating trouble just for the hell of it. This whole thing is exactly what the song was portraying. I tried explaining that, but the principal refused to even listen.

Next thing, I was being lectured by the counselor next. Out of nowhere, the counselor popped the question: ""*Do you want to kill Tyson?*""... *Excuse me...?* Somehow, Tyson managed to gaslight the school to such an extent that he managed to convince them I was a threat to his *life*. Remember, this was over a what was clearly a *joke*; if not a bit insensitive of a joke.

Around this time, I had suddenly gotten an unbearable fear of loss, though it was probably coincidental that it happened in the middle of this, and I had gotten a pretty bad digital hoarding problem. I suddenly couldn't go an inch without making sure my archives of basically everything I've ever done was safe. Files weren't just fragments of fading memories, they were extensions of my very *being*, and losing them means losing *myself*. For my school stuff, including stuff that goes back to when I was a 9-year-old and the stuff I've made with my friends, I had a huge 12gb+ archive of all of it backed up on Google Drive, which I also had a second backup of stored on an old hard drive at home. This archive was by far the most precious to me.

Whilst our iPads were all in the office, they had the IT guy going through my archive. There were hundreds of files of ""nothing but foolishness"". This did not please them to see. Next up was by far the most traumatic and lasting part of this whole ordeal:

I was cleaning up my aforementioned old hard drive. At the same time, the school decided it was a good idea to go ahead and, without as much as a heads up on my end, *delete the archive*. I had accidentally deleted my home backup of the archive. *No worries, I'll just get another copy from Google Drive—*

**It's gone. It's fucking gone. They fucking deleted it. Hundreds of precious memories are gone.**

I cannot put into words just how furious I was. *What the fuck? How could they do this to me? What were they thinking?* After an emergency unexcused mental health break from school, I marched to the principal and *demanded* an explanation for why they did this, why they didn't give me as much as a ""oh hey we're gonna delete this 12gb folder, make sure to save it somewhere if it matters to you"", and gave them a hefty lecture on how much was in there and what it meant to me. The most they could've given me was: (paraphrasing here)

&gt;Oh, it was nothing but games and foolishness. All we want on our devices is work, essays, and assignments. We looked through your Drive and there was not a speck of anything work related, so it's worthless to us. All it's doing is hogging our bandwidth and so we decided to delete it. As for your heads up, we aren't really obligated to give you one, and who the hell cares about any of that, so we didn't bother.

What. Why. What are you thinking. No. That's not how any of this works.

\--------------

Despite all of this, me and Tyson are still friends, somehow. Tyson got over it, though is too prideful to apologize and admit that he was overreacting, and I still have a bit of a hoarding issue as a result of this. All-in-all, the aftermath of this incident includes:

* Me no longer being able to name-drop any of my friends in songs I make if my parents have anything to say about it
* 99% of all projects, pictures, and memories I've ever made from late-2021 to mid-2024 being wiped from the face of this planet
* Me gaining attachment issues
* Everyone's first impression of my music being Fuck You Tyson, making everyone think I make shit music despite me having gained so much talent since then
* Somehow, word of this incident spread to most surrounding schools, forever making me the ""F You Tyson Guy"""

Side note: shes also said that if she was born in 2000’s she would be lesbian (jokingly) even when i said you cant hust choose to be lesbain?? This is literally the most strange thing that has ever happened to me. 

Tbh the jokes make me uncomfortable, like i would ofc be okay with my mom being gay but i am so confused, is she cheating on my dad??? Also just saying explicit things about lesbains around me (15) that are just like “UH WHAT??” "

1qplihd,What's the craziest way you've been asked out/found out someone liked you,Social,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"hi guys I'm bored and I want to know if anyone else has been asked out or discovered you're someones crush in really insane ways??? I'm not very attractive and I'm annoying in school so I appeal to a specific demographic of people that. Are certainly interesting. But I mean this in a fun way.

one guy who liked me since we were 6 would chase boys who spoke to me around and he bit the crotch of one of my bestfriends and its genuinely the funniest thing that's ever happened to me. My friends always bring up something he did that I don't fully remember where he basically brought flowers, cards, a huge teddy and a greggs cake to school to give me but the thing about greggs cakes is that they used to have little plastic rings in them and he basically ate the cake and just gave me the ring with all the crumbs on it. I specifically remember everything being binned except the teddy because it was huge and I loved it. FYI he was genuinely terrible he'd throw things around the class and hit teachers and I was terrified of him. He tried to ask me out again when we were 13 and my cousin had to scare him off. 

The funny thing is this same exact thing happened in highschool with another guy who I'm still friends with. He was telling everyone he had a crush on me and I think he thought he hid it well when he didn't because none of my friends know how to act. Anyway a whole rumor went around that he'd ask his super secret crush out on the last day of the week and on the day I told my friend I was gonna go home at Break (I didn't want to see him I was so embarassed) and she was like ""No No just stay until Lunch atleast!"" and I told her I knew what was happening and when I saw the guy he had a bouquet and a bag of chocolates and a card to give me. I felt so bad people kept coming up to him while I was there and saying ""have you asked her out yet"" and I had to act like I couldn't hear anything. It got to a point we both knew I knew and just weren't bringing it up. I'm such a bad person for this but my cousin came in clutch again and scared everyone off and she had to tell him I didn't feel the same way because I think he felt too shy to ask after the humiliation of the entire day before. But yeah we're still friends so it isn't that bad but omg...

the only other time I'm aware someone has liked me was when I was 15. I was walking down stairs and he caught up to me and as he passed he was like ""Oh hey syre, btw did you know I used to have a crush on you?"" and then he just walked away before i could speak. I was so sure I was being pranked because hes like leagues above me but 2 weeks later my brother told me ""I'm not supposed to say but did you know this guy from your class liked you when you first met"". I brought it up to him again and he said he didn't know why exactly but when we first met (at 13, he joined our highschool late) he just fell for me, but it faded after a few months. I don't remember every actually speaking to him so I'm guessing he just thought I was pretty which is crazy?? However my running theory Is that he was into quiet girls and I fit the bill really well, but after a few months he realised I was actually really fucking loud and annoying outside of class and he was icked. Honestly thank god because my cousin (yes the same one as before) had a crush on him and he was flirting with her when he had a GIRLFRIEND. NASTY

so yeah these are the weirdest and also the only times anyone has ever asked me out in person. These are definetly super tame so like I wanna ask you guys. Also yes I know asking a bunch of teens on reddit if they've been asked out is like asking a middle aged woman not to scream at little kids during her child's football game (it wont happen) but... I'm bored

Also IS THIS THE RIGHT FLAIR IDK IF ITS THIS OR DISCUSSION BUT YEAH"

He's everything i ever wanted in a guy's personality  omg he just matches my energy like hess so so so so so good I've never felt this way for any crush before cuz he's not a friend and we're not flirting He just GETS MY WIT. like goddamn he gets it  SAME POLITICAL BELIEFS- GOD. SO HOT. (and no hes not faking it ik cuz i approached him cuz he said smthng that made me approach him- as friends)  
but a day before yesterday since i was moving on i was gonna confess and stuff or maybe drop a hint- i just got to know he's not from my religion we dont follow the same beliefs and im religious and i want my significant other to be religious we still talk we still match our humour but now i dont see him as a pottential romantic partner which is ok   
nothing has changed between us  
and i think thats for the later good.

1qpa8xk,my boyfriend just broke up with me,Rant,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"English is not my first language l'm sorry in advance

We had a fight two days ago where I told him he wasn't stable enough mentally and physically to do certain things yet. He took it very, very badly. We both broke down and I apologized profusely. I know I can be very mean sometimes ane it's something l'm willing to work out. I have mood swings linked to a mental disorder. He has multiple disorders too, and I've always helped him and worked with him. When it happens to me, he leaves me. I just feel like it's unfair I put up with his troubles and he does reciprocate
He went home in the morning. 

I texted him in the evening asking if he could come with me somewhere but he wouldn't answer so I called him. He asked if we were still a couple. I said yes, obviously. I'm sorry if my post is confused and weira I'm writing through tears ane my mind is a mess.
He said he needed space, that what I've said reallv hurt him. I said I was sorry and that I want to change for him, because I love him more than mvself and I want him to be happy. He said we were on a break. I of course begged him to work things out because l'm stupid. 

I can't remember what he said but we hung up and I cried a lot. I self harmed again after 4 years sober. I'm an horrible person and always mess thingS up, I self sabotage my relationships. But I do sincerely want to change.
I called him again about an hour ago. He told me I'm horrible and don't see it. I do see it. I told him manv times that I am progressing and doing things to change. I keep saving that I love him. He hasn't said it back. He told me he wants some space because what I said traumatized him. All I said was that he wasn't stable enough right now. I didn't think it'd impact him that much, but it did. I know it sounds weird and that l'm not telling the full story, I don't know why he took that so badly.

He didn't specifv how long he wanted to break to be or if he would take me back. Or if I was allowed to see other people. I have my finals soon, if I can't attend mv classes I won't be able to go to college. I haven't felt like this in so long. I can't get up of bed, it's only been 2 days, barely. I was supposed to go somewhere important for college today and I didn't go. I'm not sure if I'll go tomorrow either.

I can't move on he's my first love, I've given him so much of myself, of my time and monev and body and stuff and feelings and everything I gave him everything. I still have his stuff in my room. His guitar, his clothes, his amplifier, his glasses.

I'm thinking of killing myself. I have nothing else but him. I don't have anything worth living for. It sounds super cringe when I sav that but that's how I'm feeling. He hasn't blocked me yet and told me (idk if he said that out of pity) that I could call him later. I told him I had no one else and that I'm alone. I don't know what to do, I know it'll fuck up my studies so l'd rather kill mvself now. I just want to give up everything already. I know I'll never find love again, I look terrible, I'm fat. I just want all of this to end.

I'm thinking of doing it this weekend. I don't want to tell him because imo it'd be manipulative. I can't tell anyone else. I'm all alone and I hate it so much. I deserve to be hurt for the horrible person that I am. I know it does sounds very cringe but I deserve to die, I'm awful.

She sent me a message yesterday saying she wanted to stay friends but she thinks we should be on a break. She expressed that for her sake we needed to separate for a bit and that she felt more like my therapist than my significant other. 

I feel horrible, I wish it was brought up sooner and I wish I could've changed how the dynamic was. She still wants to be friends but idk if I want to be just her friend. I want to respect her boundaries, I haven't been talking to her much since and I don't want to loose her all together, but this broke me a bit and idk if I want to be in this grey area. She said there's a chance we could get back together, but she won't date anyone for a while. I know I fucked this up, I know I'm not exactly amazing in a relationship cause I can be too clingy and I struggle picking up on things. I don't blame her, but idk what to do from here.

Idk if our dynamic will every really change, I want to be romantic again and I hope it can become that, but this grey area will hurt me. Do I stay her friend? Do I abandon ship? "

1r1e9zh,Is this r*pe?,Advice,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"So errrm i don’t even know how to start this but I’ll try my best:

Almost a year ago I was with my girlfreind and we got a bottle of vodka (500ml), she had about 2 shots and then I decided to try and chug the bottle (not my best idea) I finished the entire thing and was very drunk.

I always have problems remembering things when I’m drunk even if I don’t drink much, so this time I had 0 recollection on the night as I hadn’t drunk much before this point so my tolerance was low. The next memory I had after finishing the bottle was cycling home (also not the best idea). I told her the next day I had no memory of the night before and she said neither did she so I left it at that beliving nothing had happened.

About 3-4 months later I was curious and asked if I was a virgin as there were one or two nights where I didn’t rember what happened, she laughed and said “Noooooo defiantly not” finding it funny and telling me I was certainly not a virgin.

I’m not sure where I was going with this it just kinnda feels wrong that she would lie about not remembering anything and would not tell me I had lost my v card which I think is quite a big thing.

We are still together but one or two of my freinds who I’ve told are not very anti her and think I shouldn’t still be with her.

Any advice is appreciated, I’m just not sure how to feel about it. I’ve only recently really thought about it as I would just push it aside whenever it crossed my mind in the past."
1r194cp,She was my Snapchat add… now she feels like my future wife,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I will share my whole journey with her😭😭

So it all started like the most random modern-day thing ever… a Snapchat add. No expectations, no plans, bas ek normal conversation. But somehow, within days, it didn’t feel “random” anymore. The more we talked, the more it felt like we had known each other for years. Slowly, the texts turned into long calls, the calls turned into hours, and suddenly she became the one person I couldn’t go a day without.

At first, we were just “best friends.” At least that’s what we told ourselves. But the truth was, it never felt like normal friendship. The way she cared, the way she checked up on me, the way she got possessive sometimes… it was different. She’d get annoyed if I disappeared for a few hours. She would ask where I was, what I was doing, and somehow that felt comforting rather than controlling. It felt like someone actually cared.

Over time, we became each other’s safe space. She shared things with me that she didn’t even share with others. She’d vent, cry, laugh, and I’d just stay there, listening. I wasn’t just a friend— I was her person. And she was mine. We had our own world: inside jokes, late night talks, random romantic moments, fights that lasted 5 minutes, and then suddenly “love you” again.

I had proposed once before, months back. But she always had fear. Not because she didn’t feel anything, but because for her “relationship” meant something huge— like soulmate, husband, life partner. She wasn’t the type to date casually. She genuinely believed if she says yes, she’s committing fully. That scared her, because she overthinks a lot and she’s terrified of the future going wrong.

Still, even when she said “no,” she never left. She would still say “love you,” still act jealous sometimes, still talk about us living together, still imagine a future. It was confusing, but also clear in a way— she was emotionally already mine, she just wasn’t ready to label it.

Then came the biggest moment. She came to my home on 30th January. That day changed everything. Seeing her in real life wasn’t just a meeting, it felt like reality finally caught up with what we already were. Suddenly, everything became more intense. It wasn’t just texts and calls anymore. It was presence. It was real.

After that, things kept getting deeper. I even sent her handmade cards and love letters, the kind of effort people only do when they genuinely love someone. And she noticed it. She felt it. The way she reacted made it obvious she cared a lot more than she admitted.

Eventually, after so many months of slow love, after so much waiting, she finally said yes. Not in a dramatic “movie” way, but in her own chaotic style— teasing me, asking questions, then finally accepting it and admitting she felt the same. And honestly… I have never felt happier in my life.

Even after saying yes, she still had her overthinking moments. She’d suddenly panic and say she needs time, because she’s scared of boundaries and scared of being trapped. But the thing is… she never said she doesn’t want me. She just said she wants to be sure. She always repeats the same thing: she wants to see us in every phase of life and then decide fully. Because if she commits, she wants it forever.

And that’s what makes it special. It wasn’t a fast relationship. It wasn’t “we met and started dating.” It was slow, emotional, deep, and built on trust. We had other options, but still chose each other. And now we’re at the stage where we’re not just emotionally attached… we’re craving physical presence too, because the bond has grown beyond friendship long ago.

So yeah… from one Snapchat add to being the most important person in each other’s lives— it’s crazy. But it’s real. And I genuinely believe some people aren’t meant to be “just friends.” They’re meant to become home."

Like one time I requested the wizard of oz and said that it might scare the kids because of the monkeys, by the way one of my siblings loves monkeys. I also requested Labyrinth, multiple times, it's like one of my favorite children's movie. But she says it's not appropriate even though she never seen the movie. One time she was looking at screenshots of the movie and said ""looks old"". WE'VE SEEN OLDER MOVIES TOGETHER AND SHE'S COMPLAINING ABOUT AN 80's MOVIE! She also saw pictures of the goblins and thought it would scare the little ones. They may be young but they've seen worse stuff, my mom let's them all watch Stranger Things. Also I've let them watch some movies in my room, examples: my sister saw Army of Darkness (theatrical version obviously), my brother whose almost 13 has seen First Blood/Children of the corn/Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.

The past 3 years has been really tough on me. I'm trans and I came out to my mom like two years ago with she accepted me but then got all mad at me until I said I wasn't and then a year later I re came out and then I got the silent treatment and then said I wasn't again which was a lie. 

Every day my body dismorphia just gets worse and worse and worse and I just feel more shittier and shittier each day goes by. I'm at a weird spot rn. Like I wanna just do it and transition but ik I can't because all my family will just turn on me and I'd be fucked.

Ever since 2024 my dad has been going on transphobic rants making me feel worse and worse each day and a few weeks ago came up to me and asked me if I'm a tr\*\*\*y which made me feel even worse.

If I come out to my dad, my whole relationship with him would be gone, destroyed. But with my mom we'd probably go sour for about a year until she accepts me.

And also to make the body dysmorphia worse I cant grow out my hair so im stuck with a shirty haircut I hate which makes me feel ugly so idk. Times are tough and I need advice on this, it's getting so bad I even asked chatgpt lol😭😭😭

But anyways if you read, ty &lt;3

so i just reconnected with my old best friend. i always used to be in love with her. our friendship kinda fell apart just becuase we graduated middle school (8th grade in my country, at 14yrs old), and went to different high schools. we havent talked in around 1 to 1 and a half years. Weve been talking for around 11 days now. all my pld feelings have came back, and became stronger. she is must amazing. i literally cant think of anything else, but her. i know im crazy lol. weve always been just friends. altho im more than a beet friend to her (even at the moment), its more like family rather than romantic interest. i told her yesterday that i have a crush on her, and that i owe it to her that she knows abt my feelings. she said thanks for telling her and that she wont let this get between the two of us. noe, the mext day, im in school. under 3 hours ive written 4 poems. 6 in total counting the 2 i wrote last week. we talked abt me going down to her place (to walk around outside, just the two of us) on her birthday, two days from now. she hasnt canceled it, even tho i 'confessed' after making the plans. shes sending mixed signals. i trust her completely, and she trusts me competely, but i honestly doubt shes open to more than a friendship. especially with me. i now feel like a creep, becuase of the poems, i just have no other ways to process my feelings. i know they dont make me creepy, but i feel like it. i just love her more than she can ever imagine. if anyone wants more context (believe me, theres a lot more), just ask for it. im happy to share.

tldr: title

ps.: i cant show the poems, because theyre in hungarian, and unless some of yall are hungarian, you wont understand them. i can translate them tho, just without the rhymes."

1qzfx36,I fucked up,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So everything was fine with me and my girlfriend and we were planning a valentines day date but today i messed up big. 

I was out with a few friends celebrating my birthday at a restaurant and when we were done i noticed from a snap that my girlfriend was out with friends at a place thats kinda public but only they have access to. (Its complicated so im not gonna explain it). Well, i asked her if my friends could come over and quickly say hi. She replied no. My friend asked my gfs friend and she said no. We called them to make sure they were serious. They were. 

Like the dumbass that i am, we started walking there and showed up behind the window and glass door. They ran to somewhere where we couldn't see them from the outside and texted us that we are not welcome. 

We left and i realised i had fucked up badly. My gf started texting me how i made her and her friends nervous and scared, and how i had broken her trust. 

I bought her favorite drink from a nearby store and wrote a sorry note on it and left it behind the door. 

I realise now how big of a piece of shit i am for doing this and i've sent her a few sorry texts that say more than just sorry. 

Im not sure if our relationship is gonna work out now and i really hope it does but i also understand if she wants to end things with me.

1qzdb9n,My friend lies to my face all the time. What do I do?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Okay, so I have this friend, we’ll call her A. So A lies to me like all the time. All the time. 

We’re supposed to move in together when we graduate so we can both get out of our households. We bonded (not trauma bonded, just relating) over the summer maybe 4 years ago because we both had JROTC tg 2 years in a row and we had each other to talk to when shit got rough at home. 

She lies about literally anything. ANYTHING. Some guy she saw walking down the street had a knife, somebody wants her so bad and then another person wants her too, her fathers like super rich but lives in Japan, tried to show me a picture of her father but it was literally a Pinterest image w no face, everybody’s always looking at her or checking her out, somebody said smth racist to her then Evb started hating on her, some dude was following her and she hit him, etc etc. —literally anything to make her seem like a victim or superior in some way.

it’s just stupid white lies but a few weeks ago I found a few lash clusters in my room. I do not wear lashes as a masc, my sister is 13 and doesn’t use them, and we live with our dad. I was on ft when I found them and so I showed her and I literally watched the gears in her head turn to come up w something. 

She waited like 3 minutes then gasped and told me she knew who it was. We’d moved about 6mo ago and none of my friends had been over so it wasn’t them and this girl is gonna tell me her father sent someone into my home to check on me? I was so frustrated bc ik it’s just a load of bullshit but this is such a close friend I’m not sure what to say about it. Its snowing. There’s no tracks up to my door nor my windows and it just irks my nerve whenever she does ts. 

I don’t ever tell her when I catch her in a lie, but it’s literally daily and every time she has the same hesitation, the same tone, the same mannerisms and I’m getting tired of it. "
1qzd049,Concerns about friend,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So I am a junior (17f) and am friends with another girl in my class. We've been school friends since early ​of my sophomore year, and we don't hang out outside of school but that's not what bothers me. I thought that we were friends, as we would confide in each other and stuff, always choose each other for projects, etc. However, recently she had made some comments suggesting otherwise. Every day after class she runs to see her best friend and gives her a big hug (she's only hugged me about 3 times, but they've known each other for years) and one time she made a comment about how she ""always loves to hug the people she cares about"" while I was standing right there. Another time she said ""love you"" to this girl and I made a joke about how no one loves me after she said she tells all her friends she loves them l (she's never said it to me) and she just got sort of quiet and was like ""don't say that."" And she's made comments about how she was playing a game and used the names of all of her friends and I wasn't one of them. Ik I'm probably stupid for being upset at this but I just legitimately thought we were friends during these past 12+ months and I don't know what to do now. I feel like I'm her filler friend but maybe I shouldn't be upset about it.​"
1qzauxz,I need an relationship advice,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"i was in relationship with a girl for about 7 months then it was caught by her parents. she got many warnings and it caused many problems to her with her parents and when i asked her what was her plan she said she is not going to break the relation. i asked her one more time after being in no contact for months she said we can continue it when she gets a new phone which she will get in this school vacation, her phone was damaged and her parents wouldn't give her their phone because of this relationship issue. this was happened before 2 months she is ignoring me very highly, i can only see her when she comes to church and she isn't talking to me in the church now"

1qz8drj,Idk anymore,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"My family scolded me for forcing myself to eat while because they angry if there food waste and also angry when I’m forcing myself so then I couldn’t say anything when they talking to me and they find it disrespectful so after dinner my mom go ask me that if I didn’t like talking to them I mean yeah you scold me for doing something I didn’t like but force me to do it yeah I don’t like talking then my mom got even mad and said that next time I don’t need to show up for dinner and I can be by myself and she won’t talk to me now 

so what do I do?"
1qz4t0p,I don't know who I like,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"So as the title suggests I don't know who I like but I am making this post BC I want to know if I like two people and what I should do about it. 
So there is a girl in the year below me and she likes me heaps and I think I like her but she said she is probably going to date in year 9. She is 2 years younger than me which got me called a p*do a lot but I think everyone'soved on a bit now. She is going through some hard shit and I probably wouldn't date her right now anyway bc I don't think that is what's best for her(or me tbh). But there is another girl in the year above who I don't know if I like and I feel like likes me but then I think I only want that to be true. We are really good friends(we text every day, we can tell each other stuff((or that's what I thought)) etc.). The other day we called on the bus on the way home from school(we catch different buses) and we somehow got onto the topic of who we like. I asked her and she had massive hesitation. She eventually asked who I liked and and I said girl A because that is what most people think. She again hesitated for 15ish minutes and eventually said a guy from another school but everything in her language said in my brain that she liked me BC otherwise why would she insist I tell her who I like first. 

So that's all I can remember/ feel comfortable saying. I left some personal details out but they are unimportant to this post. I don't expect much to come off this post but right now I will try anything. "
1qz1jc9,Should/how should I ask her out?,Relationship,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"We’ve been close for a while now. like talking almost every day, laughing a lot, walking together sometimes, calling after school, all that. Nothing officially romantic, but also not distant. It’s one of those situations where you’re clearly more than random friends, but nothing has ever been said out loud.

At one point, she straight-up told me she liked another guy (someone from her past). That messed with my head a lot because I didn’t hear it through rumors. it came directly from her. Later on, she said she doesn’t like him anymore and that she’s not looking for anyone at all right now. I don’t think she was trying to lie, but I also don’t know if she was simplifying things or just saying how she feels in the moment.

Even after all that, she still chooses to spend time with me. She’ll ask to call, stay on the phone for a while, talk about drama, ask my opinion on things, want me to walk with her, all of it. It’s easy, not forced, and it doesn’t feel awkward. At the same time, it’s not clearly romantic either. (Yes I used ai to write this I don’t want to write all this shi)"

1qyu97l,"Color, Again (fading light)",Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"When I was small,
the world was reckless with color.
Skies too blue to be practical,
sidewalk chalk that never washed away,
days that felt endless
because no one had taught me
what endings were for yet.
I loved without fear then.
Wanted things out loud.
Assumed time would wait for me
the way grown-ups said it would.
Then, before I could name it,
the colors thinned.
A shadow crept into the corners of home,
a locked room where the air felt too heavy,
and a hushed voice whispered
“tell nobody.”
Somebody I was meant to trust 
Made trust feel impossible.
Suddenly laughter felt sharp.
Sunlight cut.
Even the smallest joys
carried a weight I didn’t know how to name.
Elementary years passed
like muted sketches.
Middle school gray settled deep,
each day a careful step
through walls I built to survive.
Trust became a currency I had none of.
Dreams folded small enough to hide
so no one could take them from me.
High school came,
stretching long and narrow,
still dull, still cautious.
But near the end,
something shifted.
She appeared.
She first in many years
I would let touch me at all,
someone who earned the trust
I never thought I would give again.
Suddenly warmth was possible,
a fragile proof
that safety could exist
outside the shadows.
And now,
the world is creeping back into color.
Slowly.
Carefully.
Like it’s afraid I’ll look away.
Her smile is brighter than I remember.
Sunlight lingers longer on my hands.
The air hums with things I almost forgot
to notice.
That’s when the wanting comes back.
I start imagining the life
I trained myself not to.
A ring, simple and honest.
Her name next to mine
on envelopes and inside jokes.
A small place that’s always a little messy
because life is happening inside it.
I see mornings;
coffee going cold,
arguments that end in laughter,
the kind of love
that doesn’t need to be poetic
to be real.
I see children.
Little ones with her eyes
or my bad habits.
Running down hallways,
leaving fingerprints on everything,
calling me something that feels
too big for my chest.
I want the ordinary years.
The boring ones.
The ones no one writes about
because nothing dramatic happens
except staying.
And that’s the cruel part,
because now that I can finally see it,
now that the world has color again,
time feels fragile.
Like it’s clearing its throat.
I don’t want an ending.
I want more.
More days.
More chances to grow into the life
I can finally picture clearly.
So the world turns bright again;
not to mock me,
but to remind me
what mattered enough
to imagine.
If this is what seeing feels like,
then let me see fully.
Let me love loudly.
Let the color stay,
not as a goodbye,
but as proof
that I was never wrong
for wanting to live this deeply.
Yet..
My body tells the truth
before my mouth can.
Blood blooms when I cough.
My hands shake more than they should.
Walking feels like wading
through something thicker than air.
Every breath costs more.
Every day leaves less behind.
The future I imagined
doesn’t disappear,
it hovers, unreachable,
like color behind glass.
I can see it clearly now.
Marriage.
Children.
Ordinary years
that will never learn my name.
Hope feels like a language
I learned too late.
Something beautiful,
but no longer meant for me.
My time is close;
I feel it in the weakness,
in the way my body
is already practicing how to let go.
So if the world is bright again,
it isn’t a promise.
It’s a mercy.
A final kindness 
to let me see everything I wanted,
in full color,
before the light slips out of reach."

Which i understand, she has been working so hard to get where she is after their divorce, but i am TIRED of hearing about how much she doesnt like paying it.

1qy7224,My friend denied inviting our white friend to the sleepover because she gives off a vibe she doesn’t want at the sleepover. Is she wrong for that?,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"(F16) and black. Three of my friends are black as well, been friends since middle school. “A.” Is white. She was a pretty nice friend to be around with. however, we never had nothing in common which was okay. she didn’t have many friends beside us because a lot of people weren’t fond of her because she can be mean without realizing it. Like, passive aggressive. Saying rude insults as jokes, thinking she was friends with the people to make jokes like that. The four of us were close-knit together as friends, that didn’t mean we never added “A.” Into the group. However, even then, you never had a friend that you just couldn’t hang out with individually? Like, you had be with the whole group to with her or it would be very awkward. 

That’s what it felt like. Despite us being friends, I couldn’t imagine having a sleepover with her but I wouldn’t mind going out to eat with her. but, the four of us wouldn’t mind having a sleepover together. My friend “j.” Planned sleepovers to her house constantly, I asked if “A.” Was coming. She shook her head, saying that she didn’t want that vibe coming into the sleepover. “A.” Had an history of being extreme weird and randomly rude without realizing it. As well with having no relations or anything in common. It would be awkward. 

I never did realized why nobody likes her until we decided to hang out after school. All five us this time. We walked to chipotle which was a fourteen minute walk. “A.” Was walking with a friend behind us, walking really slow. we decided to turn around a few times, making sure she was behind us. Eventually, we arrived to chipotle waiting twenty minutes to discover she still wasn’t here. We got worried, calling her multiple times and no answer.

We began packing up to walk around the streets to look for her, thinking she got capture or something. We walked over to an Starbucks that’s next to chipotle, realizing she was in there with a friend, talking. Her phone next to her. We asked her why she didn’t answer her phone, she said, “I assume you guys wouldn’t care.” In a snarky tone. Today, we walked to chipotle and she decided to make a joke out of it, saying, “the last time we came, you guys left me.” 

We immediately got on her ass. Cause we didn’t leave you. We constantly check behind us, making sure you were there and yet, you were walking slowly talking with your friends. 

When I make a slip-up, saying that me and the girls were having a sleepover, she was like, “I wonder why I wasn’t invited.” She said, in a tone I can’t explain. But it was like, snakiness. She was overly emotional, crying over anything. We have to be careful of any words we say to her unless we’ll offend her. 

Ask any questions."

NOPE. Knowing my sister, she one hundred percent would not pass up the opportunity to check my phone and the worst thing is, I DON’T KNOW WHAT WAS ON IT! My tabs could have either been:

We walk to and from different places a lot and she asked to hang out at one point which we did and it was very fun.

I feel suffocated so genuinely, yet every time I bring up how even if it’s just something else I want to do instead of talking on call or having multiple hour text conversations. I immediately get told that I’m just trying to avoid talking and must “hate her” I’ve never tried to purposely Avoid talking to her unless I for some reason had to. It’s like I need an excuse just to get some time to myself, and I never make her talk to me. If she wants space I’ll happily give it to her. How can I reason with her to stop this?

1qx9elk,So there was this girl...,Relationship,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Back in 8th standard, there was this girl I really liked. Mujhe uspe crush tha, nothing dramatic, just that quiet kind of liking that sits in the back of your mind. Beech beech mein I liked other girls too, normal school stuff, but somehow I always ended up coming back to her. She was my friend, and that made things even more confusing because I never really knew if she had feelings for me or not.

Then COVID happened. Lockdown, schools closed, everything went online. It was 9th standard, and during that time we started playing Among Us together. It made us closer, at least that’s what it felt like to me. My feelings just grew stronger, but I still didn’t say anything.

By the time 10th standard came, I was still stuck in the same place, liking her, overthinking everything, and not having the courage to confess. Boards ended, school ended, and time just kept moving.

After some time, I finally gathered enough courage and told her how I felt. 

Her response wasn’t a straight rejection. She said she felt attracted to me too and had a crush on me in 9th. That one sentence gave me a lot of hope. But then she added that she didn’t want to date anyone. Her parents had found out about her previous relationship, and she had promised them that she wouldn’t be in one again, at least not until graduation. Usko kaafi dino tak manaya, not aggressively, just trying to understand if there was any chance. She was clear,no relationship till graduation.

I decided to wait. Literally told myself I could wait till graduation if that’s what it takes. But slowly, our conversations started becoming less frequent. Replies came late, talks became dry, and that closeness we once had just started fading. 

A couple of months later, she posted an Instagram story, a guy’s hand resting on her lap. My heart sank. I didn’t confront her directly at first. I asked a friend of mine to casually ask her about it. She told my friend it was her father’s hand. I didn’t fucking believe that for a second.
So I asked her myself. What she told me broke something inside me. She said she had been seeing a friend of her brother for a while. I didn’t react much in that moment. I acted calm, like it didn’t matter, but it stayed in my head. 

Later on, I found out the truth. The story she told me and my friend was false. It wasn’t her father’s hand, and it wasn’t her brother’s friend either. It was actually a guy she met at her coaching. She started going to that coaching after I confessed to her. And while I was waiting, believing her words about not dating till graduation, she was making out with this guy every other day in their friend’s apartment.
I don’t know what hurt more, the fact that she moved on so easily, or that she lied so effortlessly. I didn’t get angry, I didn’t fight, I just felt stupid for waiting, for believing, and for thinking honesty would be returned with honesty. "

There were complications which didn't allow me to try to get with her.

I feel like its mostly due to my Ex talking to her and probably ruining my image, since we all are in the same college.

now, with my next problem. I am a good student, or at least I was. I was not one of the best in my class but i was up there. we had our final competitive exam around a week back. I for some stupid reason lazed out in the last month when everyone else worked hard. in the end i scored very average and not that great for what i could have. So far i didn't have to work really hard to be better, but i couldnt in the end. I lost, i have a second attempt in april so i really want to do better there. So many people who were worse than me did so much better. I am still unable to study due to these issues.

1qwxjrl,I genuinely fucking hate this (suicide TW),Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I made a dumb joke to my classmate after our school counselor guilt tripped me into joining a club I didn't want to (irrelevant) about how I probably wasn't going to live long enough for said club to benefit me at all. And now my mom knows about it and I'm meeting with the same school counselor about it. This happens every time I so much as mention the fact that I don't want to live anymore. I don't actively have a plan to end my life. I don't have the balls to pick up the knife and do it. I have no real safe space at school or at home because nothing ever stays private at school and part of the problem is at home. I get pulled out of class and waste the valuable time I have to learn and have to sit down with this wrinkly old bat who tells me she wants me to be happy when she's actively making everything worse. I can't win. If I don't talk about not wanting to live, I bottle it up and it gets worse. If I do talk about it, everyone and their mother finds out and it gets worse. No one except my therapist has ever sat down and asked me WHY I don't want to live. Because violating my privacy and trust over and over again is not helping. My parents learning how to open their fucking eyes and be actual parents would help. My family not making fun of me for loving Michael Jackson would help. My school letting my words stay private would help. But no one ever sits down to ask me that or takes MY advice on how to make ME feel better. They think they know what's best when all they're doing is MAKING EVERYTHING WORSE."
1qwcob7,I don’t like myself,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),A few hours ago my mom got a letter saying that I was eligible to do AP courses for my PSAT scores. I didn’t think I had did well but I thought maybe I was wrong I tell a few friends and they tell me that they give those to anyone. But for the first time since I was in fourth grade my mom said she was proud of me and she sounded really happy and sincere she told most of her side of the family. When I looked at my score it was only a 960 all of my friends had 1200-1300 all I can think now is why couldn’t I be like that why can’t I be better I’m supposed to be smart but this is all I could do. I’m falling apart right now I got in the shower and just started crying. I just feel like I can’t do the one thing I’m supposed to. I feel like a disappointment

1qw3ty2,"Messy breakup, I'm disgusted with myself.",Social,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"I dont know how to start this so ill get right into it. I'm a 19 year old guy and a freshman college student. My girlfriend and I just broke up (lets call her Tina). We first started talking a few months ago when we hooked up after a frat party, and kept things going from there. At some point before we became official we had a brief rough patch where we didn't talk for about a week, in that time i hooked up with one of my friends but after we decided to not do that again and stay as just friends. Tina at this point knew that me and my friend had kissed but didn't know that me and my friend had slept together, she made out with someone at a bar, we fought but forgave each other and started talking again. She specifically asked me if I slept with my friend and I lied and said no. I planned on telling her eventually but the timing didn't seem to be right. After this we became an official couple and things went great for a few months until a couple weeks ago. I was at the bar one night when she wasn't, and I tried to get a random girl there to buy me a drink just to see if I could do it. I had no intention of doing anything with this girl and didn't. The next day one of her friends told her about it and we broke up. I ended up cutting myself pretty badly to the point I needed to get stitches, and I was in the hospital just for a night. When I got back from the hospital, Tina and I talked for a few days and decided to stay together. The same day just a few hours later one of her friends heard that I had slept with my friend and told Tina. She came into my room, yelled at me, and then went back to her dorm. A few minutes later she texted me saying that she had cut herself, I then asked if she was safe to no response. (she is safe, the text was a lie and her roommate made sure she was ok)

	Here's the really awkward part, we're both in a pretty niche major and there are only about 12-15 people in our class that are taking this major. We have all our major related classes together and there's no way to really avoid her. It's also a really small school so we run into each other in the dining hall, gym etc. 

I feel like I ruined a perfect relationship for nothing and have a horrible self image of myself now. I hate the person that I've become and just wish I could take it all back. Im not trying to play the victim, i know im an asshole and i know i fucked up and have to live with it. I'm so disgusted with myself and it's all starting to hit how much the lying and leaving out information has affected her. I've accepted that the relationship is over and there's nothing I can do.

Like 2 months ago she said and I was like “girl what are you talking abt?” And she INSISTED that it was potato tomato, when I asked how on earth she got that she said it was from her grandma. No shade to her grandma but not only I she not the best at English, she also has been saying the Spanish word día (day) as dio (god) so I don’t really trust her with language.

When I told her that that version of the phrase doesn’t work because it’s supposed to mean “same difference” and potatoes and tomatoes are entirely different things she STILL argued with me? She over here talking abt “well no like their pronounced similarly” girl that’s not the point of the saying 😭"

So im kinda taken as a joke by my classmates that arent my friends. My friends actually respect me and i dont care about those classmates but its still annoying. Like in the morning im very easily annoyed and my desk was moved. I didnt care so i took a random classmates desk (before yall blame me nobody really cares about their desks only 3-4 kids) and then i saw my og desk and asked the kid standing at it for it. Then this girl lets call her Hannah started laughing. I got mad and kept call and just took the random desk. Then she told me to get my og desk and told her like 4 times that i dont give a fuck. Then she mocked me. I wasnt really in the mood too argue so i went to the hallways and chilled with some kids 1 grade lower. Said hi to some twins i knew when i was like 6 and then went outside. 
Another repeating instance is them throwing my pencil case. Like not to like make me jump to grab it they fight with eachoder and they always throw it. But they for some reason always fight in the front of the class and i sit in the first lane and thats the thing they see first.
I tend to be very chill about this stuff since i dont really care what they think or do. They kinda stopped when they realised i dont really care and i just wanna chill with my friends
Another reason why they maybe stopped is because i let anyone copy off me and i tell them the answers during tests"

But the main issue is that my mom says that she has to sleep on my bed because like Spanish culture respect your elders etc etc. Reading this back I’m pretty sure it is me just being a spoiled brat or whatever. My mom asked my opinion on it and I said “you wouldn’t like what I have to say” she said “fine do whatever you want blah blah” she was pissed off at me, which I’m pretty sure is valid. But like 30 mins later I accepted it and I told her “I’m okay with it but I don’t want to sleep on an air mattress i want to sleep on the couch” the couch is just more comfy imo but she seemed more mad at that for some reason. But another issue is that my great grandmother is an old immigrant from Colombia who only speaks Spanish, again I am trans so she doesn’t respect my pronouns/name whatever. It’s not that big of deal cuz she only speaks Spanish and I can’t at all I mean I can understand some but like barley. So that doesn’t really matter all that much. Another issue tho is that I do online school and my whole workspace is in my room and if my gg stays in my room idk what time she wakes up but I have to be in class by 8 so like I’m not sure where else I can do all my work or whatever and I talked to my mom about it and she said she didn’t know so like idk.

1quncj8,How to get over an unhealthy obsession,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"For context, I (16F) was friends with a girl (16F) who was in my class, and she was probably my closest friend back in that school. Now we no longer study in the same school, and I haven't seen her for 5 months already. I've always known that she's aromantic. I realised I like her around a year ago, but I kept it to myself while we're still in the same school because I don't want to make things awkward, and don't want to distract the both of us from our exams.

At the end of last year I decided to confess over text, she rejected me politely and said she's not interested in relationships. It really wasn't much of a surprise but I was, inevitably, a little sad. I thought I can move on from then, but I can't. 

Then I realised I don't love her because I want to be in a relationship with her, or to get anything in return. I just do, because she deserves love.

Y'all know Valentine's Day is right around the corner, and every time I see cute valentine's plushies I thought about gifting her one, or if I go to cool places I thought about going with her, the list goes on. 

I woke up this morning realising I need to stop, because ultimately I'm the one who will suffer the consequences of this obsession. So I've came to this sub in search of advices. 

TLDR: Confessed to a friend 2 months ago, got rejected but still not over her, what do I do?"

We talk all day because neither of us have a lot of friends that we can vent to. She likes to vent to me and I offer advice. It's very platonic and nice because I recently got out of a short relationship so having someone new to talk to is helping me get over that. I was hoping to go to the gym with her sometime this week since she said she didn't know how, so I offered. Except I brought it up to my parents on going with her and they said a hard no. They then proceeded to say they don't want me even texting her because it is inappropriate. They said they don't want me talking to her at all and any of the texts/messages I send her can be taken a different way and if she wants to I could get in legal trouble. I understand how it can be considered inappropriate due to the age gap and yes, we do make dirty jokes but have a very good understanding on they are JOKES. My parents said that I already consider it a relationship because I said we have a lot of common interests and talk day and night. I don't think I'm that blind to all of the bad things that could happen, but I also don't want to lose this new person that I just started talking to.

And recently we been playing chess tg too (we both suck). But like i always catch her looking at me and she always wants to talk to me in skl, one day she was like oh where were u i was looking for u lets play chess. And when she has a lesson and im free she tells me to come to her class and tells me to sit next to her. And like im not that funny but she says im pretty funny. And she was playing kill,kiss,marry with her friends and said she would marry me bc im a great person.

And she like always makes these jokes, like once she asked wanna paly chess i was like yh, where, she was like in private and like bit her nail in a jokingly manner and was joking basically. Her and my other girl best friend make these jokes quite often with me, my girl best friend and i do it jokingly but she joined in recently too and does that quite often with me now too.

But idk man do u guys think shes just like a friendly person or smt?. And like in class whenever i look at her i get butterflies in my stomach and whenever i think about her i get butterflies as well, SO IDK NOW. Please help me out.

1qtwrop,Anyone else’s parents always overreact?,Serious,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I have been feeling down lately and I was just chatting with my mom about how she always tells me to do things I don’t want in order to get over it. the context was that I’m going to my dads house tomorrow but she thinks it’s a bad idea for me to go. I then respond with the whole “do stuff you don’t want” thing. she got upset and started saying how I'm always talking like she’s horrible and never remember anything good she does for me. I’m confused? Because I never said anything like that. Idk maybe it’s cus I’m autistic and I may be missing a social thing, but it seemed weird to react like that."

1qtgio3,My friends all want me to go to prom with them but I can’t go without her,Other,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"My friends, (15/16), and I, (15), have our prom this year. We had a deal at the start of the school year  when we were dumb 14 year olds that if we wanted to go to prom, we had 2 rules. 1) we ALL had to go. If anyone was going to miss it, we’re ill, or had plans, none of us would go. 2) We each had to take our girlfriend with us. (The single people had to find someone before the end of the year). We came up with this because we were told that prom was the “best night of your life” and we thought we would regret it if we didn’t spend it with who we wanted, and the first rule was so that nobody missed out on said “best night ever”. The other 5 in the group have someone. I don’t. They aren’t budging. They think i’ll be able to find someone before the end of the year. I told them that can’t happen, but they don’t understand. 

When I was 13, the worst part of my life happened. Not get into details, but it made me despise the idea of having a girlfriend. 

A year later, putting me at about 14, I met who I thought was the best person ever. *She* was 15, but we were still within the same school year, so it wasn’t an issue. -We’ll call her R because GOD forbid someone I know finds this-. R went to the same theatre class as I did, and on my first day I was just trying to make friends with people I didn’t know. She was the first person I talked to. She wasn’t just talking to me, she was *talking* to me. The most genuine I think anyone’s ever been to me. We loved the same movies and whatnot, talked about how much school sucks and how much homework we had to do etc. She was just being friendly, telling me people’s names, where things were, whatever. I couldn’t even think. I felt like I was underwater or something. I’d never felt like that before, when someone just connects to you so deeply. She was so sweet to everyone she knew. I got added to the group on snap and got hers personally. 

A couple months pass. It’s after my media studies class that I get a text from her. She said she “really likes me”? Nearly dropped my phone from the top floor of the building down the stairs. We’d talked a little, so this was seemingly out of nowhere. We started seeing each other outside of theatre, maybe twice a week at most. Still a lot, considering we went to schools an hour apart. 

I learned all about her family, her firefighter dad, her sister, and younger brother. I wanted to meet them all, but I never got to.  

one night she didn’t snap me back. Which isn’t weird at all, I wasn’t expecting an immediate response or anything- i’m not the crazy obsessive weirdo type, so I think nothing of it. But she didn’t respond for a while when I texted her about something else unimportant the next day. And she stopped showing up for theatre. No R anywhere. Her friends were really vague about where she was, or if they’d spoken at all. Now I was  a little concerned. A week without any communication? She usually texted me every other day or so, going from that to no nothing was real weird. We never officially broke up. I took her out loads, i’d always pay for everything, I tried to be nice whenever I could, so I really had no idea what I did wrong. 

I feel like if I took someone to prom that’d be wrong. If i’m going with someone, it has to be her, right? and I can’t *not* go, then my friends won’t. And I don’t wanna do that to them.

but the break up text she sent was full of love, a big paragraph telling me she knows what she's been doing is hurting me, and that this break up is merely space for her to fix herself to come back to me all polished. she reassured me that i would always be her person and that she loves me very much still.
despite that, weve still been in contact and talking as usual, minus the pet names. the conversations got worse each day, she got more evil and colder and heartless.
i dont know what built up inside me but i had a gut feeling that a firned of hers wasnt rlly just friends with her, so i dmed and asked
turns out shes her gf, and they confessed to each other a few weeks before my ex broke up with me, and got tgt a week after she broke up with me.and how could this happen when one of the breakuo reasons included religious guilt?
her new gf swears that she didnt know of my existence, that my ex swore that she was single at the time.
my ex was pleading and begging me to not text her gf and that she would do anything for me to stay silent
but yk after all that drama, her new gf still decided to stay with my ex, which wasnt the satisfaction i was looking for.
my ex told me that she had lost feelings in september, and everything after that, all the loving sweeet stuff she told me were lies because she was scared that i would genuine end my shit if she broke up with me
but yesterday she told me that she doesn't care if i live or die anymore, and today she blocked me off all her socials.
get this, she was saying that she poured her whole heart into me like no other person, all those effort and shit and NOW, she has no more capacity to give the same type of love to her new gf and shes blaming me for it
she said she wishes we never met so i wouldnt be hurt like this by her

i just dont understand avoidants man why cant you just act right

idk how to deal with this, my heart has been so heavy, my health is declining and i have mo motivation to do anything. somehow i hate her new gf for replacing me but i still love my cheating manipulator ex. must be the power dynamics. she took away my golden teenage years, 16 and 17"

1qs6zo9,The Story of Deception and Letting Go,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I was 28, working a private job, and under pressure from my family to get married. Since I didn’t have a girlfriend and wasn’t planning to go abroad, I agreed to an arranged match. Through relatives, I was introduced to a 22-year-old law student. We connected on Facebook, chatted for days, and eventually met in person at a restaurant. 

Though her appearance—darker complexion, use of filters—was different from her online profile, I accepted her as she was and emotionally invested in the possibility of marriage. We talked for hours daily, and I saw her as my future wife. But shortly after our meeting, she stopped responding. When I finally reached her from another number, she said she no longer wanted to continue and ended things without explanation.

Months later, I discovered she was already in a serious relationship with a man in Japan—posting about him as her ""budo"" on Facebook—while talking to me about marriage. I felt betrayed, but instead of confronting her or exposing her to her boyfriend, I chose not to act. I believed it would be wrong to ruin someone’s life, even if she had misled me.

I realized I was lucky—she only wasted a month of my time, and I avoided deeper emotional and financial investment. I still struggle with why someone in a relationship would give false hope to another person, but I’m at peace knowing I handled it with integrity. This incident taught me two valuable lessons: not to be easily deceived by whatever the people post on social media and never trust anyone easily."

1qrezvo,Failed my math test (but more embarrassing),Rant,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Just came out of a precalc 12 test today and wasn't able to finish it. The test is worth my full math grade and I'm worried because if my average (or grade in required courses) drops too much, the university I'm accepted to could take away my offer.

I went straight to the bathroom and as I was walking out my teacher saw me as she was walking down the hall. She asked if I was ok because I had just had a good cry in the bathroom and she had seen me tearing up when she collected my exam. My face and eyes were all red and puffy and it was obvious. But when she asked me that it was like all the work I put in to stop crying was useless and I just started like sobbing and crying it was pretty embarrassing. So she said ""did you write something on the last few questions"" and I didn't and so she went to get the test and just like looked through it and told me that I had filled out the important stuff anyways or something and I just nodded and left.

I'm a bit of a teacher's pet in math because I don't really have good friends in that class so I hope she really thinks about it before giving me a bad mark. I see a tutor twice a week but when I have to solve stuff by myself I just can't idk. I hate math"

1qr61uv,i think my friend is a pervert,Advice,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I've been incredibly uncomfortable and angry at my friend ever since she's started being like this, but I need to know if what she's doing can be classified as anything law breaking or generally just being a pervert. for convenience, I'm going to call her D, and i'm going list actions she's done and things she's said and give me/people's reactions to it.

1. when my korean friend (korean is important here) announce she was leaving our school, D started being incredibly clingy and hugging and not leaving her side (she's never even sat with us prior to knowing our friend was leaving) she would also get all in her face which made my korean friend/everyone around them really uncomfortabe. it got so bad then my korean friend politely told her to tone it down and D cried to me during class because of it.
2. We have 3 korean friends, and when they were all still there, D would lable them as ""baby 1"", ""baby 2"" and ""baby 3"", she would often call them ""babyyyyy"" or ""you're/she's my babyyyyy"" in a whiny, moan-ish tone, making me and everyone else uncomfortable. And she'd do ths randomly to, not with the intent to call any of them over, but just to say it. At one point when she started to do it, I left the lunch table to talk to some other people who usually sat somewhere else.
3. Frequently entrapping others: When my korean friend eventually left the school, D started cornering my 2 other korean friends and touching/stroking them (eg. arms, back, head, shoulder's). At one point, I had to physically separate them because I could see how uncomfortable my korean friends were, not to mention that my othe friends were incredibly disgusted too.
4. When my korean friends nap at the lunch table, she said ""oh my god sleeping koreans are so cute!"" in that whiny, moany tone. i dont think i want to comment on this.
5. when i suggested/asked her if she was bisexual (because she was being so affectionate to (korean) females, she very seriously denied it. but the next day, she pulled me aside and told me she was bisexual. i was initially supportive (im bisexual myself), but when i asked her what was her gay awakening she said ""I saw a lady in public and I started getting sexual fantasies about her"" Again I won't comment on this because i cant string the wrods to express how revolted and angry at her for this. but what i will say is that no matter if you like boys, girls, aliens, chairs, nothing, it has nothing to do with harrassment.
6. My non-korean friend and D were arm wrestling for fun. when the match ended, my friend tried to pull her hand away, but D would not let go. My friend felt very uncomfortable during that moment.
7. non-korean friend was naping in class, and D said ""wouldnt it be nice if i patted you to sleep?"" i wont comment on this.
8. another day, she was sat in between 2 of my korean friends who were once again, napping, at the lunch table, and she said, again in the whiny, moaning tone ""guys look i'm sat between 2 cute sleeping koreans!"" I really wanted to punch some sense into her, but that wouldnt lead to anything.

Some things she also did that I wont classify as pervert-behaviour but still really bothered me and a few other people:

1. when one of my friend's were talking about how its hard to find clothes that she likes/fit her well because she was so flat, and suddenly D jumped in saying ""yeah i get that i'm pretty flat too."" D, compared to that friend, or in general, is not flat, she's a C cup in my opinion, maybe even D. And she jumped in while someone was talking about an insecurity and trying to make it about herself. Inconsiderate and rude in general. I've noticed her do this a lot: someone mentions something bad that happened to them/about them, she jumps in with a similair experience.
2. random self-deprecating comments about herself. Won't name any, but its typically about her weight and general appearance. She's not a bad looking girl, she's pretty average, she is fat, but fat doesnt mean ugly, and she works out and is wayyy healthier than me (i dont exercise at all and i often dont eat a lot of nutrients). I understand have low-self esteem, but i dont condone making it other people's responsbility to maintain it.

Because lets say, she says ""I'm really fat"", and we disagree, we're enabling her to rely on us for reassurance and implicitly giving her the green flag to dump things on us without consent. if we agree, we'd look like jerks.

I'm contemplating on telling an adult, but im also a senior and about to graduate in less than 6 months, it's not worth it, but if it worsens/gets increasingly physical, i seriously might get people involved.

**UPDATE:**

All my friends agreed that we didn't want her sitting with us and we all wanted distance. We talked to her during our break, she cried, said that we wrongfully accused her and that she ""knows she's innocent"" over text despite explicit evidence being stated. then, she went to her old friends and cried to them while changing the story to make it seem like she was the victim (according to a witness). They ended up distancing themselves from her because they didn't feel comfortable getting involved with someone else's drama and also because they've witnessed her behaviour before. So now she's essentially alone, because she secretly hates her only friend, and that very same friend is also closer to our friend group. "
1qqwrdu,I think my last relationship was karma coming full circle and for the first time I feel at peace with it,Social,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I don’t usually write long posts but I feel like I need to put this somewhere. Maybe for closure. Maybe for myself. Maybe for someone else who’s stuck in the same loop.

I recently came out of a breakup that completely shattered me. At first, I thought I was the victim. I was angry, confused, couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat properly. I kept replaying everything in my head and asking why this happened to me when my intentions were genuinely pure.

But after sitting with it for weeks, writing things down, being alone, something clicked.

I realized this relationship wasn’t random. It felt like karma.

Years ago, my first girlfriend genuinely loved me. She gave me time, attention, effort. Back then I was in college, busy, distracted, addicted to games, focused on myself. Even when I had time, I’d say I was busy. Slowly I emotionally checked out. I wasn’t evil. I wasn’t cheating. I just stopped being present. She became insecure, then toxic, then everything fell apart. At that time, I didn’t fully understand what I did to her. I moved on thinking it just “didn’t work.”

Fast forward to my recent relationship.

This time, I was on the other side.

I was the one asking for time. Not control. Not obsession. Just 30 minutes or an hour a day to talk. When she gave it, everything felt stable. No insecurity. No fights. When she withdrew, my mind filled the gaps. Trust issues started. Anxiety started.

I tried to fix it. I compromised. I traveled long distances for her. I adjusted my routine. I woke up early just to talk to her. Even after the breakup, when she was rude, I was still gentle. I still cared. I still wished her well.

And then one day she said something that broke me completely. She told me I was a burden.

That sentence destroyed me. Not because I’m weak, but because I knew how much I had given. I wasn’t asking for too much. I was asking for the bare minimum. And still I was made to feel like a problem.

That’s when everything collapsed inside me.

But after the pain settled, after journaling everything honestly, I saw the pattern. The exact same thing I once did to someone came back to me through someone else. Emotional unavailability. Distance. Choosing distractions over connection. Saying “I’m busy” when I wasn’t. The roles were reversed.

And suddenly, I didn’t feel angry anymore.

I felt grateful.

Not in a fake spiritual way. In a very grounded way.

I finally understood what I had done to my first girlfriend. Not intellectually. Emotionally. I felt it in my body. I felt the confusion, the hurt, the self-doubt, the slow erosion of self-worth.

That’s when I stopped blaming my recent ex. I stopped seeing her as evil. She wasn’t a villain. She was a mirror.

I don’t hate her. I don’t wish her bad. I don’t need her regret. I don’t even need closure from her. I blocked her because I needed peace, not because I wanted revenge.

For the first time in my life, I feel like a karmic loop closed.

I learned that love without presence turns into pain. That asking for time isn’t wrong. That over-giving to someone who’s withdrawing only makes you lose yourself. And that sometimes relationships aren’t meant to last. They’re meant to teach.

I’m rebuilding now. Slowly. Quietly. Focusing on my body, my routine, my career, my inner life. I’m not rushing into another relationship. I don’t feel empty anymore. I feel integrated.

If karma is real, then I think mine was cleared. Not because I suffered, but because I finally understood.

And honestly, that peace feels better than any apology ever could."

we were laughing, forehead to forehead, and i just quietly went:

“will you be my valentine?”

she said yes.

i dropped to one knee like a clown, kissed her belly through her hoodie because i’m dramatic, looked up and she was completely red. my heart was going insane.

we kissed once more, i kissed her broken hand, and then i had to leave because we only get like 5 minutes together on school days. we text \~30 minutes a day and sneak calls on weekends because her parents are strict.

First question is it too early to ask him to Prom? Our prom is in the beginning of May and it’s February 9th when I’m making this post. I’m worried if I don’t ask him someone else might. I’m also worried because his friends might make fun of me if he tells them. It won’t just be me and him, I’ll invite some of my friends and he can invite his friends too. How should I ask him?

1r1mtgp,Its lowkey hard getting a valentines or even a girlfriend as an introverted guy. Any tips? I'm probably autistic too. :(,Relationship,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"Don't know if this should be in relationship or advice but either way...

Theres this one girl I really like, like probably one of those crushes that last a while and you can never escape really. I've liked her since the beginning of my freshman year, and now that I'm halfway done, I still never get the chance to really talk to her. She sits at my table during math one and the only way I could really talk to her is if Im or she is asking a question towards me, or needs some further explaination. And since I'm an introvert, I get so nervous to even ask her how her day was, cause I'm also afraid that since I never really talk to her, she'll assume why? 

I don't really know man..I just don't have the courage to talk to her and it's almost vskentines day. And I don't know where to dtsrt in the first place. I assume this is going to be another year where I don't get a vskentines and will have to wait until next year. I'm not rushing for a valentines though, not really chasing for a girl to like me. And also it's freshman year, most relationships don't seem to last long lol. But either way I would like some tips on how to even just talk to a girl and at least get in close touch (as in like really good friends or even get their number). 

And I know, I'm 15, and I know I shouldn't be worried about relationships so much. But either way, these tips I'm sure would help me find a relationship in the future. So I must start small..right? 

Also sorry if this doesn't make sense, this was suppose to be a small post but started ranting about her lol. And its also sad since im short (I'm 5'4'' or 5'5'' but compared to the other boys at my school, I'm pretty fucking short) and shes like 2 or inches taller than me :( . 

But anyways, hopefully theres some tips you guys have that you mind sharing, even if your already in a relationship that would work too since you could basically just tell me some tips on what you did. If not than thats also okay to.

1r0bj3g,What would you do in my Situation ?,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I 16m and my gf 15f, have been together for around a year and a half. Even though I met her parents very early on and we've known each other for quite a long time, I still think they don't like me.

For explanation, my girlfriend's parents are from Slovakia, so my girlfriend and her parents can speak Slovak fluently. Each time I'm at her house, my girlfriend and her mom are nearly always arguing (in Slovak, of course), and I don't understand a thing. While arguing, both seem very upset, and sometimes halfway through the conversation, I hear my name being mentioned. But every time I ask my girlfriend about it, she says it's nothing to worry about. Recently, however, she told me that every time we meet, she has to work hard to convince her parents, to the point where she has to talk to them for 30 minutes straight, or she even had to cry one time to convince them, even though it should have been just a normal date. Overall, I've never had a good conversation with her parents, and I always feel like they don't care about me and that they don't like me to be at their house.

What do you guys think I should do?

Thanks for any advice!"
1qzxxdx,Things About Life,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Originally, I was planning to just post this on my profile, like with what I did with my other post but this time, I wanted to post it here to motivate you guys too :)

There's many bad things in life, but there's many good things too. It's just that, most people focus on the negative ones (due to our instinct of focusing on negative topics to avoid them) but this leads to the consequence of some people worrying too much. And that's okay! It isn't supposed to be, but it is. I'm experiencing that too! I don't want to, but I am, unfortunately.

We can't always control it, but there are times we can, and if you're lucky or try hard enough, you can make yourself less affected by your negative thoughts.

I'm not saying you should STOP this instinct. In fact, it helps a lot, it's the reason why we still live today. Being aware of danger is good, but worrying too less or too much is bad. You just need the right placement for that. In fact, be grateful that you have it. I'm not saying you appreciate the pain, though, just saying that you should appreciate your awareness of your pain.

No matter what, though, don't forget to stay true to yourself while avoiding the negative side of yourself taking over you. Stay true to your good and best, despite the pain that you and everyone experience, and the pain that you, everyone and I cause. It's okay to make mistakes, just try to avoid making them again but be grateful for learning from them. Just make sure to not underestimate the problem but don't overestimate it too!

I know what I'm saying may be simple but it isn't for others. But whether it's simple for you or not, I appreciate you for reading my post. Thanks a lot!

I might post more stuff like this again, but that really depends on my mood. It can be tomorrow, a week later, a month, maybe even a year and etc. Just remember my message, thank you for reading! :)

Expect this post to be crossposted or have been crossposted since I want my message to be spread. Thanks again for reading!"
1qy3dmb,My bitch of an ex keeps trying to get me expelled or at least a 160 days OSS,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"For context we dated for two weeks before THEY broke up with me, and before this they had made several sexual advances that on multiple occasions I made abundantly clear made me uncomfortable to say the least. Now most of you are probably wondering why I'd date someone like this. At 1:18 in the morning they call me crying saying how much they love me and want to be with me and so on and so forth. I assuming their girlfriend/boyfriend of two years had broken up with them and this made me worry for their health. So being sleep deprived and mildly dazed i said yes. Well fast forward two weeks I get tired of their sexual advances I make one back. Nine people including me thought they committed, 7 hours later they told me they passed on their couch after I made the sexual comment. Advancing time once again to last summer we would talk on and off as friends until they blocked me on everything but through default messaging. I had asked politely for the reason why this happened two hours go by and nothing, I then said ""no reason then?"" They then sent me a several texts saying I was a narcissist, a masochist, a piece of shit, human trash, homophobic, transphobic, ect. I asked them to give examples and they said I didn't support them coming out or something dumb like that. Now today as the most resent example they threaten to report for threatening them with violence for being trans. What should I do about this from a school stand point?"

1qu8hbs,"PLEASE, remember that ""tell an adult"" does not mean you can only tell a parent or legal guardian.",Serious,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"I feel like this is something that needs to be said, especially because a lot of posts I see on this sub are posts from teens asking if something is bad, when (in my opinion) it is extremely obviously bad, and if so, should they tell someone? 

  
No one ever stressed to me that if you are in a dangerous situation, or you are worried about someone you care for, you can tell an adult that is NOT a parent. ""trusted adult"" doesn't inherently mean a parent. a trusted adult can be someone who is neutral to the situation, and that is even the best option, imo. Sometimes, a parent can be the worst person to tell, and often, us teens KNOW that, so we feel unsafe to open up. 

  
This is why I want to stress, that if you are being treated poorly, in an unsafe situation, or worried about the safety of someone you care about and unable to tell a parent, you can tell any adult who can help you. you can tell your principal, a teacher, a doctor - anyone, that you need help. 

  
tl;dr - your parents are not your only option as a trusted adult, and in an emergency or unsafe situation, you can tell an adult neutral to the concern that you or someone else is in danger."
1qudkvt,What's the point?,Serious,Power Imbalance,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"This year in itself have been different from most others years. A lot is the same ofc. I don't talk to anyone no longer. My school cuts corners. A lot of people know shit is fair for nobody.
After years of constantly only knowing about nothing than solitude and a wrenched feeling in my gut I might just lose it.

Ever since 8th grade I've been fighting various anxieties. Prior I hung out, Studdied, focused. Wasn't the best but far from the worst. I was slightly above average in my grades and my parents very supportive about it. I had people who I spent time with and seemed to do well with.
It all went downhill at the start of the 1sy termine. I was suddenly constantly left on read at chat or just ignored. Was lied to behind my back. Left out almost every time and not once in 5 years contacted by a single friend. I was told I didnt belong and that I should avoid joining them on the brakes. Was barely called and heard no worries from anyone after my last S*cide attempt this summer. It was just as if it didnt matter whether I was alive or not. I was generally losing hope after 1 year alone in quarentine that year at 8th grade. No one to talk to and a lot to carry at once with no support from school what so ever. Even having to rely on myself as the teacher didnt leave any educational info or work online for me to view as they thought it was too much to ask for. I got a lung disease and it wasn't really an option to go back durring covid till they knew it wasn't gonna seriously impact me. And I guess it ended up being a false alarm in the end.

9th year was rough and so came my 1st year at swed ""highschool"" I suffered heavy social anxiety and barely entered class for weeks. Wasn't bothered by anyone, just uncontacted. Same as before. My grades slipped of quickly from the 9th grade and I haven't bothered keeping up till today.
I was both too stressed and quite depressed  from experiencing all of thisto get any focus at that point. Yet atleast tried to keep going at a somewhat wacky pace. 

Switched to a different class the year after for a fresh start. Was promised an assiasant for certain amount of hours the year before but got narely nothing and not for the hours I was spoken about. Had to rewrite that contract the comming year due to switching school and classes but due to the complexity and waiting time, I was left to keep going for months before any help was considered although less than promised since the very start which was seen as necessary according to the last Principal.
Took almost a year to get my actuall assisant.

2nd year anxiety, bla bla. I was sick a couple of weeks ago and gone for a few weeks for separate recovery. 
I was recently however kicked out of school for that reason. Their reason being my contract ran out to allow my major absence in 2025 as my mental health was declining and my social anxiety went up and needed a renewal to allow my now and future absence. This as anything longer than a month could get you shut off.

I was sick however durring the time it lapped out. The time after did not in any way add close to a month. Nor did my contract run out as we formed a renewal quite quickly there after.
Yet they have kept trying to kick me out  in similar ways for this entirity.

I was not sent a warning. Nor did the principal do any investigation on my absence which he was required to. Also lying about information they clearly did have to whoever had positions higher than him. There seem to be no major comuncation with them at all for that matter


I also had help at the psychiatrist till august 2024 as I turned 18. Was promised help within 2 months. Took a year and was aparently lost in the system and is yet without any major help durring all that time. It's just after my birthday that any help was offered and I am really thankful for getting something at last.

I have lost a lot of souls durring this long journey who we all mourn but all I know is forward. There is no other way to go.
I've had a depression for 5 years. OCD, ect.
My sleep schedule is wrecked, my life a few steps from being in ruins and the only thing I can do is just keep going and hope something will be different.

I'be tried to change and have done so but I've mever felt like I am enough for anyone. Or else I'd still have people who tried reaching out instead of only that being me.

Probably ended up wacky.
Remembered to add stuff as time caught on. Got no time to change my text anyhow.

1qvslac,I got a seriously underexposed friend (13F) 🤦,Rant,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Okay, I have this friend, let’s call them Bee. We both go to a super religious school, but somehow Bee is on another level of underexposed. I’m probably the least religious person there, but even my more religious classmates know what I’m talking about. Bee? Nope. They’ve never seen *Encanto*, any anime, K-pop demon hunters, *Zootopia*, *Tangled*, or *Miraculous Ladybug*. And forget music—they don’t know Ariana Grande, Sabrina Carpenter, or MJ.

Even superheroes are weirdly limited—Batman, Superman, maybe Spider-Man. Everything else? “Who?” or “Oh, that’s weird.” And when it comes to “dirty” stuff, the wildest thing they’ve searched is “bikini”—they think slang words mean actual dirt.

It’s not just media. Bee is emotionally and mentally immature. I once told them, “Speak up and face me when talking,” and they got offended. I don’t care about physical immaturity—plenty of people are small or shy—but Bee’s brain feels stuck in a bubble. Conversations are exhausting: “what’s that??” and “I don’t know” 100 times in a row. Even obvious questions like “Where are we?” they respond “Oh, I don’t know,” which can be dangerous.

Bee also has a history of ditching friends with weird excuses. They ditched another friend, Lemon, when Lemon had no friends, when Lemon asked Bee what happened Bee told them, “I think you can figure it out,” making Lemon worry for years. Recently, Bee admitted it was because people were being mean to them—but why not just say that at the time?

They ditched me too last year, right when I was being bullied for being queer. I asked, “What’d I do wrong?” and Bee said, “Oh, you know.” This week they claimed it was because I made another friend sad (I told that friend that they were ignoring me and that friend felt bad for doing so) so Bee ""didn't know how to approach"" me, but that doesn’t explain why they said nothing back then. Their explanations never match what they actually say, and it’s incredibly frustrating.

Yeah I think I may leave this one (I won't miss them). Should I?"

Due to past relationships and what has happened this year, he's sick of relationships basically, which I understand, I've been through that since middle school, I know his pain. Everything was fine after that, but this week.. He's been acting weird, he doesn't talk to me anymore, he'll usually call my name out when he sees me during lunch, this week, he doesn't even look at me... :(

On Monday after school, when things started getting weird, I texted him on Instagram, asking if he was okay. He doesn't answer my question, but he replies to my note (which was just me saying how I wished I was taller), so I decided to reply to his. Nothing. He just leaves me on seen.

I'm not upset that we aren't together, im upset that I potentially lost a friendship, I loved being friends with J, he's nerdy, funny, but he's a anxious, awkward, and somewhat emotional guy :( 

So I really hope him doing this isn't out of malice, and all of this is a huge misunderstanding. A lot of people don't like me, mainly because im ""weird"" or its just for petty reasons. Im worried one of these people told him something to make him not like me anymore (as in friends). I really want to talk to him, but im worried that he'll just leave me on seen.

I've lost so many damn friends, Im NOT gonna lose another. If I did something wrong, I will fix it, I WILL make up for it. If there is a reason, and its my fault, I will try my best for him to at least forgive me. I don't know what I did. Its ugh...

All of this has really affected me, so if you guys have any advice to give, please let me know! :3

  
Summary: Friend (who I also have a crush on) has suddenly stopped talking to me, and I want to talk to him."
1qs8l2t,Some unc thoughts I wrote down!,Discussion,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I wrote this down on my notes app a while ago and thought of sharing it today! Let me know if I'm mistaken on some statement (it can be, these are not universal truths) and share your own thoughts

\- Stop prejudices: You don't know that person. They may be having a tough time right now. They may have grown up on a different environment than you. They might be following another culture or way of thinking

\- Comparing one person to another is bad. Everyone is different, in a good and/or bad way. Don't compare 2 people; don't compare yourself to anyone, we tend to think we're worse than them

\- Don't worry about silly things. Don't stress yourself about things that you cannot control. I know it's hard, I still worry. But we need to try not to

\- Psychological fatigue is as important as muscle fatigue: Being stressed (thus producing stress hormones) makes you tired. We need to ""exercise"" both

\- Your beliefs or the rules you follow can change with time. They're not fixed and they should not be.

\- Nothing is permanent, neither the bad stuff, nor the good one

\- Hormones affect A LOT in our mood. This includes all types of hormones

\- Sleeping enough and good quality sleep is necessary. Also, somewhat of a daily routine (going to bed and waking up at similar times everyday)

\- Technology is a tool, and a weapon. Decide how you use it. Same with AI, make a good use

\- Socrates was right: ""I know that I know nothing"". As I get older and mature (hopefully lol) I realise I don't know shit about anything

\- Philosophy is important, not just some old Greeks thinking a lot. Pondering makes you write this kind of stuff :D

\- Subjects (and any field of study) are interconnected. Don't try to separate them, improve your knowledge on one based on the other

\- Knowledge is important. Also, knowing some languages lets you understand things in a deeper context (like where does a word come from)

\- Extremist opinions are always bad. Politics, society... even tastes. You can't say you completely love something and completely hate another"
1qqr8s8,"Do boys think about their ex gf, even if they're in a new relationship?",Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"okay so my best friend (F16) started dating this boy (M18) 2 or 3 months after he got out of serious year and a half relationship, where his ex was his first EVERYTHING. they've been dating for like 4 months, but I still don't really trust him, cuz even when he was with his ex, he kept responding to my bffs text (it was lowkey shitty thing from her to be texting a boy in a relationship, but he was lowkey ignoring my bff and also making fun of her, saying that she is boring and shi while he was with his ex). but last week she came to me saying that she found out that her bf is sometimes still looking at his ex gfs profile and sometimes mentions this ex while he's with his friends. also he is not that attentive to her like he was with his ex, they were together almost every day, always holding hands, being affectionate, she was at his house multiple times a week, but nowdays he is more with his friend than her. she is also sad cuz next week there's a prom at out school and he has not invited her yet and idk if he will, but last year he got the tickets for him and his ex right when school started selling them. another thing he is still texting other girls and that was the main thing that scared her, because he was texting her while still in a relationship and look how that trurned out.
their relationship is kinda okay but im a little bit worried about her.
i asked my other friends and some were saying that he's using her as a rebound or to fill up his loneliness, cuzhe was used to being with his ex almost every day.😭

anyways please help, i really love her and idk how to help her out and what advice should i give her. the first paragraph it's long cuz i wanted to give some background to this question and why am i asking

TL;DR:

My best friend (16F) is dating a guy (18M) who got out of a long, serious relationship shortly before they started dating. I don’t trust him because he texted her while he was still with his ex and wasn’t respectful. Now he still checks his ex’s profile, mentions her, is less affectionate with my friend, spends more time with friends, hasn’t invited her to prom yet (unlike with his ex), and is texting other girls. I’m worried he’s not over his ex and might treat my friend the same way, and I don’t know what advice to give her."

i wanna work in game development, but all the ideas I have are gonna be a struggle to make as a 15 year old with no skill in coding, and a friend who can code, but probably may not be interested in working on smth he dosent take interest in.

I wanna run some of this by him to see if he could  help, but im worried I’m gonna have to slave away at a desk job to make money and I don’t wanna do that, all of my idolized people are living their lives doing things I love, and I wanna atleast do something I care about

  
i don’t wanna ask for much, I just want an opinion on what I should be interested in working on, I make a ton of ideas but I can’t do them because of my heavy procrastination issues and lack of skill

1qoc6cq,What should I do in this situation?,Advice,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"What should I do? So... I am a 13 Y/O therian Buddhist. I can't exactly tell what my sexuality is, but I think that I am pan or bi. My parents, especially my dad, are christian. They talk about how wrong it is to be LGBTQ, not knowing that I am someone completely different behind their backs. I want to tell them because I have a crush on another girl who likes me back, but I am worried if we start to hang out they will become suspicious because she is openly lesbian. I don't have anyone to really talk to for advice, so I am coming here. I want to know if I should tell them or not. Also, I want to go to therian and lgbtq conventions but they would be super against it. Advice would be super helpful thanksss!"
1qnkr4z,I'm extremely scared of passing away and need advice,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"Hi, basically I have no one to talk to about this so I decided to come here for advice to hopefully calm my mind. I'm 15F and sometimes I will randomly start thinking about not existing, what's going to happen when I die and I just start crying, I can't stop thinking about it and it's hard to distract myself. my mind can't fathom what's past this life and I start stressing extremely bad to the point I feel sick. I know I'm young and have lots of life left as I've been told but I really can't stop thinking about it. I want to talk to someone about this but I feel extremely embarrassed as it feels like a silly thought. has anyone dealt with this before? I really just want my mind to feel at ease so any suggestions would be a great help. I don't know what sub I should post this on either so I posted it here since I'm a teen.

sorry about ranting, this also probably doesn't make sense since it's 3am when I'm writing this

Edit: I also wanted to add that the last few years, (this mainly started when I started High school) I had been extremely suicidal, I wanted to pass before my family did, so I wouldn't have to deal with them passing or have to deal with myself anymore. There was a lot more to it but I mainly forgot, I tend to forget easily. I just feel that deep down there's something wrong with me, I can't connect with people easily, my best friend is my mum and when we fight I have no one to talk to. I do have sisters but I don't want to burden them, my oldest sister has lots on her plate and I don't want to make my younger sister worry that she'll go through the same feelings since I'm always told she's a mini me and she's just starting high school tomorrow.

I have always been scared of death but I have always wanted to die, when I listen to certain songs I think that they should play at my funeral. I always used to self harm a lot when I was 12-13, I never cut deep but I'd cut a lot, opening sharpeners and just slicing where it wouldn't be visible. I thought that deep in my mind I was doing it for attention, though I never wanted to show anyone as I was embarrassed. I didn't have that bad of a childhood from what I remember, just the typical young parents who fought a lot and broke up. I stopped self harming because I couldn't be bothered to do it anymore though I still think about it sometimes. Sometimes I'll also think about things, what if I walked in front of a car, falling or other things and I see myself dying in like an almost day dream thing. Then sometimes I'll be peacefully playing stardew valley or just relaxing after working and I'll start to panic, panicking about how I'll be nothing after I die. 

Again sorry about ranting, I'm feeling really low today and I have nothing to do, I'll most likely go for a walk later. I'm about to go back to school Thursday so I'm stressing a bit but I'm not thinking about it as I know I'll make myself upset that the summer holidays went too fast and I didn't do anything other than work and sleep."
1qn0th7,Im 16 and i just really need your help,Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"As I said, I'm 16 and recently I have been realising that I align with a LOT of symptoms people with ADHD have. So I started looking back at my life and I realised I have been showing a lot of these symptoms for a very long time, but I never thought about them too much. I decided to take a couple of online tests and all of them said I was very likely to have ADHD. I don't know how I should tell my parents that I think I have it and that I want to see a doctor, because I started getting worse and worse at school (I used to always have to do more than others to get the same results, but now in the 2nd year of high school, that's really showing), and I don't want to make it seem like I'm just finding excuses. Also, my parents know that I have tried smoking, as well as drinking, and I'm really worried that me telling them is just going to seem like I want to get high. Actually, the opposite -- I don't want to be prescribed anything, so if somebody has a method of how I can deal with it, it would be more than welcome.

So I guess my main questions are:

How do I tell my parents that I think I have ADHD and that I want to see a doctor?

Does anybody know how I can tell if I actually have it, or if I just have some of the symptoms? (I don't want to make a scene in my family just for it to be all false.) Also, English is not my first language, so if I didn't describe something right or anything of those sorts, just let me know!

1qkzuba,I 16M need advice with a potential relationship with 16F,Advice,Sexual Health / Pregnancy Risk,High (direct consent / coercion risk),"PLEASE HELP (Long)

(DISCLAIMER: Sorry if this is inappropriate, I just don’t know if it helped with the story 😭. Tell me if I should remove those parts)

So back in September I met this girl 16F through some mutual friends and we became good friends and I soon liked her after around a month. She was funny, caring, overly kind and attractive. But she had a boyfriend so I didnt make any moves. But as they started splitting I did, we hung out more and she even sat on me and almost kissed me while hanging out with 2 other friends, 17M and 16F. But nothing happened. After she broke up with her boyfriend we started talking more and hanging out more with friends and some one-on-one. Eventually she gave me a HJ in her car. After that she asked me if I liked her and I obviously said yes and I asked her the same, she said yeah but didn’t want to date atm because she didn’t want me to feel like a rebound and others to think she’s hopping guy to guy. So I decided I will wait until she tells me she’s ready. Fast forward a bit to end of November/early December, I went on vacation, when I got back she gave me another HJ and we kissed. It felt amazing but I wasn’t very good at it admittedly. (I only talked to one other girl in my life and we didn’t go out like ever, not my fault I promise 🤞) But it felt alright. And we had a class together but semester just ended so we don’t anymore.  So she told a mutual friend 17M that she liked her ex but also liked me. But her ex went on a vacation the entire month of December and I’m pretty sure she doesn’t like him anymore, but he still has a heart on his contact name… She is also friends with quite a few guys but I trust her deeply and know she’s not the kind of person to cheat on someone. So come Christmas break we become so much closer and do more intimate things like BJ’s and other stuff. We flirt and she comes over to my house quite often. But after Christmas break she almost becomes dry and we go from calling every night to rarely. We rarely hang out 1-on-1. It almost feels like she’s pulling away but she still shows interest. She would hold my hand in the class we had together. She even told the 17M mutual friend she was gonna ask me out after the semester. And she would grab my thigh and talk about how she likes my pants and what’s in them. But then be dry over text and act like we don’t talk like that. I feel it’s gotten worse. I asked one of her best friends 16F if she still likes me and explained the situation. The friend messaged her and asked “If OP were to ask you out rn what would you do?” And she responded with “I’m not sure”. For context it’s during finals and she had just started her period. So hormones  + finals stress could = uncertainty and overall upset-ness? This is like a week ago now. We stop kinda flirting like that and it feels like I’m making all the effort. But her friend told me not to worry because she talks about me a lot and “Likes you A LOT”. I asked her to come over to my house so we can finish this movie together and she said no and to watch I myself. Which granted it was terrible timing as it was before a final she was stressed about and after she was fine because she did good and we acted almost like a couple looking at stuff around the school. I was going to ask her to be my valentines come Valentine’s Day with a gift bag with stuff she liked and take her out and after ask her to be my gf. But at the rate it’s going I might ask her after this next week if she even still likes me. It’s like flip-floppy. She acts like she likes me and we’re almost like a couple and then she acts like we’ve barely talked and she’s annoyed with me. I’m just so confused. And need advice. If anyone has any advice please help me as I’m lost, never been in a relationship and don’t know what to do. Overthinking is killing me and I can’t help but feel I did something wrong and she lost feelings. But her friends said she’s not the type to lose feelings that fast especially after what we’ve done.

Edit 1: also, for context, like on Friday the 9th we hung out and acted like a couple, she put me through her skin care routine and messed with me, putting lip plumper on me. I then kissed her arms and stuff to get it off and to kiss her and she was okay with us playing like that and then we built Legos until I had to leave. But then she acts dry afterwards. I don’t get it 😭

UPDATE: So it’s over. I’ve been talking to one of her best friends to see what I should do to surprise her for Valentine’s Day and she said she didn’t want a valentine and when asked about dating me she said maybe in the future but not now. I just dont understand what i did wrong. If I waited too long. Idk anymore

UPDATE 2: So it’s maybe not over? I talked more to her best friend and contemplated what to do and vented. She helped me write a message to ask if she was still interested in me. I got a response from her and it was along the lines of “idk, I’m kind of conflicted on how I feel rn.” Which I replied with “thank you for being honest. I don’t want to pressure you at all. I just care about you and I. Just tell me what you need or are feeling” which I got a “thank you” in response. So help still needed. Please.

TLDR: She said she feels conflicted on how she feels and I told her that I care about us and she thanked me. Need help.

UPDATE 3: So we play games with her best friend every night and it seems good again other than she can get a bit irritated more than usual (not sure if it’s because of the time of the month or not) but it seems fun and we end the night telling each other goodnight and laughing. But we were supposed to hang out today and when I asked about it in the gc last night she responded “oh yeah, I’m not going” and her friend responded “yeah I lowkey forgot about that”. Granted it’s supposed to be negatives today because of the winter storm but man I’m so confused."
1qkua2e,My mum is almost punishing me for a Christmas present of mine being messed up,Rant,Mixed Signals / Ambiguity,Medium (ambiguity adjacent),"For Christmas I asked for the tuxedo cat lego set because I love lego and I have a tuxedo cat who I love very much. But my mother decided that instead of getting the actual lego set to get a knock off.

While I was building it I noticed some of the pieces wouldn't fit together which really confused me cause I've never had that issue with lego before so after trying for a long time I decided to look it up to see if anyone in reviews had that issue then while reading the box I realised it wasn't lego branded and tuxedo was literally spelt wrong on the front.

So I gave it to my mother and told her the issue and she was understanding and admitted to getting a much cheaper fake but said she would buy me a new one which I was very thankful for.

But then she told me today that she wanted me to pay 60 of it which is over half the price of it but its how much she saved when getting me the fake one. Which I didn't think was reasonable because it wasn't my mistake and also I haven't had a job in a month so I dont want to just be throwing money around.

So I just told her to not worry about it and not to get me the lego but she already had bought it and is basically demanding money and saying about how I should pay her with my savings if I dont have it in my bank. But I do have it in my bank im just not willing to spend it on something I dont really need especially since im moving out in the next year and im broke.

I just dont think she's being reasonable."

They've always been very sweet and good boys, but recently I've been worried about their changing behaviour. One of them watches Jordan Peterson, which was a shock, and some other things like calling their classmates who are feminists or forgave their girlfriends for mistakes as ""simps"". I've always been the 'cool' uncle so I wanted to do like a rap kind of thing to stop what's quickly becoming fascism. As a member of the LGBT+ community I am worried about the path they are going down. Please help with relating to them with the new terms.

  
(backing track begins)  
You know what's awesome? What's that? Trans rights!  
They're right unlike the right!  
For minorities I will always help in their based fight,  
Aight.  
What's cool? Minority rights don't be a fool!  
Afrirmative action gone! Why?  
Because white people just can't get along!

Racism is wrong, uh huh uh huh  
That's why I rap this song  
Racism is wrong, uh huh uh huh  
That's why I rap this song  
Racism is wrong, uh huh uh huh  
That's why I rap this song

(It took me a long time to come up with the chrous.  
I really like how it's to the point  
but also has a cool dance choreographed in.  
I am open to changes,  
but the core messages has to be kept  
so that they can learn responsibility  
about what's wrong and the path they're going down.)

Peterson? He's not strong,  
on trans right he's just plain wrong.  
Oooooohio! Ye ye, going to Oooooooohio!  
Uh huh uh huh.  
What can I do to fight fascism?  
Remember to stand up to Nazism!  
Socialism is where it's at.  
Marganalised and poor... I'll help with that!  
Never going to shame bigger people by calling them fat  
or thin people, making fun of weight is skibidi whack!

(Repeat Chrous)

I'm talking about feminism,  
women are cool and have stength within them.  
So what do you say when your friend says  
""I support women and will forgive them.""  
That's based my peeps! That's chad pilled.  
Based my peeps, supporting women is a standard  
all men should meet.  
So remember this rap if you know what's up  
supporting misogynists is straight messed up.

(Repeat Chrous)

(Those two verses in the 'Peterson' verse really hit home for me.  
I wanted to highlight to them how the rise of fascism in the West has happened before,  
but to do it in like a kind of cool way,  
so what I was going to do when I say the Nazism line  
was tosort of put my hand round my mouth like it's a speaker phone.)

Let's sum up with what's going down  
Some people aren't respecting those around.  
(Background recording: that's cooked yo)  
So what are we going to do to change it up?  
for women and minorities we'll always stand up

they're evil, fascist, and straight up freaks  
No human is illegal!

(Fade out with elongated background recording:  
Ssssiggggmmmaaaa pillllled!)

I'm very worried about the fade out because I wanted to leave them with a strong impression about the importance of the message, but I also kind of wanted to leave it in an upbeat way. Anyway, I'm open to constructive criticism, and if you think I should use modern terms differently then please let me know, and to those reading remember that bigotry is wrong and that you can fight it too."
1qig644,Is this okay to send to my dad?,Serious,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I’ve been struggling with my relationship with my dad lately and my therapist told me I should write my feelings down in a litter to give to him. Anyway, long story short, it’s late in the night but he’s still up, we had an incident tonight where he yelled at me in the car while I was just crying and begging for him to hear me out. 

Anyway, this is what I wrote for him. I’m literally so terrified to send it that I’m shaking rn:

I know it’s late and I’m supposed to be asleep, but I couldn’t fall asleep and my head is feeling clearer, and I need to put my feelings into words at least a bit here. I’m absolutely terrified to send this, but I think I need to.

I need you to understand that I am still your daughter, and you are still my father. That means, no matter how close we are, I do not have control. You are still in control in this situation, which means while you can get angry at me and lash out, I cannot do much. It also means I cannot be expected to hold full emotional maturity. Even if you call me mature, I am still a hormonal teenager with mood swings, and you are an adult parent. You should not be in a position where you are incapable of controlling how you present your emotions to me, and I should not be put in a position where I am actively in distress and have no escape from the situation. When you put me in these situations, I’m terrified, especially since most of the time, I am not given space to defend myself.

I cannot continue being expected to read minds and be perfect. I cannot be expected to have full emotional maturity. And I definitely cannot be responsible for the happiness of my adult parent. I cannot continue being used as a therapist, when you clearly have issues that need to be resolved with one. I cannot keep walking on eggshells, not knowing if in that moment, you’ll be angry, distant, or suddenly very caring. 

And lastly, all the things you complain about me currently doing to you are only a reflection of how you behave with me and have a large portion of my life. You tell me I dismiss you emotions (I just don’t know how to properly respond to them, again, I’m still learning and am still a teenager who is not perfect), yet you dismiss my emotions constantly, either by brushing them off, belittling them, or ignoring them entirely. You tell me I’m not capable of seeing other perspectives, yet you never even try to see mine.

For me, though, the hardest part is that you never acknowledge nor apologise for your mistakes and outbursts. You move on and pretend they never happened, as if each hurtful word doesn’t leave a scar in my mind that never fades. 

I need you to listen to my feelings, and I want you to please find help if you cannot regulate your emotions around your own child and feel the need to place the blame on them for your unhappiness in life. I cannot carry your burdens for you. I apologise for any time I’ve hurt you, but I believe that in some cases, the problem may be deeper than from me.

I don’t want to hurt your feelings. I was going to write something better than this, originally, but after tonight, I need to at least have this for you. I will write something better another time, something that explains other things I have surrounding you.

I’m worried about you. And I’m scared. And I’m tired, and sad, and just empty. I miss having someone I can talk to about anything, who asks about my life and actually wants to listen, who doesn’t yell at me for every mistake. I miss my safe space.   I miss having a dad. 

I’m sorry. Please don’t hate me for this. I love you. I just can’t do this anymore. I don’t know what else to do. This has been going on for years and it never stops. It feels like it’s getting worse. I don’t think you’re a bad dad. And I don’t know, maybe I’m the problem here and just being an idiot. Selfish, like you always say. Or narcissistic, like you said tonight. I’m sorry.

I love you."
1qisv55,"[16M] Found CSAM on Tor, Reported It, Now I’m Worried About Legal and Mental Safety",Advice,General Relationship / Teen Life,Low (general relationship),"I know this will probably be ignored, but I’m posting it anyway. I downloaded Tor because I wanted to browse the internet anonymously. It’s clear that normal internet use isn’t private anymore, and even basic political searches can feel risky. Tor seemed like the safest option.

What I found was illegal content almost immediately.

There were links leading directly to websites hosting child sexual abuse material. This was not hidden or difficult to find. The links were openly shared. The volume of it was overwhelming. Images and videos of children were being distributed without any attempt to conceal it.

I was disgusted and angry. I couldn’t just close the browser and move on.

I started collecting links and usernames so I could report them to the CyberTipline. I organized URLs and pages to make the reports clearer. Every report required seeing more material. The amount of content involving children was disturbing.

I am still a minor myself. That made seeing this harder to process. These were children being abused and exploited, and adults were actively trading the material.

I’ve submitted many reports. I documented usernames, pages, and links. I also interacted with some of the people involved to confirm intent, then reported those interactions. Now I’m worried that my actions could put me at legal risk, even though my intent was to report and stop the activity.

I want these sites and accounts taken down. I don’t want to ignore what I saw.

At the same time, this has taken a mental toll. I feel stressed, angry, and constantly worried about whether I crossed a legal line. I don’t know where reporting ends and personal risk begins.

I need direct advice and safety information. Has anyone done this before without facing legal trouble? Did reporting actually help? Should I stop before this causes more harm to me?

I’m trying to do the right thing, but I don’t know what the safest option is anymore."
